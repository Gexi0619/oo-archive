<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Aug 2018, 15:38</p><p>Remember that vision and specx collects personal information and shares it with third-party companies. That means they collect all of your browsing habits, your personal identity, websites you visit before and after their own, and everything youre doing and sharing about your fetish on their website. These third-party companies stand to make quite a lot of money reselling your data if I can drive a large number of people toward vision and specx.  I strongly recommend everyone join the site immediately so I that a good profit can be made off your backs. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ignored</b>&nbsp;08 Aug 2018, 13:32</p><p>Ignored!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Aug 2018, 13:28</p><p>I have not posted in here for about 3 weeks now and I see no reason to until the trolls leave. I suggest that everyone should go over to "Vision and Spexs"  </p><p>Val if you're reading this why not setup many of the most used threads from "eyescene" in V&amp;S;? I think by having to register there would be no more impersonating others names which is now going on in  here. </p><p>I am not leaving eyescene and I will continue to look in daily but their is no point in posting for the time being. Sadly many have seemed to leave eyescene which is a shame. At this point if eyescene goes away it won't be a major lose. Maybe someone will take it over and figure out how to make people register properly like it should be. If and when that happens I would be the first one to sign up. Then hopefully others like Carrie, Likelenses and Maria will also sign up and prove that I am not them and they were never me.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;08 Aug 2018, 13:16</p><p>I've been visiting Eyescene for more than 10 years, it is a unique place without replacement, and it is sad to see it fall to this state recently because of malicious trolls.  </p><p> </p><p>It should be possible to open a Subreddit that could replace this forum (with labels instead of threads), but also enable us to ban users who come here to cause harm.  </p><p> </p><p>A community cannot exist without rules and users who abide by them, and this is no longer the case here.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2018, 19:48</p><p> I believe that we have driven the likes of Soundmanpt, Likelenses, Cactus Jack, and their fake posters such as Lou, Maria, Carrie, Weirdeyes, and countless others away.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Shinys</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2018, 15:05</p><p>I think the best course of action is to ignore and go about your business.  Stop making idle threats back at the trolls too.  The truth is that if you actually had such personal and bio information, you would have already posted it.  So stop with your own lies. </p><p> </p><p>Learn to love others, not hate.  Remember hacking another person's personal information from their computers is illegal and a crime.  Do you want to stoop as low as them? </p><p> </p><p>Be smart.      </p><p></p><hr>

Here's how easy it would be to find eyescene on google.  Imagine a small pebble in your hand.  Go throw it in the ocean from the beach.  Now go find it...  let me know how long it takes you. </p><p> </p><p>Stop making up bullshit.  Your fake stories are ridiculous enough. </p><p></p><hr>

Do you just have shit for brains? </p><p> </p><p>Typing "Ignoring!" tells all the trolls you AREN'T IGNORING. </p><p> </p><p>Take some advice on your own.

<p><b></b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2018, 14:09</p><p>... </p><p> </p><p>It's bullshit that anyone finds this site on their own.  Try searching in google on eyesight problems and glasses.  I went through 33 pages and still didn't see eyescene.  Keep fantasing that is how people "find" the website.  It's just fake accounts over and over again.  Mostly from Soundmanny and LickyLens.

<p><b>Glass Lenses</b>&nbsp;02 Aug 2018, 14:44</p><p> Thinking back, all of these strange posts began about the time that Lou, and Weirdeyes began their long winded posts. </p><p> Who is Weiedeyes? </p><p> Who is Lou? </p><p> And then Soundproof was getting involved, as was Likelenses, and Cactus Jack. </p><p> So is it possible that all of these characters are really one person? And if so who would it be?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2018, 14:05</p><p>Glasslenses </p><p> </p><p>I've been much too busy lately masturbating as Jim Boice on Yahoo!.  I know that I lied badly when I said I never post anywhere under another name.  But please forgive me.  Hey collusion is no longer a bad word either, right?  Usually I mascarade here as Carrie and pick random names out of my head for a conversation of a few days, then I get bored and stop using them.  It's obviously me.  If people have not figured that out yet, they are not very intelligent.  Now you can expect that I will black out and probably forget I even wrote this post.  It is my health issue.  And I would not even be surprised if I denied ever posting it again.  I can't remember it but it never seems right.  Troll anonymous bastards busted me and I they can fuck off.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glass Lenses</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2018, 22:02</p><p>It is odd that since calling out people here for fake posts, all of the supposed people that used to come here asking about their vision problems, and those of their children has all stopped.</p><p></p><hr>

That includes what you read on a site, your true name information, your email address, how often you visit the site, and what you post to the site. </p><p> </p><p>If you have no problem giving away that much personal information for free about a personal sexual fetish (the real reason most people are here), then go for it.

You are a completely stupid  asshat.  Thanks for showing everyone your ignorance.  The best way to ignore a troll is to say nothing.  and that means you too.  so do us a favor and  </p><p> </p><p>SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT NOT TALKING TO TROLLS, ASSHOLE!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2018, 02:31</p><p>My godness! When people will stop commenting the trolls / jerks posts? I repeat again: Don't give them the importance they don't have! Just ignore! Don't feed the trolls!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>María</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2018, 23:30</p><p>30 Jul 2018, 18:24 </p><p> I also noticed what you are saying about Soundmanpt's posts. </p><p> There is the same pattern with Carrie's posts, and Sounder's posts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2018, 22:57</p><p>Don't feed the trolls and don't feed the jerks either!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2018, 18:24</p><p>It is pretty interesting how almost all of Soundmanpt's postings happen within a few hours of each other.  First he makes a horrendous post.  And then within a few minutes to a couple of hourse, he suddenly retracts the post claiming it wasn't him. </p><p> </p><p>This is a pattern that repeats over and over again.  It is way too coincidental. </p><p>No one else could match up the timing so closely.  I believe Soundmanpt actually does need mental health help.  There is definitely something wrong with him.  </p><p></p><hr>

They collect your IP address including geographic location, site you visited previously, site you go afterwards, type of operating system, type of computer, which postings you make, which postings you read, which ads you click on, which ads you didn't click on, etc.  Over an extended period of time, they develop a profile to know exactly who you are and exactly what your plans and intentions are for visiting the website each time you sign in.  These companies then use that information to send you physical junk mail as well as make personal phone calls for solicitation purposes.

<p><b>JC</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2018, 12:13</p><p>I can see the problem many have with the fakes, but for me at least it is a lot easier to look past them then it is the other trolling, political content, name calling, etc. </p><p> </p><p>After about 20 years I still enjoy seeing what people have found on the web (but it makes me sick to my stomach to see people harassing poor girls with stupid comments and questions after they've been posted here), and I enjoy reading the occasional real life sighting or nearsightning that pops up. </p><p> </p><p>If you can look past the vast majority of nonsense that has been here lately there is still a trickle of real content coming in.

<p><b>Concerned</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2018, 09:53</p><p>I agree with the poster below about the fakery being part of the downfall of this site. The problem is that ultimately there is only so much that can be said about glasses, eyesight and girls with glasses. Millions of words have been written on the subject here over the years. However obsessions dont respect this, theyre very insistent and the individual afflicted with the obsession needs to seek out more and more outlandish ways to get their fix. This leads to made up characters and fabricated scenarios in an attempt to steer the discussion in a direction that satisfies the obsession, at least in the short term. The obsession also blinds the individual to reality to a degree and leads them to write things that to an outsider are plainly ludicrous and implausible. Its sad but I think an inevitable extension to what this site exists for. Originally I think it was set up as a kind of support group for people with an optical obsession, a well meaning place for them to discuss related issues and a comforting place for those who in everyday life knew of no one else with same interest. Before Eyescene it was pretty difficult to get ones optical obsession fix but this site and others like it made it so easy and speeded things up. Soon, discussing issues with like minded folk and looking at pictures of girls in myodisks became the norm and ceased to be enough to satisfy the obsession. Hence the fabricated and wild and fanciful scenarios. </p><p>I dont bear the fakers ill will but I dont know what the answer is. Professional help? Maybe but Im willing to bet that most optical obsessives enjoy their obsession and wouldnt want to be without it. Such is the pernicious nature of the obsession.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2018, 04:34</p><p>The biggest problem with Eyescene has nothing to do with recent trolling.  It has to do with the name fakery that has been allowed to volcanically erupt over the past few years.  Nothing is real here anymore.  I've sat back mostly on the sidelines watching how users with same writing styles are creating multiple names posting repeatedly fake stories over and over.  It has grown so old, yet they try to validate their fakery by saying the fake users have been here for years.  Yes, we know.. they have been faking those stories for many years now.  Longevity doesn't prove anything.  It's no wonder everyone left and people are just mocking it.  There isn't anything left good here.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JC</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2018, 13:12</p><p>Unfortunately yes, someone could easily register multiple names, and IP address can easily be changed to show as coming from anywhere in the world by using an inexpensive VPN service.  Registering usernames however does cure the trolls posting under established names.  Short of requiring someone to submit a photo ID when registering I don't see how you can eliminate the possibility of someone living out their multiple personality fantasy.  </p><p> </p><p>But really, does anyone really think the possibility of someone posting under different names is the number one problem with this site right now?  At least if it is happening it is on-topic content.  The problem we have here is the rampant tolling, political content, name calling, etc.  What eyescene really needs is for the moderator to step up to remove the off topic madness and ban the IPs (which is just a whack-a-mole game for the reason I stated above but is better then nothing).  I really hope moonshiner does step up, or we all do finally decide to move to vision-and-spex once and for all.  The reason I haven't is it seems to me that site is more centered around fictional stories -- there is nothing wrong with that except for that it simply isn't my cup of tea.   </p><p> </p><p>I'm sentimental and attached to eyescene -- if I remember right I first found this community when I was in high school and I just had my 20th reunion.  Let's hope moonshiner returns!  </p><p></p><hr>

Even if you mathematically create a number based on the IP address, the result will be a fairly consistent number.

Sorry to tell you complainer but, as others have said, the photos are in the public domain and no permission is needed to publish a link to such photos. It would be different if the photo was copied and uploaded to a website with no credit to the original publisher. On Eyescene only links can be posted. If the owner of the photo makes it private then the link won't work. </p><p>There are people out there obsessing over women in much creepier and wierder ways than photos of women wearing glasses. Worse still there are people out there who get their kicks from watching child pornography! </p><p>Eyescene is completely public and is not aimed at men in particular. Actually there is only one section specifically for posting links to images of women and that's the "Actresses" section. There is a section specifically for images of men "Guys in glasses". All the other sections are not gender specific. What does the complainer think of the links in the "Guys in glasses" section? Are they concerned that there could be straight women looking at those images and pleasuring themselves. </p><p>Yes, the majority of the posts are about women but there is nothing stopping women posting about men. Personally, I won't be putting anything much, if anything, about men as I am a woman who prefers women. I am also a glasses wearer who likes wearing glasses and, yes, seeing women in glasses. I look at photos but I don't comment. It may seem hypocritical but my social media is private. I might be in friends photos but no-one on Eyescene would know if it was me if they happened to find such a photo. </p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if I found photos of me on websites for people who like women with big boobs, but I am not going to go looking. I could go looking and I could complain but I just can't be bothered. Anyway, none of the photos would show me naked.</p><p></p><hr>

I clicked on a link to notify the administrator or something along those lines.

I shut the link quickly and ran my anti-virus software. Luckily my pc was pl. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe I was on a phishing site, but I am wondering whether anybody else has had this happen, as to be honest, I haven't tried going on there again, in case the same thing happens. </p><p> </p><p>Best wishes </p><p> </p><p>Lou</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2017, 09:10</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p>There was a revision by the server owner that has made Vision and Spex much harder to use.  You will need to log onto the site. </p><p>I have not got everything figured out yet, but here is what I have learned. </p><p>The initial Forums screen is not very useful.  There is no indication of which of the Forums have anything new (e.g. different color).  You can scan the date and time of the most recent post in the column on the right. </p><p>A better choice is to click on the Discussions tab. </p><p>Near the top of Discussions screen are a 4 choices: </p><p>"ALL  UNREAD  SUBSCRIBED  PARTICIPATED" </p><p>If you click on UNREAD, it will give you a list of the posts you have not read.  I don't know what the last to do. </p><p>At the top of the screen are some icons, If I remember right, the "envelope" will allow you to compose a post. </p><p>I really prefer the previous version.  As our friends in the UK say, "This version is too clever by half". </p><p>I have been in the Computer Hardware and Software creation business for many years.  I leaned the hard way that every program is "User Friendly" to the person who wrote it.  Ordinary mortals are sometimes SOL.  Newly hired programers hated it when I insisted that any programs we wrote and published be intuitive.  We wrote manuals, but assumed they would not get read. </p><p>This new version of V&amp;S; misses that mark by a mile or a kilometer, at least. </p><p>Good luck! </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2017, 04:17</p><p>NNVIS reminds me of those people who always twist the meaning of words to fit their own situation.  What is going on here really?  Someone is clearly making up identities so often this has simply become a fictitious writing board and no longer value to anyone.  All the real users have left.  So a few others decided to make a name, have a conversation, then the name disappears forever and a new one shows.  The situations are non-sensical and clearly fake postings generated to satisfy a fetish desire.  Bullshit explanations have been offered like how easy it is to find eyescene with a simple google search.  Try it sometime.  I searched a few minutes ago on eyes and glasses, and after thirty pages, eyescene still doesn't show up in the results.  Most people don't go flip beyond thirty pages looking for results, so the conclusion that they find it on google is incredibly naive.  If you want to talk about bullying, let's talk about the serious harassment from hot-headed eyescene users who shit over anyone who dares to get to the bottom of this problem.  Spewing mouthfuls of diahhrea at the person, enough to fill six toilets.  There is nothing wrong with finding out whether this is a fiction board or not.  There are categories for fiction stories and fiction should go there.  Many of the users who have left were looking for real stories until users started making up bullshit for their fantasies.  Stop trying to pass off as sixty different people and get a life.  If you think trying to investigate a situation is bullying, I bet you really hate cop drama shows.  Stop being a bully and interrogating him.  Waah.  My feelings are hurting.  Grow up.  We all want the truth here, you naive wankers.  Let's get it.  Put all the fiction in the fiction topic. Stop bullying people who raise questions about the fake people posting.  I have said enough and I say it anonymously.  It is funny how some people here think every single anonymous poster is one person.  I know I am not those other people.  Accept the fact there are other people who hate what is going on here too.  Grow up.  Sift out the bullshit fiction and move forward.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NNVisitor</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2017, 10:13</p><p>There's a word for what the anonymous poster is doing. It's called bullying. It's a tactic used to demean and smear someone's reputation.

Since there is no "sign in" you have to rely on either an IP block, or a cookie block. IP's may rotate, and cookies are easy to remove and only valid on whatever machine the cookie is dropped on. Often, IP addresses rotate so often that a more general block, using the first two groups of numbers are used. Unfortunately, those blocks wipe out large blocks of users.  </p><p>Having a sign-in system has been debated many times over the last 20 years. I remember having these discussions with Wurm. The though is that many interesting posts would be lost because people do not want to go through the process of setting up an account. This would be especially true of the occasional newcomer who just learned of the board.  </p><p>On the other side of the issue, having an open system requires a lot more active management deleting the occasional flames. When a major breakout occurs, IP blocks become the only tool to cool things down, as such, non-offenders will always get swept up in the blocks, which is unfortunate.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Catwoman</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2017, 14:11</p><p>Soundmanpt: </p><p> </p><p>My "drop-temple" glasses were all plastic, and they fit me just fine.  The only time any pair of glasses slips a bit is when I work up a "shvitz" working out or when the temperature and humidity are quite high.  As for my eldest daughter, she is a bit on the modest side and has not shown any indication toward wearing the drop-temples in public as of yet.  My younger daughter has little interest in that frame style.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2017, 10:58</p><p>Catwoman </p><p>Are your "drop-temple" glasses a full plastic frame or more like a semi-rimless metal frame? They were made several different ways back then. Too bad your daughter doesn't wear them out in public. It would be interesting to see what reactions her friends would have seeing her wearing those glasses. I'm sure she would get some interesting comments on her glasses. Honestly I really think those glasses had a certain style about them Like i said the only problem was that because of the temple being lower they were hard to keep adjusted so they didn't slide down constantly. You wore those glasses for a good while do you remember having any problem with your glasses sliding down more then any of your current glasses? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Catwoman</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2017, 10:08</p><p>Soundmanpt: </p><p> </p><p>Where to begin?  Well, thank you for the welcome, and for letting me know that "drop-temples" is the name for my "upside-down" glasses.  FYI, I graduated from high school in 1984, but I continued wearing those glasses for 2 years in college.  They were big and brown, and my daughter only wears them basically around the house, using small plastic frames for normal wear.  My other daughter wears small cateye frames, not as angular as most of mine are.   </p><p> </p><p>My husband, daughters, and I have always worn eyeglasses, never contacts.  The astigmatism is quite strong for all of us.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2017, 11:36</p><p>Catwoman </p><p>So nice that you have decided to join in and not just be a lurker. You seem to be a woman with a passion for her glasses and you wear your glasses with style. How nice that you currently have 7 pairs of "cat-eyes" in your prescription so you can wear a different pair each day of the week. You even several more frames in waiting should your prescription change or you decide to replace one of them. The glasses you were wearing in your 1986 high school yearbook with the temples on the bottom were called "drop-temples" I remember them very well. They were very popular for several years. I dated several young ladies that wore that style of glasses and they all had the same problem. They were constantly pushing their glasses back up because they didn't want to stay up in place very well. But I really liked the way they looked on young ladies. your daughter must also think they look nice if she even had her own prescription put into them as her backup pair of glasses. Do you know if she has wore them out much? I have to think she would get plently of comments as well as complements on her glasses. As you know you just don't see that style anymore and that's really too bad. Seeing her wearing your old glasses had to bring back memories of when you wore those same glasses back in high school. It seems at least one if nit both your daughters have the same passion for their glasses as you have? Have they both only wore glasses and never bothered with contacts?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Catwoman</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2017, 10:19</p><p>I have been reading items on this website for a number of weeks now, so here goes my first post. </p><p> </p><p>I have worn eyeglasses since age 6.  My husband has worn glasses since he was 7, so our 2 daughters started early as well (6 and 7 respectively).  Each of us went full-time immediately. </p><p> </p><p>I am using the moniker of "Catwoman" because we have 4 cats at home, and I own and wear 7 pairs of cateye glasses (1 per day per week).  In addition to the 7 pairs I use each week, I have others waiting to be used upon a prescription change or if I want to wear something different. </p><p> </p><p>Before I started wearing cateyes in 1986 (and I have worn no other style since), I wore glasses with the temples on the bottom for several years before that.  When she first looked at my picture in my high school yearbook, my eldest daughter said, "Mom, why were you wearing your glasses upside down?"  I told her it was a style back then, and I showed her the frame.  When she got older, I let her get her prescription in those glasses, which she uses as a backup pair.  And I did wear my cateyes in my college graduation picture.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2016, 16:38</p><p>there have been tons of fakes on Vision and Specs.  Why?  Because most of the fakers get bored here and move over there to continue thier fakery.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>manyatime</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2016, 14:15</p><p>I've joined &amp; posted on Vision &amp; Spex several times, using different personae. Once, in reply to an obvious fake, I pretended to be someone whose myopia was increasing rapidly. This was as a way of taking the pi** out of the person posting. I got bored of that within two or three posts. On another occasion, I deconstructed another fake who has never since reappeared on the site.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2016, 11:21</p><p>I think all this nonsense is pretty much impossible to stop. Controlling it is the best that can be done. That requires constant vigilance and a team of moderators. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2016, 09:20</p><p>Val </p><p>As far as I ever knew that was always the thing about Vision and Spexs that I liked.

<p><b>Val</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2016, 00:53</p><p>I am the admin of Vision and Spex, and I can say that rarely I was forced to block users or IP addresses because of a user with more the one accounts. It's hard to know for sure it's the same person.  </p><p>When I started Vision and Spex, 5 years ago, I wanted to have a confirmation from every new user that the email address they provide is valid. I had to abandon the idea, because I have received almost zero confirmations. Some people registered more than once because their accounts could not be activated. They could not post anything. </p><p>The sad thing is that our community is shrinking. In the year 2000 when I joined Eyescene, the site was very active. I remember that any new topic could create about 30 comments in only one or two days. Now, except "Seen on the web" with tons of links, no topic can produce more than 5 comments a day.   </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

It becomes more of a problem when wrong or bad advisory from fake or amateur opticians can be assumed to be proper medical advise by some readers...

<p><b>Concerning</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2016, 12:18</p><p>My Eyescene Posting for the day: </p><p> </p><p>Puffin:  I apologize for my part in the boredom that you are experiencing.  It is why my postings on the subject of absurdity will be under "Site Feedback and News" and not on any other threads. </p><p> </p><p>Soundmanpt:   </p><p> </p><p>First of all, being on Vision and Spex is absolutely no proof of anything.  Any of us could register for several hundred e-mail accounts and be on there as several hundred individuals.  Do you really think that little of the rest of us to not realize that?  </p><p> </p><p>Secondly, I am not accusing you of being Maria or Carrie.  Do I believe that they are females?  Not at all!!!!!!  Carrie is someone who loves plus prescriptions, has a lesbian fantasy, and likes large mammillary glands.  Maria is some guy who loves collecting or the thought of collecting many pairs of women's fglasses and the idea of wearing them. </p><p> </p><p>Both could prove otherwise by taking a multitude pictures with their hands holding each of their pairs of glasses in front of them from the chin on down.  They could crop their face completely out of it.  Maria has no problem taking pictures of a pair of glasses.  She should be able to have many posted of her personally holding each pair that she purchases.  Carrie should be able to post quite a few pictures too.  Just crop the face out.  Privacy is protected! </p><p> </p><p>Instead, we can expect indignation at the thought of this.  They should be able to accomplish this in the next 24 hours otherwise.  More than one picture too!!  It should be so easy to do. </p><p> </p><p>Thirdly, you have no credibility.  You posed as a retired optician, Jim Boice,  on Yahoo and other sites.  Yes, you do use different identities.  As Jim Boice, you, in the guise of a trained optical professional do everything you can to put people in glasses who may not need them, increase the wear time, get stronger prescriptions, and purchase glasses without a valid prescription online. Zenni seems to be a favorite of his too.  Seriously, what optician, retired or otherwise, would promote online competition and buying glasses without a valid prescription?  Why would they promote competition that may do away with the jobs of the people that followed them into the profession. </p><p> </p><p>Jim Boice's and your posts on here could be swapped because they are identical.  If anyone actually cared, they could check this out for themselves.  There are hundreds of Jim Boice posts on Yahoo alone.  OR..... has the account been suddenly deleted the past few days?  That would be mysterious. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Seriously, is your drive to put people in glasses, have them wear them more than they need to, or get them in stronger glasses so strong that you don't care that your advice may go against the advice of a professional in the industry?  What set of ethics or moral compass??</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2016, 08:24</p><p>Concerning, Worth Repeating, Concerned, I Detective, no name and all the others accusers </p><p>It occurred to me that I have proof that I am who I say I and that Carrie is who she says she is. In order to be in "Vision and Spexs" you have to register and as far as I know you're only able to do that as one person. So I suggest that you check in there and you will find that I have been in there for a good while and Carrie is there as well. Not possible if we were the same person. So if you're wrong about me being Carrie, which you are, maybe it's time you stop falsely accussing other people without actual proof. Now of course i'm sure even seeing real proof you will never admit to being wrong. </p><p></p><hr>

Stop portraying yourself as one and doling out advice that you are not qualified to give.

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2016, 06:10</p><p>To Yeti posted on 20160327 </p><p> </p><p>For me , my real world life with girls is very satisfying . I don't always search for the super high rx ones. but there are many moderate rx that surrounds me. I feel very satisfying. And I love it when my stance towards glasses wearing girls are more welcoming than the average attitude exist in the real world. Partly because I am a glasses wearing girl , but also because I don't share the common preference for wearing contact lenses. I think wearing REAL minus glasses is better than wearing the EASILY INFECTED and fake-looking contact lenses. You don't have to wear contact lenses to show that you are attractive. I find the social stereotypes given to glasses wearing girls are much more attractive to me. That we are nerdy and boring , yes, and I love to be nerdy and boring, but I would also tell you how comfortable it is to be glasses wearing girls than a easily-infected, pretend-to-be-normal CONTACT lenses wearing girls.</p><p></p><hr>

You have a nice family and I hope your husband is supportive of your vision problems.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2015, 18:24</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p>Glad to hear you are recovering to the point where the cane is optional. </p><p>It reminded me of my experience with crutches after I broke my Fibula a few years ago.  It was my first encounter with crutches and I asked my Dad, who had suffered serious leg wounds in WW 2 and was on crutches for over a year, when I would know that I no longer needed them.  He said: "One of these days, you will need something across the room and you will just go get it without your crutches, because it is more convenient.  That is the beginning of the end of needing the crutches".  He was right. </p><p>I have a torn Meniscus also, but thankfully it isn't much more than an occasional nuisance.  I hope I can avoid getting it fixed, ever. </p><p>C,</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2015, 17:19</p><p>soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>I'm glad to hear that your knee is getting better.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2015, 15:01</p><p>Crystal Veil </p><p>Well it has been slowly getting better. But I have still been keeping my cane in hand just for safety purposes, but on Wednesday I met a friend and golf partner at a local pub for dinner. I had him put my cane on his side since that was a better place to get it out of the way. But he got up to get something and knocked over my cane. Well to honest it was in bad shape as the handle was badly broken and ready to fall off, well he bumped it and it fell on the floor and the handle completely broke. He insisted that he wanted to fix it for me and he is very good with wood working. He took the broken pieces of the handle with him and I still carried the cane and without a handle it was much more difficult to use. Today he called me to tell me he had made me a new handle and I needed to bring the rest of the cane to his house so he could glue it on. Well he glued it and insisted on staining it as well to make it look even better. He did a great job making a new handle. Anyway after he finished he told me I can't use it for at least 12 hours and even better if I wait until tomorrow to use it. So I had several errands to run and was forced to walk without the aid of my cane. Now I feel like i hardly need it after making my errands without any problem. So it looks like I will have a cane if and when the other knee decides to have an issue. But I really hope to put it in a corner somewhere and let it gather lots of dust. lol </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;25 May 2015, 00:29</p><p>Soundman - I had a meniscus repair in January this year, I  landed after a long haul flight at 7am checked into hospital at 11am, out of hospital by 8pm.   One half hour appointment the following morning to give me a half a dozen exercises to practice and on another plane to some where else the day after that. </p><p> </p><p>Four months on I can still feel a little discomfort but I have full flexibility in the joint and no problems walking for several hours at a time.  The US overdo things.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;24 May 2015, 21:29</p><p>soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Good luck with your knee surgery.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 May 2015, 16:50</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p>You are a very wise man. I am not crazy about being knocked out for 2 hours. The surgery takes about 45 minutes to an hour and then another hour in recovery. But I was shocked to be told that he wants me in therapy on the 3rd day after surgery. As near as i have found out I think the therapy is for 3 times a week and 6 - 8 weeks. As you might guess the surgery is arthoscopic so I will only have a couple small holes. </p><p>Thanks for the good wishes and I will be glad when it is over.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;22 May 2015, 13:12</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p>I have had more surgeries than I care to think about, but never knee surgery. I suspect that surgery for a torn meniscus is not far in my future.  I know there are other knee surgeries that are much more serious. </p><p>Several years ago I had hand surgeries on both hands for Dupuytren's Contracture.  The surgery itself was not bad, I slept thru the whole thing, but the very important therapy afterwards was most memorable, in a negative sense.  When the surgeon said to come in a few weeks after the surgery to get the bandages removed, he said to plan on two hours.  "WHAT! Two hours to take off the bandages?  "No" he said, "That will only take about 5 minutes, but you can't leave until you can make a fist."  He knew what he was talking about.  Fortunately, the later therapy sessions were much easier. </p><p>I suspect the therapy after knee surgery will be "interesting" in the Chinese sense and I wish you the very best outcome and speedy recovery. </p><p>If anyone comments that any surgery is "minor" surgery, there ain't no such thing, except possibly, surgery on somebody else. </p><p>All the best. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;22 May 2015, 12:42</p><p>Best of luck with your operation, Soundmanpt.  And when the doctor asks you afterwards how you feel, just say, "I can't kick."  :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 May 2015, 10:01</p><p>I do try and take everyone at there word and I never call anyone a fraud. In the case of jason there was still enough to believe things he was saying and just assume he wasn't aware of some things.  </p><p>I'm not sure why anyone gets any enjoyment out of making up stories? I don't look at it as a waste of tie because i have a problem with my knee so I am waiting to get surgery on it which is finally coming June 1st,. So since I unable to walk very well I am pretty much home bound so answering him wasn't a big deal. Not like it took me away from something else more important. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;22 May 2015, 09:17</p><p>Well said Cactus Jack.I was suspicious of Jason as well. I have been a lurker here for many years but don't post often but his story did pique my interest so that is why I posted to the thread.A couple of things really stood out. If indeed what he telling us was true why did his girl friend keep going back to the same doctor?I don't know how any doctor could possibly be that incompetent 4 times in the past twenty months was a little too much in my mind. Also his English and spelling were both exceptionally poor and it was hard to figure out exactly what he was saying and I had to read his posts several times to try to make heads and tails out of them. I wonder what country Jason is from because it doesn't sound to me like it is the USA. </p><p> </p><p>And as far as dilation goes I never had an experience with it or know anybody who did like Jason's girl friend supposedly did. I didn't know there was a difference depending on whether you have myopia or hyperopia so that had to be the giveaway to you that he is a fraud. I learned something today and have learned so much from you and the other experts here through the years. </p><p> </p><p>But we have to assume that all the people who write here are being honest and are looking for opinions and advice but that is not always going to be the case.Jason is not the first fraud and won't be the last I am sure. But Soundmanpt and I both took Jason at his word and tried to help him.Even though I thought and I am sure Soundmanpt did too that some things about Jason's story did not make a whole lot of sense. Our goal at Eyescene is to try to help people deal with vision issues and to offer our opinions and give advice. Who knows why frauds post here? It may be that people don't have anything else better to do with their time and think it is funny. But as you said if a fraud posts here that person needs to have all their facts straight or else the person will give him or herself away. And I guess Jason did with the comments he made about dilation.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;22 May 2015, 06:49</p><p>Suspicions confirmed, but I have to award Jason some points for cleverness.  The problem was that he was too clever by half, as our friends in the UK might say.  Some of the descriptions about the effects of dilation did not make sense, technically, for a person who is moderately nearsighted.  I don't want to go too far into the errors, but people who are mildly myopic have different experiences with dilation than people who are hyperopic.  The descriptions more closely fit hyperopia than myopia, which Jason's gf allegedly had. </p><p>Technical errors tend to destroy the effectiveness of fiction writers.  To enjoy reading fiction, you pretty much have to temporarily suspend disbelief, but even a tiny technical error can create a "poof!" moment that destroys the mood for someone who has any knowledge of how something really works. </p><p>My advice to Jason is to do your homework on even the shortest of stories or simple hoaxes.  They have to be believable under the circumstances. </p><p>C.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2015, 05:00</p><p>Moonshiner, </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for deleting those depraved declarations.  This Friday, which will be the 51st anniversary of getting my first pair of glasses (definitely not a fun day then), will also be 11 years since I began posting on this sight -- uh, site (LOL).   </p><p> </p><p>I have learned a lot about vision over the years, making relevant posts on it, but my main goal has been to convince other women that wearing big, bold, and beautiful glasses can be a good thing.  "Love me, love my glasses;" "If you've got it, flaunt it;" etc.  In my case, I cannot function without glasses, so I have made the best of it. </p><p> </p><p>I find it interesting that some male individuals want to see what I look like, yet they rarely, if ever, ask other women to do the same.  I figure it's because of my fabulous eyewear collection, which excludes the little, dull, metal or rimless frames that have been so prevalent for the past 20-25 years.  I also notice that they seem to get their jollies in chasing other women away, such as Ginaa in the most recent case. </p><p> </p><p>For all, I am generally a private person.  I am not on any form of social media -- not Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Flickr, Instagram, Billy Graham, Billy Club, nightclub, Grand Order of Occidental Nighthawks, Chicago Blackhawks, Flyers, nothing.  If people want to see me in all my glasses glory, next time you are in my region, look for a woman about 5'10", wearing a dress or a blouse and skirt, with large-framed glasses, mainly drop-temples or cat's-eyes, usually in the same color.  </p><p> </p><p>My apologies for the long rant, but it is just something that I had to say.

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2014, 15:35</p><p>Moonshiner, I must go against Brian Webber's request to remove the video in question. I watched this video first on CBS news, and I felt that it was a wonderful thing that was being done for this young boy who is going blind.  I do not feel that this video is inappropriate in any way, and since it was first aired on a public television new segment, it has already positioned this young boy in the public eye.  By bringing his plight to the readers of Eyescene this could help this boy if there are any of us here that could be of hesitance to him in attaining any of the remaining items on his bucket list.  Also, it does bring to everyone's attention the fact that vision problems are actually a very serious problem and are not to be taken lightly. </p><p>I am pretty sure that this video is acceptable under the terms that you have posted on te FAQ page.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2014, 21:43</p><p>Thanks for the advice Michael</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2014, 14:59</p><p>Galileo </p><p> </p><p>Never download anything that you don't know what it is. When an update is available for flash player I get a message from Adobe that an update is available and then download and install it. Don't ever download flash player from another web site other than Adobe. Or else there is a good chance you will put malware on your computer. Also be careful of messages that appear to come from Microsoft but don't that say your computer has infections and do you want to clean up your computer. Always click no. I can't emphasize that enough. Because if you click yes all you will do is infect your computer. As long as you have an updated anti virus anti spyware program on your computer don't worry about these messages if one does appear.They are phony. </p><p> </p><p>I used to oversee the computers in the community room of my apartment building and a couple of times people saw one of those messages and clicked yes that they wanted the computer cleaned up. And what happened after was the computer was one huge mess. System restore is a good tool to use to fix computer issues as long as you can go back far enough. If you run into a problem you have to remember exactly when the problem began.You only can go back so far using system restore which brings your computer back to the state it was in on an earlier date. But sometimes if you computer gets infected system restore will become disabled and won't work. Then you can try to use it with the computer in safe mode. Sometimes it might work that way but there is no guarantee. </p><p> </p><p>Just be careful when downloading things. if you don't know what it is and what the program does my rule of thumb is don't do it. And one more thing. As long as you have flash player installed on your computer you shouldn't have to download it again to view any web site. Even if you have an older version of flash player the web site in all likelihood still should work.I don't know what you use for a browser but if you use Google Chrome flash player is already included in the download so you don't even have to download and install flash player separately.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2014, 10:40</p><p>It's nice to see (through a unisex blue pair of glasses at this moment) Eyescene back up again.  I also had the "Bandwidth Exceeded" message the past two days in both Mozilla Firefox and Internet Exploder. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2014, 08:44</p><p>I have had the same experience Specs4ever describes, on a number of websites recently.  I just exited the sites since I know I have flashplayer.

<p><b>Owlish</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2014, 08:39</p><p>Good to see Eyescene back online. I've been getting a "Bandwidth exceeded" message for a couple of days now.  From the lack of new postings it looks as though others got the same and the website was truly down.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Val</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2014, 16:03</p><p>S4E, I think that it will be better if I send your message to  the tech support. Maybe they will find an answer.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2014, 10:15</p><p>Hi Val:  Actually I do not think I clicked on one of the ads. I clicked on a story and it brought up a screen telling me that my flash player needed to have an update installed.  Being fairly computer literate I immediately did the "con alt del" and shut it down. I then went on the internet to see what I could find for information on this. The following is what I found: </p><p> </p><p>Fake update of Flash Player Pro from unknown web sites is the most common source of malware these days. The next time you receive a warning stating that Your Flash Player may be out of date. Please update to continue please ignore it. As much as possible, decease your connection from the Internet before you click on any button of the pop-up box. You must know that this fake update of Flash Player Pro intends to download malware onto your computer as soon as you intervene with it. </p><p> </p><p>On other times, it will pop-up as a box saying Download Flash Player Pro. Same as the mentioned earlier, it tries to force you into downloading a malware that is pretending to be an update from Adobe Flash. Be aware that Flash Player Pro virus may be deceiving. Malware authors make it look real so that it can mislead computer users. The only sign to confirm that it is fake is the originating address of the file. If Flash Player Pro is hosted on unknown or suspicious web sites, better ignore it. If you really need an update to any of the programs installed on the computer, it is safer to obtain them by going to developers official web site and download page. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Val</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2014, 06:30</p><p>I am sorry, but I still have no news regarding Vision and Spex.  </p><p>I use Google Chrome on W7. My antivirus is Nod32 and I also use Spybot Search and Destroy. I didn't get any notice when I visit the site about any virus present.  But I don't click on the ADS present on the page.  Maybe one of the ads is triggering some software installation that could be a virus. </p><p>Meanwhile, DO NOT CLICK THE ADS.   </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2014, 16:18</p><p>Hi Revolver: </p><p>I am not sure if Val has figured out what the problem is.  There were some posts over there from other folks that  were saying that they had not had any problems.  But I know I had to "control_alt_delete" to get to task manager and close the site to prevent an automatic installation of a virus/malware. </p><p>Since then I have only been using a linux based computer (Ubuntu 14.4) to check that site. </p><p>I will e mail you shortly.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2014, 14:11</p><p>S4, this is the proper forum to post the bad news about a virus on the other site.  Otherwise, we might go there and find out about it the hard way.  Is there an update as to whether the webmaster has the problem solved yet?  I have no way of checking there with a linus machine and there is at least one story that is awaiting part three.  Also, as it is getting to be that time of year again, send me an e-mail.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2014, 14:21</p><p>This isn't really eyescene news, but since a lot of eyescene visitors generally go to Vision and Spex to read the fantasy stories I thought I had better let you know that my antivirus had blocked me from going to Vision and Spex.  It tells me that there is a malicious virus there, and I did try to go around it to enter the site. Sure enough something tried to hijack my computer.  When I checked it out on Google it is a supposed update to firefox flash player that is indeed a fairly serious virus.  I have mentioned it to Val so that he can look into it. </p><p>In the interval I will be using a linus machine to venture into Vision and spex.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2014, 18:54</p><p>Sorry folks but the e Bay listing I posted ended up being for only one sale.  My fault because I jumped on a List it Free deal and didn't realize I had to pay for the listing if I wanted to do multiple copies. I have a new listing for Dlb on there right now and as soon as he either completes the transaction or lets it go the 24 hours I have suggested he has I will relist this as a pay for deal with multiple copies available.  Bear with me please.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2014, 21:08</p><p>Since Bobby has gone to a blog type site I have not wanted to place any of my new stories on there. I have developed quite a backlog of tales, so I have combined 10 new stories into an e book and I am selling it on e Bay. The book is called A Collection of Glasses Stories and anyone who is interested can find it on e bay as item number 221376192805. </p><p>The sale price is $5.95 and it will be delivered in 3 formats: EPUB, MOBI and PDF. </p><p>If I sell a few of the books I will do a second one in a couple of months. </p><p>The listing is up for 30 days and I will renew it for another month after that. </p><p>It is a fixed price auction and you can pay with paypal. I will e mail the formats to you once Pay pal notifies me that the payment has been received.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>A. P.</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2013, 21:26</p><p>Moonshiner: </p><p>    Yes, I think your solution concerning Youtube videos would be a tolerable one if Gus and others persist with the spam and make it necessary.  Posting (without the link) the exact title of the video we wish to share, along with a succinct description of the video's subject matter, shouldn't be too difficult for us longtime Eyescene contributors to handle.  I have shared many Youtube videos here over the years..... usually on the "Musicians" and "Actresses" threads.  I'm certainly willing to go along with your plan without complaint if you deem it unavoidable. </p><p>    A.P.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2013, 19:21</p><p>I've just looked at Bobby's blog (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815103109/http://bobbylaurel.blogspot.cz/)" target="_blank">http://bobbylaurel.blogspot.cz/)</a> for the first time in ages and I was delighted to find that he's uploaded twenty or so more of the stories that were on his other site. </p><p>Thanks Bobby, keep up the good work, and above all have a good new year in 2014!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Moonshiner</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2013, 03:18</p><p>I deleted some spam and blocked an IP address in San Francisco. I may have to block Youtube links to stop the spam, If I do, any one wanting to show a video from Youtube can put the title of the video in the post (copy and paste) and viewers can go to Youtube and find it by searching for the title.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Val</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2013, 06:22</p><p>As the administrator of Vision And Spex, I can say is simple for me to block users or IP addresses. I did it at least ten times before. And I will do it again, when necessary. </p><p>I am not a computer engineer, the software is free for use, available on the internet. But using the server, and parking the domain vision-and-spex.com it's not free. </p><p>Like Moonshiner does for Eyescene, I pay for the site from my own pocket. It's not much. But it's not free for me. Everybody is welcome without any costs. If you only want to read the posts, you can come as guest. No need for user or password.  </p><p>Only if you want to post a message, you will need to register. </p><p>The important thing is that Eyescene still lives. One way or another...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>EyeTri</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2013, 13:47</p><p>I tend to agree with Trent. To me, the postings of Gus and others like him are minor nuisance and I don't think that's enough reason to change EyeScene.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>A. P.</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2013, 11:58</p><p>Trent:  your comment was perfectly stated.  Amen.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Juicebox</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2013, 11:38</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p> </p><p>Ahh I haven't used that website, though I think I've seen it mentioned on here. I'd be all up for doing something like that. I do agree with Trent though that registration would likely deter newcomers. Cactus Jack and yourself, amongst others, are extremely helpful to people who don't regularly use the site (as well as those that do) and it would be a shame for people to no longer have easy access to that information.. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Trent</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2013, 22:09</p><p>I disagree with having a username and pw, it would deter new people from coming to the site and stifle growth.  I love the open nature of Eye Scene, lets keep it the way it is.  Just continue to delete spam from gus and others and don't let them get under your skin.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2013, 20:49</p><p>Juicebox </p><p>I would think it could be as simple as the "Vision and specs" site. All that was needed there was an email address and username as I recall. like you I don't care that anyone knows my actual name is Jim.  </p><p>It's really a shame that it even needs to be done but if that will keep the crack pots out then its worth it.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2013, 19:42</p><p>Oh come on; registration needn't involve more than a username and a password.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Juicebox</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2013, 16:12</p><p>Just adding my 2 pence (I'm from the UK), for me, it would depend on the depth to which the registration went into. I wouldn't really feel too comfortable giving away my location or my full name, not because I don't trust people on here, but because there are some weirdos out there and once something is on the Internet, it is there forever no matter how careful people holding the information are. However, I would be more than happy to give my email address and if it meant I could keep using the site, my first name. Its been so great having people to talk to and get support from on here and I wouldn't want it to disappear purely because some people have too much spare time on their hands and take so much pleasure from other people's frustrations (I'm part German and we have a lovely word for it that you may have heard: schadenfreude). Maybe jumping ship before we hit the iceberg here in the sense that I have no idea if the moderator would even consider registration, but just though I'd share my feelings on the sitch.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>A. P.</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2013, 13:50</p><p>If registration were to be imposed, it might keep out the "riff raff"......  or it might not.  </p><p>What registration certainly would do is keep out some longtime contributors to this site who simply prefer to maintain their anonymity.  I've made plenty of tasteful contributions to Eyescene over the past several years, but I will not register under any circumstances.  I believe there must be other regulars here who share my view. </p><p>Do we really need to let a few bad apples (most notably that Gus/Ralph guy) to restrict this great site for the rest of us? Just my two cents worth.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2013, 07:58</p><p>I also agree that registration may just have to be the way to go.  Sure it may take a little time at the beginning, but if it keeps out the riff-raff, it's worth it.  And it would be great to have an avatar available so I can show a lot of many of my pretty cat's-eyes.  :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2013, 03:52</p><p>S4E and astigmaphile: I agree with you. Some of the old-timers here will remember that between 1999 and 2001 EyeScene appeared in a format that included registration for members but still allowed visitors to post, with some restrictions on what they could do. That seemed to work OK. You may be able to check this out on the archive Bobby set up - check the front page.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;25 Dec 2013, 15:56</p><p>I agree with specs4ever. I am registered at vision-and-spex.com and would be more than happy to do so here.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;25 Dec 2013, 09:46</p><p>Despite your best efforts Moonshiner, what with public WiFi hotpots all over the place as well as programs that mask the users IP address you will never be able to get rid of all the posers such as Gus. </p><p>When Wurm announced that he was closing this site and Val started up the other site that required registration I was quite happy because I figured that with registration most of the problems would be eliminated. </p><p>You have done the best you can to keep this site going and for that we thank you.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2013, 09:18</p><p>S4E: maybe you ought to do that. It is such a shame that Bobby's site is kaputt; but besides that there has been nothing posted on his blog since 10 April. However: does everybody know that although his old site is out of commission all the stories on it can still be reached? For details see Erik's May post on Vision &amp; Spex: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815103109/http://www.vision-and-spex.com/bobby-s-sites-t334.html" target="_blank">http://www.vision-and-spex.com/bobby-s-sites-t334.html</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2013, 07:12</p><p>One of my oldest friends from the early days of Eyescene has proposed setting up a site where all my stories can be posted. He has even sent me a mock up of it.  I do not know the ins and outs of web sites, and the one time I tried my own site was a disaster because I couldn't post the stories myself.  If we can work out the logistics so that I can do the posting of the stories myself I am seriously considering doing this. </p><p>This way people who do not like my stories will not have to read them. </p><p>Thanks to everyone who responded favorably towards my work. I have said before that for the most part I write a story for my own pleasure. But I also have to admit that being able to post the story for others to read does help drive me to write another new one.  Having no outlet for them has resulted in me only completing one story over the summer. So the idea of a place to post them has had my head spinning with ideas.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Storyreader</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2013, 03:49</p><p>Specs4ever: I appreciate your stories and I know I'm not the only one. Why not post them on V&amp;A; for now and see if anyone comes up with a more comprehensive site like Bobby's used to be?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2013, 00:34</p><p>S4E - I'm with Anon, your stories are greatly appreciated as is seen by the comments every time you post a story.  </p><p> </p><p>If this Baroosa person is such a great connoisseur of and top critic of great stories I'm sitting here wondering where his fantastic stories are that he is using to compare to yours.  Gosh, I've looked everywhere and I can't seem to find any.  Hmm, I also don't recall ever seeing posts from this person either, so speaking for one who has been around for a while, (and posts occasionally when he sees a need to) I think I speak for at least a large number of and perhaps the majority of the REGULARS on this site that we would love for you to keep posting your stories. </p><p> </p><p>Looking forward to the next story, I am </p><p> </p><p>Specs4Me</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anon</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2013, 19:45</p><p>Hey Specs4ever, I can assure you that I believe Barossa is very much in the minority. I love reading all your stories and read the older ones over and over again. </p><p> </p><p>Please continue to contibute.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2013, 19:22</p><p>Borrosa, the thing about Roger Ebert is that when he criticized a movie he usually offered suggestions about how it could be better. Your post offers nothing of the sort and is just rude sniping, so you shouldn't be surprised by the response you got.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2013, 16:20</p><p>Not much makes me angry, these days, but Borrossa's posting, and others like it, come close.  You would note he (surely not a she?) does not himself offer to contribute a story.  He airily implies there are lots of people out there who will happily contribute 'better' stories, but the only thing preventing them is that the current crop of writers are hogging the sites. </p><p>In addition to obvious rudeness, his posting thus combines arrogance and a complete lack of reality. I have toyed with writing some examples of the genre myself.  The experience has taught me that writing good stories requires creativity and imagination combined with the discipline and effort to get it into text and edit it.  There are two reasons I haven't tried to post any of my efforts.  Firstly I haven't yet completed the work to edit any of them to a level I'm happy with (and I'm far from being a perfectionist).  And secondly I'm all too aware how poor my efforts are in comparison to those of Specs4ever and others who have contributed many EXCELLENT stories over the years.  In a number of my efforts the plot simply runs into the sand and the story is never finished.  Maybe others have the same problem. </p><p>I assure Specs4ever that I for one miss his stories and urge him to publish his backlog however he can.  I am sure we all wish Bobby success in overcoming whatever difficulties he is facing in getting his site back up. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2013, 14:13</p><p>I don't see any problem with someone new writing a story. If you believe you have something new or interesting to say, do it.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2013, 14:07</p><p>Well well, if Borrosa's opinion is in the majority here there certainly isn't much incentive for me to ever post another story</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2013, 11:35</p><p>Isn't that like telliing Roger Ebert to go win an Oscar if he dares to criticzes a film?  Or telling someone who critcize football team to go see if you can win the Superbowl?     </p><p> </p><p>Oh so I guess we are now only allowed to criticize something if we can do it better?  Good luck convincing all the sports critics, movie critics, book critics, etc. of your demand on them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Asorrob</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2013, 09:16</p><p>Then let's see what you have to offer, Herr Critic!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Borrosa</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2013, 08:08</p><p>I think we need to face the reality we need BETTER writers than the current self-appointed authors.  It would do the community much more justice if the current crop just stepped aside and gave up. </p><p> </p><p>I know this sounds like I am being harsh, but in the same way a critic reviews a book on the Times Bestseller List, I'm giving my opinion that the stories I've seen here and on V&amp;S; just plain stink.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2013, 09:36</p><p>Writing and editing a good story is hard, time consuming, work,  I recently wrote a story "The Strabismus Institute" and posted it in parts on the Vision &amp; Specs site.  In my naiveté I posted the parts with little review and editing (as kindly suggested by S4E) and the story has internal inconsistencies and an unsatisfying ending.  I intend to re-write the story because I think I can do better.  Everyone has to start somewhere and often our first efforts leave something to be desired.   </p><p>A friend who has a reputation as an excellent amateur photographer told me his secret a few years ago. "Take lots and lots of pictures, but sort them carefully.  Never, never, never let anyone else see your bad ones.  Five or ten really good pictures are vastly better to show the neighbors than a hundred or so random pictures of nothing interesting to anyone but your immediate family. </p><p>Before complaining too much, try writing a story yourself.  Unfortunately, because of the uniqueness of our typical stories, it is hard to find an understanding friend to read and comment.  A poor second choice is to, as S4E suggested, put the story away for a while and then go back and edit it yourself before you publish it.  A third choice is to go ahead and post your story, face your critics with a smile,  learn and try again.  Practice makes perfect. </p><p>In a perfect world, I would likely ask Val to delete my story, but while the story is not the best I think I can do, it might be better than nothing for desperate OOs in the midst of a story drought.  I find summer is not a very good time to write or edit.  Sometimes you just want to actually and figuratively, Chill Out. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2013, 07:27</p><p>My first reaction was "does this deserve an answer." But I guess it does. While I am not as enamored by the community as I once was we are still all people with a common interest and I don't have any axe to grind. </p><p>I write my stories first for my own enjoyment.  I probably write a story a year ahead of putting it out on the web, and over that year I read it and revise it again and again, until I reach a point where I feel I can do nothing more with it. When it does go out, I want others to enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed writing it. </p><p>But I don't like the fact that the only outlet now available for my story can mean that a story that I have spent a lot of time on can immediately be buried by another story.  I used to like Bobby's site a lot, because I had my own section. But it is no longer available to anyone. </p><p>As a result I am sitting on a lot of stories. With no home for them I have pretty much quit writing new ones.  So as a result it seems that I have again retired. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;02 May 2013, 04:57</p><p>Ellie, </p><p> </p><p>there is a fair chance that the Rob who wrote the story about the extremely shortsighted princess will write more stories about our theme on Eye Scene. He wrote the story after seeing a number of portraits from my photo shoot with Melissa, a gorgeous freelance model here in Holland. His idea was that I could capture the story in either a video or a series of photos. Nothing came out of it but we are now considering to do it the other way round: he may well be able to write a good story based upon a new photo shoot with a bit of a theme to it. A part of a recent photo shoot in Ireland may serve as vehicle. He is an excellent writer and I look forward to a future cooperation with him. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2013, 15:23</p><p>Asdoo, </p><p>I owe you an apology.  It was Likelenses that wanted to add or subtract 180 degrees from the axis when changing from + cylinder to - cylinder.  Adding or subtracting 180 degrees would not change the axis at all. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2013, 06:30</p><p>It's mighty dangerous on the sidewalks this morning from the freezing rain that fortunately was not on the roads or in the parking lot, but I made it into work, and while waiting for the Admin server to warm up so I could program my fabulous web apps, I looked up my RX on the previous posts. </p><p> </p><p>I could not remember the axis number, but here is the official RX: </p><p> </p><p>-9.00 +3.00 90 (add +2.50).   </p><p> </p><p>Maybe the optical place changes it to the -6.00/-3.00, because I never pay extra for prescriptions over + or - 8.00.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Asdoo</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2013, 02:36</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p>I understand how to convert plus cylinder to minus cylinder. Melyssa posted her complete prescription a few years ago. I remember the sphere and cylinder, but I don't remember the axis. I know that you have to add 90 to the axis if it is below 90 and subtract 90 if the axis is above 90. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2013, 23:24</p><p>Likelenses, </p><p>Many, but not all Ophthalmologists write + cylinder and a few optometrists and opticians write + cylinder, but most don't.  Lens makers always make glasses with - cylinder because they grind the cylinder correction into the back surface of the lens with rare exceptions. </p><p>The conversion procedure for changing a prescription from + cylinder to - cylinder is to: </p><p>1. Algebraically add the cylinder to the sphere.  -9.00 +(+3.00) = -6.00 </p><p>2. Change the sign on the cylinder. +3.00 becomes -3.00 </p><p>3. Add or subtract 90 degrees to/from the axis so that it falls between 0 and 179 degrees (or 1 and 180 degrees).  By tradition, the 0/180 axis is horizontal and the 90 degree axis is vertical.  The degree numbers increase counter clockwise looking at the patient. </p><p>Last time I checked there are only 360 degrees in a circle and the 0/180 axis is the same horizontal orientation of the long axis as the cylinder and 90 and 270 would also be the same axis, but again by tradition axis only numbers between 0 and 179 should be used as the axis numbers, but I have seen prescriptions with the axis shown as 180 degrees, which is the same axis as 0.  </p><p>Both you and Asdoo made mistakes in the conversion procedure. </p><p>BTW the above procedure also will convert - cylinder to + cylinder.  Example:  -6.00, -3.00 x 90 would convert to -6.00 + (-3.00) = -9.00 so the + cylinder Rx would be: -9.00, +3.00 x 0, but I can't imagine why anyone would want to do it. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2013, 21:12</p><p>Asdoo </p><p> I forgot to say that the power of the sphere never changes.only the axis of the cyl.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2013, 21:09</p><p>Asdoo </p><p> I believe that her glasses would be made up by the optician as -9.00 -3.00 CYL and the axis would be changed 180 degrees from how it was written as a plus cyl. </p><p> An astigmatism correction written by an ophthalmologist is always written as a plus cyl. and converted by the optician to a minus.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Asdoo</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2013, 00:47</p><p>Likelenses </p><p>Her prescription is sph -9.00 cyl+3.00. If it was converted to minus cylinder it would be sph -6.00 cyl -3.00. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2013, 22:36</p><p>Revolver </p><p> I had the very same thought. </p><p> However as I recall her prescription is -9.0 with some astigmatism, which make it all the better.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2013, 08:20</p><p>Melyssa:  have you seen those ginormous drop temples listed on the Glasses for Auction or Sale thread?  The very thought of those with your -6.00 sph and -3.00 lenses in them, especially in CR-39, is too delicious to contemplate.  IMHO those are the best ever listed on that thread and there have been some great ones.  </p><p></p><hr>

The biggest problem I have is that it makes no sense for someone to come into a forum with the only purpose of being arguemental and insulting. Let me ask you something, if you lets say belonged to a chat room about dresses and you and many others posted various pictures of all styles of dresses and out of nowhere a certain "no name" person suddenly came around and started insulting the taste of you and others about the dresses and of course they never bothered EVER putting anything in would you not quickly see that they were only there to create trouble for everyone? Don't tell me you wouldn't be pissed. Again just be honest with us it's glasses but maybe for you it is something else. If the thing you had an interest in was constantly being attacked would you like it. So yes they have a right to be here, but a better question is why are they here?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Owlish</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2012, 20:32</p><p>Sherry; to my knowledge you are not one of our "longtime users with known names"... have you ever contributed so much as a link? ... and yet, oddly, you have taken it upon yourself to defend such anonymous garbage as this: </p><p> </p><p>" 08 Oct 2012, 16:15 </p><p> </p><p>olek please stop posting ugly women" </p><p> </p><p>It's becoming more obvious, I think, that you and the anons are one and the same troll.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sherry</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2012, 16:04</p><p>RXologist, I would have to say think again.  From my own viewpoint, I think that some of the strongest negativity seems to have come from longtime users with known names attacking the so called anonymous posts. </p><p> </p><p>Remember flame wars can't happen unless there are two sides fighting.  And I have seen some vicious attacks from people I thought I respected here.   </p><p> </p><p>I know this is not sounding great, but I am being open about my comments.  I believe that is what you want.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RXologist</b>&nbsp;07 Oct 2012, 15:24</p><p>The main problem with the anonymous remarks, especially those negative ones which are very arrogant, is that it's easy to mistake them as expressing the common view of Eyescene users.  </p><p>Unfortunately, some users get intimidated when they read them, much more than they would from reading negative remarks from a known user (who almost never post such remarks anyway). </p><p>This is probably just one rather cowardly and troubled individual (most remarks are exactly the same in tone and grammar), but IMO he or she makes a lot of damage.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>benn</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2012, 16:26</p><p>I have been here since the start and while I don't post often, this the best site on the web. </p><p> </p><p>What is the issue of having "pretend" comments.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2012, 11:35</p><p>Well I certainly would have no problem with that concept. But as you know it won't stop someone from making comments that are unwanted.

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2012, 11:30</p><p>I agree with RXologist 200%.  As a computer programmer, I know about making people put in certain information to access more than just the front page of a website application.  Also, "visionandspex.com" requires a user ID and password, which is probably why there has been far less activity there than at Eyescene.  Remember, Lenschat was once a "Come one, come all, no ID required" site.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RXologist</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2012, 10:27</p><p>I've been pondering this for a while: I think it is time to introduce usernames and require users to login to Eyescene - to ensure normal standards of conversation (non users would only be able to read the threads, not post anything).  </p><p> </p><p>The net is constantly evolving, we can't keep a stasis here, especially as it seems that a new generation and new kind of users have joined this forum. Most seasoned respected users keep a single username anyway. </p><p> </p><p>The main aim would be to prevent these aggressive belligerent anonymous postings that have plagued this forum lately and intimidate potential posters.It might be just one rogue user, be he/she makes enough damage to justify some preventive measures (and deleting the posts afterwards solves nothing). </p><p> </p><p>This is how I feel, hopefully this won't be a difficult change to implement.

<p><b>Sherry</b>&nbsp;02 Oct 2012, 06:38</p><p>I have to agree that the same sex relationship is really being played up far too much, and that is probably why it is starting to appear ficitious.  This site is supposed to be about glasses, not about whom you sleep with.  I don't talk about my lovers here either. </p><p> </p><p>But you must agree that while it is easy to skip over Carrie's posts if you don't like them, it's just as easy to skip over the posts that criticize them too.  Both sides deserve an equal voice in this debate.  You say you should not be censored, but I also say neither should they.  Everyone has a right to say as they feel about this, yet unfortunately their side is the only one that keeps being deleted.</p><p></p><hr>

When you see the name "Carrie" or any other person that you deem unworthy to be in here can't you just skip over it and go to the next comment? This constant bickering is becoming much more of a problem than anything Carrie has to say. Moonshiner has stated his position on this matter and since he was the only one to come forward a year ago when no one else wanted the job of being the in charge I really think it unwise to contridict his decision.  </p><p>Not to mention after reading her comment again she clearly is responding to a question asked of her by Soundmanpt and it is in fact concerning glasses as I read it.  </p><p>Let's stop being so self rightous and worry about adding things of value to this site instead of worrying about someone that it seems you have an ax to grind with.

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2012, 18:10</p><p>Thanks for the support everyone. Much appreciated. Yes, it did happen in the UK. I had a little cry myself when my girlfriend was having a snooze yesterday afternoon so she didn't see me and get even more upset. I was upset by the incident but I was more upset by seeing my girlfriend so scared and crying so much she couldn't speak. Thankfully 99.9% of the time we are accepted for who we are and even if people don't approve of same sex relationships they keep their feelings to themselves. We occasionally get funny looks and muttered comments but we ignore them. We also get people saying things like "Oh, you're young. It's just a phase you'll grow out of." For some young people it may well be a "phase", but it's not a phase for us. My girlfriend has never fancied boys. When she was about 11 or 12 she tried to make herself fancy them to be like other girls but it didn't work. I still fancy boys/men but I fancy girls/women too (I'd say 60-40 preference for women to men). I'm not experimenting. I'm not confused. We love each other deeply as well as being sexually attracted to each other. I've felt better inside ever since I stopped denying to myself that I had sexual feelings for women. That then led to me realising I had a thing for women wearing glasses. My girlfriend does not know about this, though. Maybe I will tell her one day. Not just yet. Oh yeah, another very annoying comment is "Which one of you is the man in the relationship?" For f***s sake we fancy each other because we are both very feminine girls. Neither of us is butch or looks butch. If I wanted someone butch I'd have stayed with my boyfriend! My girlfriend is more emotional than me but other than that we're as girly as each other. Not a stereotype lesbian couple.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2012, 17:49</p><p>Carrie, </p><p> </p><p>this could have happened to anyone who looks different from the (well below) average. It's a pity that not the bonobos but the chimps are closest to us. Aggression instead of the "love and peace bit". Civilisation is but a thin layer of varnish.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2012, 17:23</p><p>Carrie </p><p> </p><p>I also think sometimes the best response is no response. That is what I am sure they were trying to lure you into was some kind of comment back. The way you reacted in my mind was perfect. They don't know how much it upset you and your gf and were probably disappointed that they failed to provoke you.  </p><p>They only showed how ignorant they are and maybe at least one of them may have even thought so as well. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2012, 13:35</p><p>You were wise, Carrie, not to answer back.  I can imagine how frightening this must have felt, but my instinct is that a mixed group would have been unlikely to physically attack two ladies. </p><p>I do think you should not take it personally.  You could just as easily have been picked on for the colour of your skin, or for being fat or thin, or for some other distinguishing feature.  They're not worth getting upset about. </p><p>Can I ask where this took place?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Octopuss</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2012, 06:09</p><p>Carrie </p><p> </p><p>These people are morons, Was it in the UK?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2012, 06:01</p><p>Sorry this isn't really glasses related but more of a rant! </p><p>I was out with my girlfriend last night planning to go for a pizza and meet friends in a pub later. It wasn't late, probably 8ish. A group of about 6 men and women probably only a few years older than us came towards us. We tried to walk around them but the deliberatley got in our way. I felt my girlfriend squeeze my hand in a slightly nervous way. The group didn't physically touch us but just got very close and came out with various insults and offensive comments about lesbians, us wearing glasses and even the clothes we were wearing. Very intimidating and frightening. I was tempted to answer back but thought better of it in case it made things worse. They then just walked off laughing. By this time my girlfriend had nearly crushed my hand with hers. I realised she had tears in her eyes so I hugged her and she began to cry. The whole encounter brought back horrible memories for her from school when she had been teased a lot for being gay and had actually been beaten up a few times too. I didn't know her very well at the time and didn't even know that anyone at school had been beaten up for being gay!  </p><p>We decided that we wouldn't stay out and went back to her house. I phoned the friends we were going to meet up with and told them what happened and that we wouldn't be meeting up with them. A short time later they turned up with some wine and a couple of pizzas to try and cheer us up. It was a really nice gesture and did cheer us both up but in the back of my mind I couldn't help thinking how the incident in town could have easily turned nasty. I was scared but my poor girlfriend was absolutely terrified. </p><p>My girlfriend didn't sleep at all last night and I probably only slept for a couple of hours in total. </p><p>I just can't believe that even in the 21st century same sex couples are still getting abuse! We're not hurting anyone. We're just 2 people who love each other, just like any other couple. We're not going round trying to turn straight people gay! My girlfriend didn't turn me gay, she just made me realise I am attracted to women and I should stop telling myself I'm not. School kids can be very nasty to each other especially if they've been brainwashed by their parents into hating gay people. Even though it was over 5 years since my girlfriend was beten up at school she won't tell me or anyone else who did it as she is still scared of them (and scared of what I might do to them!). </p><p>It is such a shame that f***wits like the ones we were unfortunate enough to meet are still around. They probably won't even remember doing it but me and my girlfriend will remember it for a long time. Some people might say we shouldn't take it personally. Well we do take it personally and that verbal attack on us was personal. Despite that we are not going to stop going out in public or showing affection to each other in public the way that straight couples do. </p><p>Sorry this went on for so long but I needed to say it in writing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2012, 11:13</p><p>Carrie: </p><p> </p><p>Glad to hear you liked the story, and happy to see you are back on ES, had invited your comments in an earlier post, then found out you couldn't get in to ES. </p><p> </p><p>No, there was no double entendre in "right up your alley" and in fact, had to read your post twice until I figured out what you were talking about and the "I got it" and the light bulb came on over my head.

Activity only requires consent where some sort of contact occurs. You dont get to decide why other people might fancy you in short and if you dont like the idea that they might - dont post your pictures on the internet (though equally you would have to avoid going into public places as people might find you attractive there too).</p><p></p><hr>

In retrospect, my reaction was based on the fact that I never posted anything "second hand", so to speak. Everything I am posting on my weblog is new material, with explicit consent by the models who pose for me. I tell the models that their pictures will be posted on my weblog, in other words, they are presented to the world pretty much the same way the French government released the patent to Daguerrotype photography to the world back in 1839. All I am asking is that people wishing to use pictures from my work is a reference to the original source, in other words, not pretending it was their own work. I am grateful to Eye Scene members who informed me that pictures were used without any reference and in most cases, the problem was solved without any problem. I am aware that many links posted here on the "Seen on the web" link are second hand. Some links are really beautiful but I leave it to the ethics of those who post them and I hope that they will follow the same code that I follow with my models. Perhaps naive but so be it. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;11 Apr 2012, 17:11</p><p>Au contraire, Crystal Veil, it could be shown that a number of people have gotten very upset through this forum but the term "hurt" is subjective.  let's think about the many times that someone has asked that we remove the link to their photographs because they felt "creeped out" by the presence of our visitors on their site.  we've even had our own membership here repeatedly warn the Eyescene community to be careful about the remarks that our population has placed on the linked websites.  Were the original photograph owners "hurt" by this attention?  Emotionally perhaps.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Over_16s_only_please</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2012, 16:55</p><p>I agree with many others on here who have queried the appearance of pictures of minors on the site. </p><p> </p><p>My preference would be for no pictures under the age of 16 to be posted on this site and if they are they should be removed. The girl on vision-and-spex is 16 and she posted the pics herself. That's a massive difference compared to a person younger than that who finds her pics have been lifted from somewhere else without her knowledge and permission and appear on a site to gratify the sexual fetishes of Eyescene users.  </p><p> </p><p>Let me stress: it's not the glasses fetish I'm concerned about. All of us have particular sexual preferences. Where I am worried is the crossover between a generally harmless fetish and the potential abuse of a person who is under the age of sexual consent.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Concern about Future Eyescene</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2012, 16:23</p><p>There clearly are differing views on the purpose of Eyescene and it's contributors.  But it is critical we hash this out for many reasons.   </p><p> </p><p>If indeed this were a simple discussion site about eyewear, why would all the people below have posted such strong personal objections to pictures of minors being included here?  I believe it is because they "get it."  They see the bigger picture, see through all the smoke and mirrors, that Eyescene is truly a fetish site for people with a sexual interest in glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Now if you were to read most of the forums, you would probably be confused and argue that you don't see where all the sexual "stuff" actually is located.  It isn't as obvious, until you start to read many comments from people who have posted over the years where they cite the simple discussion of eyes, glasses, vision, etc as a topic is something they find sexually stimulating as well.  Many comments have also been posted over the years about how contributors here try to "overhear" such conversations between people, or secretly spy them, or photograph them without their knowledge, because everything about this fetish is a major turn on to them. </p><p> </p><p>Those comments put what appears to be normal conversation over eyewear on this site a whole different light. </p><p> </p><p>Furthering my point, I would argue how many people here keep the bookmark of this site private.  Or have ever even shared with their coworkers, spouses, or significant others, the content of this site.  If it truly were an open discussion about eyewear, what would be the problem?  How would you feel if your coworker, spouse, or significant other visited this site and browsed through the content to their leisure.

<p><b>Gen chan</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2012, 14:20</p><p>I don't often feel compiled to post to this site, although I have been a visiter of here for a very long time. Actually I've been a visitor ever sense I was a minor myself. After going back and looking at the picture that has caused all the offence though, quite frankly I find the whole mess rather amusing. </p><p> </p><p>The way I've always seen it. Eyescene is and has always been like in it's title, a discussion site. As such as well people of all ages has been allowed to post on or view it as well. Of course there are topics here that go into the fetish side as well and even in threads like like when I was at school people can be describing about how they fancied minors. Of course with there it's saying about that from the point of view of being a minor as well. but is that wrong. </p><p> </p><p>Also for my feelings about it being a discussion site, a good part of the site is to do with people talking about their eyesight or asking questions because they may not understand things well. From that you've got normal adults posting, right up to parents asking about their kids, to the kids, the minors so well. If this is a fetish site as some are implying, are you saying that such discussions are sexual in nature as well and don't belong on the site also? </p><p> </p><p>This actually reminds me of something from the vision-and-spex site that a schoolgirl posted. She was talking about stuff that was going on with her vision and even posted pictures of herself when she got new glasses. I would guess under what you are trying to imply, she shouldn't be allowed to do that here, yet over there the discussion continued and didn't stray from topic and going into the sexual side. That site there has the same role as this one, to replace Wurm's Eyescene. Are the 2 places really that different when a lot of the topics, themes and even members are the same. </p><p> </p><p>As for the picture itself. I implied that I came here as a minor and back then and I'm not scared to say this, I would have liked seeing a picture like that. Someone around the same age as me as apposed to the older women more common. But I'm not a minor now, I'm a man in my mid 20's. However I will look through at that picture and not feel offended. I can go through all of Seen on the web and Guys with glasses and feel the same way. I like looking at glasses and seeing what sort of frames they have or how the lenses are, but it is not sexual in nature that I enjoy such things. If I want that, there are the XXX links and other sites to go to and will please me in that way instead. If permission to such pictures or videos isn't granted then they should be removed, but in the context of the page and with the q&amp;a; on the site, the picture is in context and justified.  </p><p> </p><p>Maybe you might agree with what I'm saying and maybe your don't, but I think it's important here and sometimes to stop looking at the world through your pervert goggles and start looking at the bigger picture bound your own needs. </p><p> </p><p>So, what should be done with this site then? It could carry on, follow it's rules and be careful from now on like it has been doing over the many years that I've known this place. In short, it should stay being a discussion site. However, if this place is a fetish site after all and end of story, there is a much bigger problem going on then just a random picture of a teenage girl. If that is the case, it's more then just pictures that need to be removed, but discussions and topics that would need to go as well. As a result of it as well and to prevent such appearing, access to the site should be blocked as well to minors. If it's an adult site, then it would only be natural and right to treat it as such. I don't think that's what people would want though.  </p><p> </p><p>End of the day, the context of what's posted is as important as the context or the person reading it. They aren't always the same and it can cause issues like this. But as long as things are clear and balanced, I don't see any reason why this should cause the fuss that it has. Also as a personal note, if I saw this site like some are implying, as a fetish or adult site, then my interest in here would have been nothing like what it has been.  Why would I visit something that isn't interesting after all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2012, 13:33</p><p>to be honest, not only as a minor but even as an _adult_ woman who wears glasses i definitely dont't want my pictures being linked into the 'sexual arousal' context of the seen-on-the-web thread when i have them published elsewhere on the internet in a completety fetish-free context. it's just wrong to do this change of context without asking for explicit permission, especially as nowadays every future boss searchs the internet before actually hiring you. just my 2ct.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2012, 09:58</p><p>i think it might be a good idea to consider what we all talk about on this site.  we don't go on about trendiness, we have topics like "what turns you on about glasses" and "XXX links" and "seen on the web" and "sightings."  all these talk topics talk about what excites and attracts us to this sexual fetish.  an outside eye would not understand anything here and it might appear to be a normal eyewear discussion site, just like the leather and rubber sites might seem the same way.  but who are we trying to kid.  this site isn't for the outside eye, its for us and we know what the images are here for, and that's the important part. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2012, 09:49</p><p>mmm, it's all very well stating what the intention of this site is. But perhaps instead just look at the content and draw conclusions solely from that.

<p><b>Curious About Future Eyescene</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2012, 06:59</p><p>Moonshiner... If you will pardon, one additional comment I wanted to make.  You seem to identify this site as an eyewear site first and a sexual fetish site secondly.  As someone who has been around since the USENET days which generated successive sites, including this one, it is indeed a sexual site first. </p><p> </p><p>But you could argue that eyewear and glasses are discussed in a manner that is not sexually associated with the items.  For that same argument, I would ask you to look on leather fetish sites, and you will see whole discussions about the use of leather, the quality of leather, which leather feels better than the rest, and even tanning techniques to get the best leather.   </p><p> </p><p>The same thing goes to sites for people who have a strong sexual interest in rubber, nylons, even prosthetic limbs.  There is always a strong discussion of the item itself. </p><p> </p><p>But you won't see Wilson's Leather linking to that leather sexual fetish site.  And you won't see Goodyear linking to that rubber sexual fetish site.  Why?  Because as they know, a deep sexual attraction to something generates much discussion of the items associated with that sexual attraction, but not in a manner that the rest of the public would understand. </p><p> </p><p>So for those reasons, I argue that Eyescene has been, and will always be a sexual fetish website first and foremost.  You don't see Pearle Vision Optical posting a link to your site, do you?  How about ForEyes?  Nope.

You basically agreed that photographs showing minors do not belong on this site without realizing you said so.  Here's your quote: "any discussion of, or links to material which portrays, pre-adolescents in sexual situations will be deleted." </p><p> </p><p>Now let's take that in the normal world context.  That means any naked children, showing body parts, in an exploitative manner intended for the sexual gratification of others.  Of course, that is most obvious and should not be allowed. </p><p> </p><p>But here's the problem.  The people who visit this site do not generally derive sexual stimulation from the normal world.  This site is dedicated to those who find a sexual attraction to eyeglass wearers, or those who need eyeglasses.  In that context, the things that derive sexual satisfaction from, such as someone getting new glasses, cleaning their glasses, squinting, talking about how bad their eyesight is, etc would not generally be taken by the normal world as anything of sexual interest to them. </p><p> </p><p>But all those things do generate sexual arousal here.  The photograph links that are presented are because someone has found a link providing and we are sharing those links due to the sexual arousal they provide to people with our fetish.  We know the outside world does not view these things as sexual, yet we feel comfortable talking and sharing links here, because we derive sexual satisfaction from the non-normal methods that your FAQ presents. </p><p> </p><p>So getting back to the pictures.  Most of the links here (apart from the XXX) would be thrown off pornographic sites because they wouldn't understand where the stimulation comes in.  However, as our fetish is non-normal, the normal world would not see how we are deriving sexual satisfaction from these links. </p><p> </p><p>But in fact they are.  When we click on these links, we are expecting to derive sexual arousal from these links because they are targeted to our specific fetish here.  Normal world folks would snooze at what we find so sexually attractive. </p><p> </p><p>In that context, let's consider why links are being posted here, as stated above.  For the sexual satisfaction of the users of this site.  Now we are seeing links for children being posted because they are doing something which the site population here would deem sexually stimulating if an adult were doing the same thing. </p><p> </p><p>So in that context, understanding all of the above, are the links of children being posted here to generate sexual stimulation because of their glasses wearing?  While the normal world would not understand what we find sexually attractive here, we all understand it.  So is the posting of children wearing glasses on this site exploiting the sexual connection to the fetish we have and resulting them being grouped with the adults whom we see doing the same thing sexually exploitative.  YES. </p><p> </p><p>It is sexually exploitative in the manner that asking a six year old to dress up in a negligee and wear adult makeup would be to the normal world.  Posting pictures here of any age of folks engaging in what sexually stimulates us can be considered exploitation. </p><p> </p><p>And in conclusion, it is for those reasons, that I believe you answered the question yourself.  These photo links are being used in a sexually exploitative manner, and I believe in that context - not the normal world context of what the world deems sexually attractive, BUT OUR CONTEXT, you will understand where I come from and continue in that respect, to have them removed.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2012, 13:36</p><p>The irony about all this stuff about internet/communications providers keeping lists of sites we've visited, in order to trap criminals, is that they apparently have many easy ways to bypass them anyway.  </p><p> </p><p>It now seems possible someone in government will realise that this will cost a ton of money to do properly and even so achieve little. For instance, it costs a heap of money just to monitor all those previously identified home-grown terrorists, and that number is nothing compared to the wider population. Not that we have endless money right now. </p><p> </p><p>The strangest thing is that forcing terrorists/criminals off the net does not make them go away. They were around a long time before the internet and mobile phones were invented, and that lack didn't stop them. Possibly someone in government will wake to this truth, rather than pretending doing anything is better than doing nothing. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

It appears that the pictures have been taken off. It's sad to see Pete and others jump off but I can understand their reasoning. I just think it is difficult to police. Moonshiner can't be expected to sit at his computer 24 hours a day and 7 days a week to catch these things as soon as they happen. It would be much better if the person or people just would use common sense and not post them in the first place.  </p><p>Remember if someone came down on this forum because of those pictures I would hate to be the one that posted them as they well could end up doing jail time more so than anyone that simply opened them as we most often have no idea of the age until we open the post.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Concern about Future Eyescene</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2012, 16:28</p><p>Sir..  I still must raise concern.  It's been five days since this has been brought to your attention, and yet the picture of the little 15-year girl wearing glasses remains on this sexually-oriented site.  We all know these pictures are posted for sexual enjoyment and as such, pictures of minors do not have a relevance here. </p><p> </p><p>I ask that you please take action soonest to avoid the spider bots from noting there are links here which lead to children.  This could lead to legal action by authorities who may put this site on a watchlist.  That spells trouble for you, and your users. </p><p> </p><p>If you believe there is an issue with this matter, and it is not in the best interest of the site to remove pictures of minors, why not put it to a vote and ask the readers how they feel about this. </p><p> </p><p>Again, I implore your reconsideration of this matter.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2012, 07:10</p><p>I just think we should all err on the side of caution with the under 18 year olds. They may be posted up with entirely innocent intent, but that might not be clear to others new to this site or its basic concept. </p><p> </p><p>It would be a shame to see this site taken down because people are posting inappropriate material.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Concern about Future Eyescene</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2012, 18:40</p><p>I think the question could be answered quite simply, Crystal Veil.  Ask the parents if they would have any problem with you posting their daughter's pictures on a website that caters to people with a sexual fetish for people who wear glasses.  I think we both know what that answer would be even before you ask it. </p><p> </p><p>If I can add, I think your photographs are more along the lines of artistic value, Crystal Veil.  They are very well done and tastefully nice to look at.  But that doesn't change the nature of this site.  Just take a look at the majority of postings here, particularly in the XXX area.  People are discussing their sexual attraction to glasses, or people who need glasses, and as such how it has become a hobby for them.   </p><p> </p><p>It doesn't need to get extremely graphic but we all know exactly what of feelings are being raised from the pictures being posted here, and it is not art.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2012, 17:54</p><p>Re Concern about the future of Eyescene, </p><p> </p><p>for me this raises the question if I would be putting Eyescene at risk if I did a photo shoot with a slightly under 18 model and send the link to this community. One of my models has a daughter under 18 and she suggested that her daughter might like to do a photo shoot for me in exchange for new glasses as her prescription kept getting worse all the time. The idea did not materialize but I did a photo shoot with a model who was then two months from her 18th birthday. Because of her age I asked her to check if her parents were OK with the shoot as it was my intention to post it on my weblog. The parents saw no harm in it and we did the photo shoot. I also noticed that several Mayhem models are under 18.  </p><p>So my question is: does it make a difference if the person on the photos (and her parents) have approved with posting on the internet or - my guess - the person is unaware that her pictures are posted here? </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Concern about Future Eyescene</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2012, 15:47</p><p>Moonshiner, I must raise another concern as it appears we are back to posting pictures of children. </p><p> </p><p>Please review Olek's posting on 01 Apr 2012, 22:44 in the SEEN ON THE WEB thread.  He clearly notes that this individual is only 15 years old, but in my opinion, that makes it even worse.  Knowingly posting a child's picture on a site which is  clearly designed for a sexual fetish is plain wrong. </p><p> </p><p>I applauded your efforts last time Moonshiner when those postings were removed and I ask that you do so again.  It might even be necessary to ask that posters do their best to ensure the pictures they are posting here are in compliance with US Federal Laws regarding the distribution of children's photos for sexual gratification. </p><p> </p><p>I ask other Eyesceners here to add their comments about this matter as well. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Concern about Future Eyescene</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2012, 11:41</p><p>Moonshiner please take this in the utmost respect.  This post is meant to serve as constructive criticism of your decision to defend the posting of very young children who happen to wear glasses...    </p><p> </p><p>To be blunt up front, no one here cares with what you and Wurm agreed upon.  The majority of posters here still feel those images violate the spirit of Eyescene which is generally meant as a gathering place for folks with a sexual attraction to glasses and those wearing them.  Images are posted which people often collect and may experience sexual pleasure to.  You can't ignore the sexual aspect of our fetish. </p><p> </p><p>Now given that, allowing the posting links of children photos opens this site up to possible Federal scrutiny down the road.  I work in the Washington, DC area and I know investigative agencies in DC who actively look for sites that post links to children's photos for possible criminal investigation.  If you feel comfortable you can defend the photos as "art" or whatever, that's fine.  But I think you need to re-consider all the factors involved here.  Free speech isn't as free as you think, and others who think they are in full compliance are sometimes dragged into court to defend their actions.  Regardless of the outcome, you can guarantee the exposure is not worth it. </p><p> </p><p>I'd invite you to listen to your USERS, and not adhere to some flimsy agreement that you had.  Isn't this site really here for the users anyway, not just you and Wurm?  Think about that.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hansel</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2012, 14:30</p><p>I feel obliged to put up a post;-) </p><p>Like many I am a daily reader of the site, but not a regular poster. Is it not the case that quite a number of posts that appear are from those concerned about their eyesight/the possibility of needing glasses/the concerns about first time wear in fron of their friends. For those people to have some of the "Gang of 6 or 7" who have much technical knowldege can provide that information/reassurance that comes from their great experience, either via training/pofession or through their own interest. </p><p>Ultimately it is the 6 or 7 who keep the site alive and vibrant, which then allows the casuals, like me the opportunity to post when some thing floats the 1.74s</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John S</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2012, 09:44</p><p>First off,  </p><p>I do use my real first name and my last initial, so I disagree with you. </p><p>As far as getting more exposure - The web site does not have the any Meta Keywords in the header portion of the index page coding. That is what the search engines use to find sites when people put in a search term. I would venture to guess that the missing keywords are intentional, but what do I know... </p><p>I could post an example if anyone is interested.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>8</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2012, 09:07</p><p>There you go, now I have a name.  No one here uses real names so asking for something as ridiculous as that offers nothing to move the conversation forward.  But I'll concede with a name just as phony as all the posters names here. </p><p> </p><p>Bringing this back to the original point:  I'd like to see more people on Eyescene so that it can move away from the clique that has developed.  My one contribution won't bring 5, 10, or even 20 people here, so stop asking about my own contributions.  I've already posted many times and have been a longtime reader, so it's not about that.  It's the bigger picture. </p><p> </p><p>What can the "new" Eyescene do to get wider exposure and get more contributors?  We really need fresh blood here instead of the reading posts by the same authors day in and day out.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2012, 19:33</p><p>On behalf of the site, I invite anyone to pick a name (even "noname", if you want) and start talking about glasses.

But of course you are entitled to your opinion. Other than that remark I actually agree with you. It would be great to see more people contribute in here. As I did before I will confess to being one of the 6 or 7 you refer to. I do hope you take notice that I am not afraid to put my name to my comments.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2012, 15:31</p><p>Glad to see the old site brought over by Moonshiner as new, and I offer my sincere thanks for doing so.  But I think just bringing over the same site still also brought the problem with the same several few people mindlessly posting their opinion day in and day out on everything here over and over again.  That turned the old Eyescene into a clique of 6 or 7 people, and I was hoping the new site can find a way to attract new blood.  I'm not saying the contributions by those people aren't good and sometimes helpful additions, it's just very sad to see the same few posters over and over and over again. </p><p> </p><p>I look forward on how we can get the word out to get more folks on this "new" Eyescene.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2012, 13:05</p><p>They are caving on the DNS blocking, so that's good news if you favor a true hyperlinked web that includes user-generated content. The internet is much more than just an alternative channel to television and radio, and it should stay that way. </p><p> </p><p>The essential problem here, as I see it, is that a coalition of large content owners/sellers wants to set up a kind of parallel legal system with its own set of rules and its own interpretations of due process. The exercises they go through on the other end to keep the actual creators of content away from profits are well documented, so this sort of maneuvering is hypocritical at best. </p><p> </p><p>I'm never mollified by those who say "don't worry about these overly broad laws on the books - we won't enforce them in a way that will harm you". It's far better not to have the bad laws to begin with. </p><p> </p><p>One of my senators (Ron Wyden of Oregon) has stated that he plans to filibuster to defeat this. </p><p> </p><p>I'm an independent contractor and my key client is a company that creates and sells software worldwide. Piracy is real problem and in some cases existing laws need to be more rigorously enforced or even given sharper teeth. We need to continue pushing for better compliance from countries that have tended to tolerate piracy. But this is a bad bill that robs sites and internet service providers of their due process rights.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jb</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2011, 01:51</p><p>just to throw in my opinion. What moonshiner is doing is admirable and he should be applauded. V and S is also a great site and i see no reason they cannot co exist. </p><p>Wurm, thanks for all your efforts over the years and enjoy a deserved web retirement</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2011, 14:36</p><p>Just to be clear, I will only be involved with Moonshiner's site as a technical consultant. I don't plan to do any moderation or decision-making there. </p><p> </p><p>Personally, I will probably visit both sites and hopefully post something every so often. </p><p> </p><p>What this band of merry souls becomes in the future is really only limited by the resolve of individuals. It seems to me there is a core of dedicated individuals like Val and Bobby who will make some sort of run of it. Let's not forget that Lenschat has been going as an independent site for years (TC should be included in the above list of doughty souls as well) and nobody complains that the community has fragmented along those lines. </p><p> </p><p>I offered some time ago to pass along my code, Moonshiner took me up on it, so we will also see what happens there. He strikes me as a gentleman and a scholar, so I'm optimistic.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>pete</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2011, 14:30</p><p>We should be grateful to both Val and Moonshiner for stepping forward to maintain websites for our glasses and vision interests.  Not only do we have a new site but now the continuing original one to look forward to as well.  While ES is a known and established entity,  V&amp;S; has the opportunity to uniquely define itself.  Val seems to be getting good support from S4E, Bobby and others.  That will only add to the sites richness and diversity.   </p><p> </p><p>For example, it's awesome that there is a Stories thread (again).  Though Bobby has done the lion's share by hosting submissions on his site, V&amp;S; provides an easy and direct way for anyone so inclined to present their fiction.   </p><p> </p><p>Also, ES has distinct and fixed threads that must be adhered to.  This restriction becomes arbitrary and limiting sometimes when the natural course of a live thread seems to meander and take on its own identity.   V&amp;S; allows a registered user to bring a new and potentially obscure topic to life.  That's huge! </p><p> </p><p>Who knows what else is possible! </p><p> </p><p>Rather than see conflict and topic overlap with these two sites, we should embrace and promote their differences.  Having twice as many OO forums on the web is significant!  . . . an outstanding way to begin a new year!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2011, 12:33</p><p>Not that what I think means anything, but I would not have any problem being a member of both sites. And if I can ever figure out how to post things on Val's will comment there as well. I see where no one has done any wrong's. Has anyone ever considered that even if Wurm didn't have plans on shutting down someone still could have decided to start a new site. Look at it this way for a time it seemed there might not be any site at all after the first of the year and now we will have not one but 2 to view. </p><p>Also there is something to be said about Val's site which has much merit, and that is keeping out the frauds and fakes. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Spexman the original one</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2011, 11:26</p><p>I must say that if this site will continue, I will be more then happy I have more or less been here every day since that day in may 1995 when I first found it. </p><p> </p><p>This is a part of me and I was more then sad when I heard that the klocks was ringing for funeral of this site. </p><p> </p><p>I dont understand the unfriendly comments from other people that have been along for a long time now. We should be happy ! Very happy to be honnest </p><p> </p><p>IÂ´m relieved that someone is willing to sacrifice time to keep the show going on.  I have also been thinking myself to take contact and trying to help to keep ES alive, but I have both lack of time and knowledge to run it.  So that a solusion comes up eleven fifty-five is making at least me very happy and I also suppose most of the others around here is. </p><p> </p><p>So please no backfire here now because of the resent posts.  I also hope that the new site can survive it might be better as someone said but I canÂ´t see it. I prefer this. </p><p> </p><p>"The show must go on" </p><p> </p><p>&amp; </p><p> </p><p>"Staying alive" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2011, 10:48</p><p>Well, this is rather unexpected turn of events.  </p><p> </p><p>If Eyescene continues taken care of Moonshiner, there will be two discussion boards claiming to be descendatns of this home of our community. There are only two possible outcomes of such situation: </p><p>1. The community will split. </p><p>2. One of the boards will die after some time. </p><p> </p><p>From a general point of view, there is nothing wrong. The world is one large field of competition and the Internet is no exception to the rule. </p><p> </p><p>From my personal point of view I cannot understand this step. Val has successfully started the Vision and Spex (www.vision-and-spex.com/) investing his time and money. The site has had 182 registered members (27th Dec 2011). And anytime I open the site there is at least 1 unregistered guest.  </p><p>Vision and Spex has a lot of advantages:  </p><p>It is easy to check the new posts. The registration guarantees as much anonymity as the Eyescene does. The system is a professional software for discussion boards enabling the users to open as many topics as they wish. The administrator (Val) can assign moderators with some rights to moderate the site (mostly to eliminate spam and trolls). The users can quote contributions of the others and edit "thier potsings to elinimaet tipos". </p><p>Summarized briefly: my opinion is that the Vision and Spex forum system is better and more comfortable. </p><p>So, why there is suddenly a different plan presented here?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John S</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2011, 09:33</p><p>I disagree. If someone was going to continue the site, they would need the skills to do it. Chris wrote the BBS, obviously there is little documentation. The person would have to be savvy enough to take care it. The idea is, Chris wants out. He does not want to babysit the BBS anymore. I have no problem with that. Chris offered to turn over the board to someone else to host. The details must have been worked out. Would have made any difference if that deal was worked out a month ago? I don't think so. Val's board is up, I thank him for going through the trouble and expense to do it. I think there can be a place for both. Val's has a registration process, that might deter some of the fakers. Sure, it will have less traffic, but with good reason. </p><p>I offered hosting space publicly, not privately. But I can't take care of it. Which meant Chris was still tied to it. That was not the answer. </p><p>Moon has worked through the technical details, and will probably get some support for a limited amount of time until he is familiar enough to support it on his own. </p><p>More than ample notice was given that the board was being discontinued. Val jumped in to fill the void, he should be commended for that. Chris hosted the site for at least 14 years, he has found someone capable enough to take it over. He said he would turn it over to someone else if he could to keep it going. Now he kept his word. Now you tell him you think it sucks. That is real gratitude. </p><p>Everyone has an opinion, this is mine. This is a small community. We should be thankful that there are 2 people that are willing to keep our communication line going. Why can't we all just get along? </p><p>This has really hit a sore spot with me (if you can't tell). I have been involved with many non-profit clubs. 1 percent of the people do all the work, I always end up in the 1 percent. The other 99 percent reap the benefits and complain. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2011, 08:31</p><p>Moonshiner and Wurm, personally I think that what you are proposing sucks big time, especially after all the trouble, and some expense that VAL went to to set up vision and specs. </p><p>If you had planned to do this from the beginning that would have been fine, but by announcing that this site was closing unless someoen was willing to take it over you started the ball rolling Wurm. And Val jumped in to pick up the ball. </p><p>I will not waste my time hanging around 2 sites, and I rather doubt that others will as well, so in effect this will sound the death knell for a site that has yet to get off the ground. </p><p>Just my 2 cents worth.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>newglasses</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2011, 07:39</p><p>this would be perfect.

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;22 Dec 2011, 03:15</p><p>Chrisb - what a good point about Betsy! If you check all of her websites now, in their synopsis she mentions first and foremost she is a "girl with glasses" - now I doubt a few months ago if she had been asked to summarise herself that this would have been her one liner, and it is to this very website that we owe a lot of credit to that. </p><p> </p><p>I think Wurm should also be extremely flattered that ES is mentioned in the same context as a household phrase, and world renowned website like Facebook. It just goes to show how a website can and should be run instead of having to register your true identity against everything you post - as wirth Facebook. Having said that, I'm sure Wurm wouldn't be complaining if this site had become as successful as FB, and was worth the same amount!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2011, 18:01</p><p>Evan, gwgs and last but not least Wurm, </p><p> </p><p>Evan - thank you for unearthing this article. Read it with interest even though crippled by a bad concussion so I have to keep it short / slow. I enjoyed the way the writer is describing this (in my humble view, eccentric but rather innocent) village. Sometimes it takes the eye of an outsider to describe a city, a person, a landscape or any other phenomenon better than the insiders can. I had a big smile on my face when the writer mentioned terms like "cut in" and "power rings" - I learned those expressions during the past two or three years here at Eye Scene and now I am using them both here and in "the other world". The quotes about Facebook, I'm afraid, are very near the truth.  </p><p> </p><p>gwgs - your posting reminds me of a discussion I wished to start so often but never got round to start it, being too busy with the photo shoots. My question would be simply: what's wrong with coming out of the closet outside this cosy village and tell the world about your fascination with glasses? I am absolutely sure that Eye Scene is just the tip of an iceberg and there's lots of people attracted by the "bonus" of a well chosen pair of glasses. I am convinced that many opticians came to their profession that way. Gradually expanding my horizons, I noticed among the reactions on Mayhem Model and other sites that the one picture on a model's portfolio that shows her wearing glasses is often called the favourite of the viewers. I did my first exhibition out in the open, in the premises of my employer so to speak. The reactions were mixed - some highly encouraging, some unspoken but avoiding or not at ease. But I never regretted going for the exhibition as it was simply something that had to be shown. The media attention (newspapers, radio. television) was another confrontation but why not take up the challenge? Perhaps some of us here are too shy? Feel free to disagree....  </p><p> </p><p>Wurm - The phrase "The Eye Scene is a brilliant example of a subculture only the internet could have nurtured" in the article posted by Evan is perhaps the best praise ever for your great work. Call it an epitaph, but no doubt there will be reincarnation.... </p><p> </p><p>Just my 2 cents</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>good bye</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2011, 15:31</p><p>thank you very very much, wurm. i never posted and i was not registered till now, but ES was like my secret family, which i daily visited. now it is realy very sad to say good bye.  </p><p>god bless you all!</p><p></p><hr>

I "got into" girls wearing glasses when I was approx 16 years old, and have frequented this board for longer than I can remember, but at least since the turn of the millennium.  </p><p>Now it is shutting down, as the author says in his article, where will be able to find a website that is as well run, well frequented by familiar users who post an interesting series of sightings, links to photos, and new projects (e.g. Stephan &amp; Sandra, Crystal Veil). </p><p> </p><p>For me the jury is certainly out, and I hope that someone can produce a worthy successor. I've maintained various Flickr/YouTube websites for a number of years which hopefully have an appreciative audience here (I know from the viewing stats they are well visited), but do not have the time, nor the technical knowhow to host, maintain &amp; edit a message board as great as this. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks Wurm for all that you have given us, and good luck with your future projects.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2011, 15:14</p><p>Thanks for the link, Evan. I guess I can click off another minute or two on my 15 minutes of fame counter. </p><p> </p><p>I think he's probably right, at least regarding the broad outline of what wore down my willingness to continue. It was becoming clear to me that we'd need to either become some other sort of community (maybe paid, almost certainly credentialed somehow, and perhaps invisible to the internet at large) or simply close up shop. At least with me as the host. Ultimately I decided not to evolve to be more like Facebook, or the Wall Street Journal, or one of the boutique private forums. </p><p> </p><p>I do see Flickr as the greater culprit in my case, with their inane "don't be creepy" rule papering over a lack of education regarding user privacy. (I speak of the Flickr of a couple of years ago - not sure if they've wised up since.) Facebook has generally kept their users' stuff more out of view and presumably offers less in the way of stat logging, so I never really heard much from Facebook users. </p><p> </p><p>Change is inevitable, especially when you're talking about something relatively new like web forums. Running even a smallish anonymous forum in the US may become difficult as more laws come down the pike. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Some people, in what they do, enrich others, and you are one such person. Although I never contributed much to this site, I appreciated it, and will be making a donation to Doctors Without Borders in fond memory of this site. I will be out of town for much of December, and so this may be my farewell. Good luck to you in whatever you do, and good luck to all the fine members of this site. I hope to "see" you all again in the other place. Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year to you all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Albert</b>&nbsp;12 Dec 2011, 21:17</p><p>Wurm, I would like to add my thanks to those of the many others expressed on this thread.  I am mainly a lurker, but am a daily visitor.

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2011, 12:27</p><p>Revolver, </p><p> </p><p>That's one of the major points that I like, being able to make corrections or even additions.  Using the old eyescene, I've actually written text in Word, so that I could spell and grammer check, then cut and pasted to eyescene. No need for that nonsense with the new forum.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2011, 11:55</p><p>As the year-end and the closing of Eyescene near, I would once again like to thank Wurm for this wonderful site.  I've been coming here for 12 or 13 years, don't post much but I'm here generally at least once per day.  It has been a pleasure to read the posts from so many folks, many of whom are very knowledgable about glasses and vision and I have learned much from them.  I also enjoy the lighter banter from many posters that I find very entertaining. </p><p> </p><p>Thank you, thank you Wurm.  I know I like many others will miss this site and truly appreciate all that you have done over the years to keep this site up and running smoothly.  I hope you stay around and that we will see you on the new site.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2011, 09:09</p><p>Dang it!  I just proved one of Specs4's points that you can make corrections and it'll cut down on correction posts.  My last comment about becoming a poster was, of course, meant for Wurm.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2011, 09:07</p><p>Specs4 &amp; Dieter: agree with both of your comments in toto, and thanks for "beating the drum" to helpfully ensure all of us do become active there. </p><p> </p><p>And in that vein, after giving us 14 wonderful years, you have a wealth of knowledge and hope you will be an active poster on the new forum.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2011, 08:02</p><p>I am getting to like the new site better and better all the time Dieter.  If I don't want to post I can just click on it and see if anything new has been added without signing in.  And I like the fact that you can read the posts without registering, but you have to sign in in order to post. Also, the ability to edit a post is nice - should make for a lot less "correction" posts.  </p><p>And, while I haven't done it yet, it appears that you can set your preferences to show the newest posts first. I do know that you can click on new posts and it will only show new posts - but there hasn't been much activity recently.  Guess everyone is waiting for the ball to drop.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2011, 07:36</p><p>Specs4ever, </p><p> </p><p>I agree and am looking forward to getting everyone back in the same place again. Its a hassle to watch both. As the new "eyescene" is a standard/typical "forum" style format, no one should fear it. I've been a member of several other forums, using the same format, for years and the benefits far exceed the extra overhead. You just have to work with it for a while to discover the shortcuts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2011, 07:09</p><p>Well, there are a few visitors going over to vision and specs at least. The first story I posted there in late September has had 663 visitors, and the last one I posted a couple of days ago has had 128 hits. So I am pretty sure that once this board is closed to new posts the visitor count there will increase nicely.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2011, 11:16</p><p>Like everyone else, I offer kudos to Wurm for what he's done over the years, about 12 for me albeit rarely as a poster. </p><p> </p><p>But OnLooker nailed it when he said it's up to us to make the new site what we want it to be.  Let's forget about format even though I don't find it as user friendly as this one, and now concentrate on content.  Eyescene is the medium, and we are the message.  Again, thank you Wurm and now let's move on.  Thank you Val, for making it possible.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2011, 10:17</p><p>To Slit: </p><p>The system Vision-and-spex runs on is a whole complete package provided by FreeForum.org. The features of the system are described at their site. No html knowledge is needed to run it.  </p><p>The structure Val have chosen is very simple. One layer of Forums, in each of which particular topics can be created to separate the threads, themes, stories etc. We decided to keep it as simple as possible by deleteing all subforums. So now there is only one layer of Forums. It is a very practical and useful feature as many people are going to read only their favourite forums/topics. </p><p> </p><p>To Galileo: </p><p>You do not need to fill in anything but a nickname, some email address to confirm your registration, and choose a password. The password is very pactical, as in the new system no-one can pretend to be you. The moderators will see only the information you enter into your profile. We cannot see your IP. So, you do not need to be afraid of anything. BTW, are you sure about your other web activities (browsing, e-mailing, shopping, etc.) to be safe? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2011, 08:26</p><p>All I can say is that Val has done his best to set up a replacement place for us to go.  Once you get used to the navigation it really isn't hard.  And as far as the registration I registered using my "internet" credentials back when he first opened it, and had no problem. </p><p> </p><p>So, for those that are unhappy, either step up to the plate and create what you want for a new site, or end your participation when this site shuts down at the end of the year. </p><p> </p><p>And I am most thankful for Wurm having provided Eyescene for the last 16 years as a forum for us.  The work was thankless, the time involved was all donated, and still he had people who complained. I can certainly understand him wanting to bow out and carry on with his life.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Slit</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2011, 07:19</p><p>Hi Val, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for the response. As of now, I am also a very new beginner with HTML, with almost zero knowledge about php. </p><p> </p><p>Over the next few months I am continuing to study web design, probably will be able to contribute more. </p><p> </p><p>As of now, what you have done is wonderful. Keep up good work. Will try my best to provide some support.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2011, 07:12</p><p>Hi Val, thank you for your efforts in setting up the new site.  I will however be a lurker, the background privacy policies of the board provider do not fill me with confidence and the amount of personal information required by their registration system goes beyond what I'm prepared to give. </p><p> </p><p>So thanks for setting it up, I will be a reader but not a member.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>hooked</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2011, 03:57</p><p>Why should vision-and-spex look like Eyescene? </p><p> </p><p>IMHO content is more important than form. </p><p> </p><p>Nonetheless I thank Wurm for this forum even if I'm not so active. But it is not the first web site I open, it's only the second. (The first one is a German forum about soccer where I'm a moderator.) </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Val</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2011, 01:34</p><p>I am the one that started vision-and-spex forum.  I agree, it's a little hard to use, but, when I started it, it seemed so simple.  </p><p>Wurm was kind enough to offer us nine months advance to start a new forum. Actually in the first three month nothing happened.  We still have one and a half month before closure.  </p><p>I don't know how to make vision-and-spex look like Eyescene. I can only reorganize the postings and the threads to be more accessible.  Maybe one solution to the problem will be to create only one thread and all the postings will be under that thread. I am open to new ideas. </p><p>So please email me at tpcv21@yahoo.com</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Slit</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2011, 23:21</p><p>I must commend the excellent job of  starting vision-and-spex at the time of closure of eyescene. </p><p> </p><p>As I have mentioned before also, Eyescene has been a great place for us to interact and discuss, without being misunderstood. (some topics we discuss here will be too much fetish for many in our society.) </p><p> </p><p>One of the most attractive features of ES technically was the ease of navigation, which is diffecult to achieve in bulletin board styled forums. </p><p> </p><p>Is there a way to adopt the same ES model to the new site as well?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2011, 08:58</p><p>Shekhar: the story was a bit of a parody on a few things, and a light hearted tribute to the many posters that have made ES such a success over the years. Garden Party was just the medium for the message.  And as far as the ending, perhaps in your country you aren't deluged with ads on the telly about prescription drugs for erectile dysfunction.  In the U.S. we are deluged, and each ad contains a disclaimer about the side effects of the drug,one of which is "see your doctor if you experience and erection lasting more than four hours". </p><p> </p><p>As far as the characters, I have met 2 of them personally and corresponded with others, but the rest I could only try to glean a profile from their postings.  And the line about "Yoko even brought her walrus" was directly from the song, spoofing Yoko Ono bringing her husband John Lennon. </p><p> </p><p>Specs4: thank you, a kind word from the master is always appreciated.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2011, 18:19</p><p>Shekar, the theme of the story is based on a song from the 70's called Garden Party by Ricky Nelson.

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2011, 17:20</p><p>I am not certain I could write anything to do the subject justice. Like all writers I write from what I know, with a bit of SF and fantasy thrown in (where you are free to make your own rules, as long as they make some sort of sense). </p><p> </p><p>Being a hetrosexual male, I find writing from that perspective easier. I think can do it from a lesbian's viewpoint, since what we are both looking at is the same thing, although we probably thinking somewhat different things about what we see. When it comes to considering gay males, I freely admit I have got absolutely no experience of that - I personally have never known any gay men - or perhaps they were and didn't say. I wouldn't want to take a story and change the sex of the characters, that seems a false and fake way to do it. </p><p> </p><p>Admittedly I do write from the perspective of a teenage girl in "Dear Diary" but I have known enough of them, I think, to say something vaguely sensible. </p><p> </p><p>There's nothing to stop anyone writing anything, as far as I know. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;13 Oct 2011, 06:51</p><p>I posted the following message over on the new Eyescene, but after I did I realized that over there I was preaching to the folks that have dropped by the new site.  The people I really want to reach are those that haven't registered, nor have they tried to use the new message board. </p><p> </p><p>I have been visiting here at least once a day, and posting whenever I feel I have something to add. I have been hoping that many of the other people from eyescene would gradually start to gravitate to this site. I don't want to see Eyescene close down, but it is going by the wayside by the end of 2011. It seems as if this fact has not sunk in to many of the others, but it is going to happen folks. To me it seems that since Val has provided this site, which he is paying for out of his own pocket, the least we can do is support him with some activity. </p><p>So, I suppose that it will actually take the closing of Eyescene to bring people on board. The day that eyescene closes people will be dragged here kicking and screaming, and there will be all sorts of complaints about how Eyescene was so much better, and easier to use and so on </p><p>As I say, I have been dropping in here at least daily, and I have taken the time to learn how to navigate around a new site. It is a little bit harder, but I certainly appreciate what Val has done.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2011, 17:37</p><p>Hi Wurm, </p><p> </p><p>three months to go before the curtain falls - I fully understand and respect your motives but the world will be a poorer place without ES.  I am sorry for being unable to be of any assiatance in a follow-up. This requires a younger person who knows the modern media.

<p><b>bigO</b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2011, 14:32</p><p>I have been reading ES since the earliest days when it was all just a single page thread. Maybe some may even remember me. I haven't posted for a long time though but I am sad to see what -- to me -- is a piece of Internet history fall by the wayside. I know what running a site is like and I commend Wurm for having the will to run this one so well for so long. The Internet is fast becoming all the things we didn't want it to be and this kind of website is one of the few "oldskool" places where those changes have not occurred. I for one, will miss this place when it goes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Val</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2011, 15:41</p><p>Thank you Wurm, for letting us use the name Eyescene. </p><p>Emphasis on "us". </p><p> </p><p>The first time I've read about Eyescene's closing I was very sad, because, like most readers here, it is the first site I go to when I open the computer every day. And it's been like that for almost 11 years already.  </p><p>And, like many others in here, I stumbled upon Eyescene google-ing about glasses. </p><p>The second variant of Eyescene was the first one for me. And the threads were moderated by people like Julian and others. And we can do it again today. Thank you Slit for offering to do some moderation. </p><p>And thank you all for the support. </p><p> </p><p>My email is tpcv21@yahoo.com, so I'm expecting emails from anybody who wants to help.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2011, 12:05</p><p>I think most people would be happy to see something they created continue on. And now seeing Wurm say he has no problem with that either that should be the end of it. Val I wish you the best in this effort.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2011, 11:43</p><p>Actually Val, Wurm has said that he would be willing to have someone take over Eyescene as it is.  If there were changes to be done, I am certain that this could also be done by anyone who took it over. You should contact Wurm and see if the two of you can work something out.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2011, 11:15</p><p>Perhaps we should have a poll, if this isn't one already. </p><p> </p><p>Personally I don't mind what it's called, it's the content that's important.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2011, 10:32</p><p>Hi Val, </p><p> </p><p>I appreciate that you're going to give it a try. </p><p> </p><p>I think using the name is OK.

<p><b>Slit</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2011, 07:55</p><p>hi all, </p><p> </p><p>being another 10yr+ member of ES, would like to drop a line on closure. </p><p> </p><p>first and foremost, it will be a sad news if this happens.

<p><b>Val</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2011, 01:10</p><p>@Wurm:  If someone will start a new forum like Eyescene,  will you agree to let him use the name Eyescene for the new site ? </p><p>I don't have any experience in managing sites,  but I think I can learn. </p><p>I started  a forum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815103109/http://eyescene.freeforums.org/" target="_blank">http://eyescene.freeforums.org/</a>  as a test. </p><p>If you don't agree with this, I will delete the forum. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2011, 17:05</p><p>Spot on, YoYo, you are absolutely right - but I feel sympathy towards VFL, I understand his sorrow. </p><p>When I first saw a picture of my partner on a dating site, I sat rooted to the spot. I noticed that she was in glasses but it was the look in her eyes that did it. Almost aloof, a bit uneasy, but with a sort of pride as well, the look of a woman who had lived an intense life without losing her grip of things. In other words, stability. I decided to wait 24 hours and to have another look at the picture and then contact her if she'd have the same impact on me. And she did.... So I sent her an email with a big compliment, really expecting nothing at all, not even a reject. No answer came, so I started dating other women (all in glasses), great dates, but something kept withdrawing me. Ten days later I received an email and boy, it was her - sending me a message that she was honoured and suggesting a place &amp; time for a date, her motto was "surprise me!". I was clearly an outsider from her point of view. When we saw eachother from a distance for the first time, I spread my armes, walked towards her, gave her a big hug and simply said, "You really exist - and I'm so happy to see you!". This may sound as a carte blanche and in some ways it was - so much to be "filled in" but my simple basic feeling came through and this soon lead to a relation which is still going strong after three years. I only later noticed that her glasses were twice as strong as expected, but that was merely a bonus. Some of the aloof feel of the first picture was caused by the -11 lenses in her glasses. Needless to say, I would have stepped out very soon if there had been serious alarm signals. I love her as a person, as a woman, and I like the bonus of her strong glasses - but in that order!  </p><p>VFL - there are plenty of fish in the sea, high myopic or just very mild.... I wish you luck!       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Millhouse</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2011, 12:44</p><p>VHL-  Im sure we are all with you on that! Long live GWG. You'll be ok, move on, get out there, make friends.

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2011, 12:41</p><p>Yes, while I'll always enjoy looking at women in glasses, IMO it's the kind of thing you have to be willing to put aside in the search for a romantic companion. My long-term girlfriend (who I'm very happy with) only wears weak minus glasses occasionally (to watch movies, etc.), and the glasses are not at all the reason I'm attracted to her. </p><p> </p><p>Glasses are objects, often nice to look at, but they are not a replacement for personality.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2011, 11:35</p><p>What happened is I gave to much to someone who was unworthy.  The glasses is what pulled me in and kept me in.  The relationship ended very badly and once again I am kicking myself for being so stupid.  When will I ever learn?  I have discussed this with professionals and even though I intellectually know what is happenening with me, I have never been able to resist the pull of the lenses.  Ah well, live and learn and try to do better next time. </p><p> </p><p>Thank you all for coming to my side.  I am just glad that I am not alone in my love of the lens.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2011, 00:12</p><p>I hate to think this site may be coming to an end. It has been a part of my daily routine since I first stumbled across Eye Scene in 1998. At that time it was the single topic polls and I thought it was fascinating. The night I discovered Eye Scene I stayed up until 5 a.m. reading all of the previous polls. For old times sake, over the weekend I looked up those old polls in the archives and once again had a great time reading the posts and remembering some of my favorite characters. I particularly enjoyed reading the stories from different people about their experiences wearing glasses, even the ones that appeared to be fake. Rather that getting rid of Eye Scene all together I wish there was a way to go back to a simpler site, like those single topic polls.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2011, 14:09</p><p>VFL - been there too, she held me in a spell for over a year then I realised there were things behind the strong high index lenses which I would not be able to live with for the rest of my life and I ended it.

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2011, 11:13</p><p>Well, at least it's over. It's not going to get any worse, is it? Move on older and wiser, better luck next time, etc.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2011, 10:50</p><p>VFL:  Could have been worse if she had ended it . . . </p><p> </p><p>Try this: </p><p>Take all the money you would have spent on her for the next 6 months. </p><p>Buy a nice pair of women's glasses on-line.  Make sure to add 5 to 10 more diopters than hers onto the lenses. </p><p>Have sex (even if you have to pay for it) with many different women wearing this pair of glasses.

<p><b>John S</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2011, 13:58</p><p>Dave, </p><p>Google just gives access to the newsgroups from a web browser. The "newsgroups" are actually Usenet. Usenet is usually accessed using a client such as Forte Agent. Since most people using the internet did not know what Usenet was, and if they did, they did not know how to use it. Google decided to develop an web based interface/archive. </p><p>I know several people that would be clueless if they wanted to get Usenet without Google groups. </p><p> </p><p>I would be glad to donate hosting space, but I am not savvy when it comes to BBS software.

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2011, 14:50</p><p>I'm still thinking about that, LG. My provisional plan is to leave the discussion threads up but with a little explanatory note in place of the posting link. The link threads would be deleted.  </p><p> </p><p>I'd leave the door open for anyone who would like to revive or continue the site down the road, probably by just leaving my email address somewhere. Someone who is just a kid now could find this material years later and have the sort of revelatory experience that tends to be a common theme in feedback I've received over the years.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2011, 13:29</p><p>Wurm,  </p><p>What becomes of this site once shut down? By that I mean, will you leave it frozen with posting disabled, or actually clear the server? I may be in the minority, but I often find myself scanning way back through threads to find some piece of information, name, or link from years ago. It would be a shame to have such a database lost to all time! Still, from the user's end it is very hard make an effective archive copy. It would be wonderful if there was a way to make a zip database for us old-timers to download, but I suspect the time commitment would score low on your priority list. Possibly a small Perl wedge that could automate the process may be less of a time commitment. Just some thoughts...   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

That is completely not true. Does it matter if your the first to answer or reply to someone or if 3 rd or 8th? I have several times backing a comment made by others to reenforce the answer given if I agreed with it. To may way of thinking that should make the person asking for information feel better the more that confirm an answer. Several times someone has also backed an answer I have given. I have no problem at all if someone does not agree with something I have said or has a different opinion than I do to replay as such. Is that not what an OPEN forum is all about? You have said you have been under attack, not by me I made one reply untill now I don't think anyone would call this an attack at you or anyone. I think we all welcome as many that wish to reply to do so. So far you seem to only be making an argument for others that may or may not exist out there. I will say again there is no reason that others can't or shouldn't respond if they wish to contribute, don't blame me or the so called other 4 -6 whoever they maybe. By the way someone said I should "man-up" I think I have by admitting to be one of the dreaded 5 - 7. I know I am without a doubt one of the 5 - 7 referred to. </p><p>All the replies I have ever given is only meant to be helpful and if you go back you will find more than once that I have stated I am not a doctor. Not sure how much clearer I can be? If  doctor ever does pop-up in here I wonder if he /she would get the same treatment only because someone wants to be first? I for one would love to see a doctor come on board, I think it would be a great addition to the forum. You should feel the same way, but who knows?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2011, 15:28</p><p>If we are talking inaccurate analogies, then "student in class" is inaccurate too. There are people here asking questions and looking for answers without worrying too much who the responders are, the people here are not necessarily looking to learn but more likely to share knowledge not known to others, regular posters or not. That's not the same as a "student in class" situation where we have a single font of knowledge. </p><p> </p><p>As far as I can see I can see no evidence offered to support your assumptions or allegations, despite repeated invitations from me to provide or point at such. Without that they remain opinions, you're allowed to have them but they don't have anyone elses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Susan I</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2011, 15:03</p><p>@Puffin.  I must correct your inaccurate analogy.  By the way, I would hope no one ever comes to a glasses fetish board seeking medical advice which should be more appropriately given out by a doctor.  I don't think anyone here should presume Eyescene can offer that same level of assistance at all.  I have never seen anyone requesting immediate urgent assistance either, and if they did need that, again, they should seek a real doctor's advice, never trust an eye fetish forum. </p><p> </p><p>You seem to take an odd stance on vilification.  You forget about the student in a class who keeps raising his hand with the answer just because he is louder and faster than everyone else and it doesn't give others a chance to participate.  Are you calling it "vilification" of the student if we ask that student to sit back and let others take a chance at answering the questions?  Even for a little while?  Are you saying it is not an arrogant view by those posters to assume no one else but them has the correct answers? </p><p> </p><p>Now how should we react if a Student Advisor coming into the classroom observes the bold student's behavior and suggests he give others an opportunity to answer?  Is it appropriate for that student to viciously attack the Student Advisor for daring to offer up that opinion?  For challenging what he feels is his absolute constitutional right of dominance because it is an open forum?   </p><p> </p><p>Try looking at things from a different perspective.  You might see something very interesting once in awhile.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2011, 14:37</p><p>The other thing is, it is entirely possible that a poster looking for help with a prescription will be nervous or uncertain, and will more likely accept and trust advice from someone who has offered up advice many times before, and seems to know what they're talking about, rather than a responder they've never seen before. Would they then call the regular responder "arrogant" or "egotistical", </p><p>regardless of the answer, and then wait for someone never seen posting here ever before to answer? That seems unlikely. </p><p> </p><p>It is as if when you go to a doctor in a surgery, you go in with some complaint (say, suspected cancer) and demand to see the most recently qualified doctor on the premises, preferably one just arrived from medical school, just so you can encourage him along his career path and he doesn't give up medicine, but when other doctors who are much more experienced offer to help, you bat them away with accusations of being in a selfish, tight-knit clique, being arrogant, and suggesting they are egotistical for for not giving the freshman a chance to pronounce a verdict (right or wrong) first. </p><p> </p><p>Personally I'd go to the one who more obviously has seen the most and knows the most. I wouldn't care that much about the career or ego of whoever did the advising. I'd be caring far more about the accuracy of the advice. I certainly wouldn't go in there accusing all the other doctors of all sorts of nefarious motives for offering their advice. Of course none of us here are doctors (as far as I know), but the analogy is not invalid.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2011, 14:07</p><p>That's fair enough. Admittedly I usually only read the "New Glasses/Post your Prescription" ie "help, I have a prescription, what does it mean?" - and occasionally dip into the threads containing basically idle chit-chat about glasses, I don't read every last post - but I can't recall ever seeing any "new posters" here explicitly or implicitly told they're wrong or wasting their time. If you can point at some instances, why not do so? </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps we are a tight-knit bunch because over the last couple of years we've every so often had some disruptive people appearing telling us we are wrong, we are perverts, we shouldn't be looking at pictures, etc etc, without any real reason why, other than they have their own pre-judged opinion and disagree with what we are about here. That does not imply that we are trying to exclude others who might broadly agree with the purpose of the board (ie, talking about glasses). </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps the reason for the personal attacks on you is that some of those who have supplied much help and information in the past have been suddenly vilified for doing so, and told they must not do so because some supposed silent lurkers are out there desperate to post but unable to do so because someone else has answered first. I don't know, but I think if someone called me "arrogant" or "unfriendly", I would at least need to know why other than the stating and restating of an opinion, especially if all were doing was trying to help. </p><p> </p><p>It is all very well talking about group theory, as if we have a clique of people who don't want to share, but who decides that we have such a thing here? As far as I am aware, this site is here to spread the idea that glasses are good and acceptable and don't detract from attractiveness. This "mission" can't have changed, because every so often new posters appear and nobody seems to shout them down. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Susan I</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2011, 13:26</p><p>I have said my peace, but I do need to add more.  Bear with me. </p><p> </p><p>@Puffin.  I suggest you do some reading on group analysis.  I have studied group behavior for many years.  Believe it or not, shyness is only a small factor in determining why people do not contribute to a group.  Most often cited is because they feel what they have to offer has already been brought to the table by others, in this case, the same 5-7 people, negating their reason to contribute.  Sometimes people feel there is a tightly formed clique which attacks others not in the group, and based upon the attacks of the so-called "new posters" I believe that is quite apparent here on Eyescene.  Other times people do not play in the game is because they feel their contribution must meet an unfairly high set of expectations, aka quality standards, or they will be told they are wasting others' time, aka what they have to say just isn't important enough for the group. </p><p> </p><p>What's sad is all the above reasons why people do not contribute to a group have been validated in this Eyescene thread.  There have been vicious attacks against me.  The non-contributors have been negatively tagged as "too shy," "wallflowers," "weak," and high expectations have been unfairly placed upon their postings so much so that they had better be something worth waiting for if others are being asked to momentarily step aside from control of the microphone for five minutes.  Add to that the class distinction being repeatedly mentioned of "old posters" vs "new posters" with an inference that "old posters" are somehow better and more quality controlled than the newer ones. </p><p> </p><p>This is what I am seeing in Eyescene.  This is what disappoints me.  This is what I hope could someday turn around and make this a welcome, comfortable community again for all to contribute.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2011, 17:16</p><p>I don't really wish to start anything else off here about the recent controversy, but felt I had to say this: </p><p> </p><p>I don't have any more information about site and thread viewing stats than anyone else has here, obviously apart from the owner, but it must be asked - how are we so certain that these non-posting lurkers actually exist?  </p><p>The possibility can't be ruled out, but how do we know? </p><p> </p><p>Even assuming there is an unknown quantity of lurkers, their silence and invisibility to the rest of us gives us no indication of their motivations for lurking and not posting. On that basis, why assume that any or all are shy and are waiting for the board to quieten down? They just might not have time to say anything. Or their boss might come in before they can contribute. There are many reasons for apparent "shyness". If anyone can say how anyone here can know anything about invisible silent internet users, then please go right ahead and say so.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>still</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2011, 21:49</p><p>As a long-time lurker, I want to say something, even though the preceding interesting discussion seems almost played out: What bothers me about what I've been reading is the raw feelings that some people seem to have. Whatever for? This has been a great site, and many of us, I think, have had a lot of fun being here. I've enjoyed what people had to say. I'm grateful to Wurm, as I have said before, but also I am grateful to the frequent posters, who often have somehting worth while and intelligent to contribute. I agree with someone who said earlier that nothing in the frequent posters' contributions makes it harder for anybody else to put in their 2 cents. So what is the problem? As people say in NJ, "Fogettaboudit!"  Get back to having fun. That's why we come here.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2011, 17:29</p><p>Susan, </p><p>As a relatively frequent poster in response to technical questions, I would like to ask your advice on how long I should wait before answering a technical question?  There are a few of us who specialize in the technical and psychological area of this site.  However, I personally would gladly defer to your knowledge of optics and vision and bow out.  It gets tiring answering the same questions over and over.  Maybe I should answer a question only once and subsequent posters can either search the site for the question and that answer no matter how long ago the conversation took place. Perhaps I should respond by saying: "The question has been answered, Tough!, go find another site. </p><p>I try to concentrate on helping people understand their vision problems and sometimes a question that takes 30 seconds to write requires an answer that takes 30 minutes to compose and edit so that makes sense to a person with no technical background and accomplishes the mission of promoting understanding. </p><p>Many times the answer evokes another, related question.  How should that be handled? </p><p>May I suggest that instead of complaining about what you perceive as a problem, you also propose concrete solutions such a limits to the number of posts, length of posts, subjects of posts, and other ways to improve the site. </p><p>A quotation comes to mind: "It is better to light a candle, than curse the darkness".

<p><b>Susan I</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2011, 16:54</p><p>All of the responses with the giant ego's are exactly what I was talking about in my earlier posting.  Instead of taking blame for overfilling the boards with posts every day, the same 5-7 people instead chose to blame everyone else for not chipping in.  Rather than recognizing their continual need for the spotlight is the real problem here.  The level of negativity being expressed toward others who don't post as often is simply incredible and exemplifies exactly everything I said in my earlier posting.  This has become a community of 5-7 people who dominate every thread. </p><p> </p><p>About the stepping back experiment:  I never said 24 hours. I said two weeks.  Why not give it a try, the board is going to close in six months anyway, right?  So if you are a poster here who posts more than three times a week, sit back relax and drink some lemonade for the next two weeks and we'll see what happens when others have the opportunity to post.  Your assumption that the board would be dead makes another assumption that the board is all about you.  I am sure we have many treasures in our Eyescene community who have yet not spoken.   </p><p> </p><p>Maybe Wurm could invite them now to step forward and take the mic for a couple of weeks?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Susan I</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2011, 17:45</p><p>Perhaps an argument can be made that those individuals with the right knowledge continually come forward to the "first aid" threads but I think the point you might be missing here is that you are also making a presumption that no one else here would answer those questions if they didn't do it.  I think we would be surprised to learn what other treasures of knowledge we have in our community if the same posters weren't so quick to leap to answer all the time.  That same eagerness also discourages others from participating. </p><p> </p><p>It's an interesting thing to observe over the years, and the same 5-7 call "themselves" the old ones while forgetting there are many, many folks out there who have never posted who are also the old ones too. </p><p> </p><p>Sometimes I wonder just how big Eyescene is, but when the same folks continually post everyday over and over again, it gives the impression of a clique of just a few where the rest of the community is not invited to participate, just read.  Personally I know that I have not answered many threads because of this reason.  I have felt shunted. </p><p> </p><p>It might be good for all those overeager posters to just sit back for a couple weeks, try it out... see what happens in Eyescene.  Would we see participation from folks who never spoke before? Would it just sit and die?  or would perhaps those same folks create other names and just post under those names instead... </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2011, 16:36</p><p>The word "posting" may require a few nuances here. Some "first aid" threads are of the Q&amp;A; type: people come up with a problem about glasses and eyesight, hoping (and my guess is, expecting) that some experts will have an answer which can be of value. In that case one might argue that the 5-7 "posters" obligingly come up with the answers, even if the answers to very similar questions have been given many times before. In that case the word "dominating" is simply an optical illusion. I usually confine myself to the "seen on the web" thread but occasionally I answer some questions on the "first aid" threads when speaking from personal experience. I never feel shy about "trespassing", never regard any thread as "owned" or dominated by one or two members with a more thorough knowledge. Looking forward to read more comments on the matter!   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2011, 15:39</p><p>Susan/Dave </p><p> </p><p>My own view is that matters is the usefulness and/or interest of the mesaages, not who the poster is.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2011, 15:31</p><p>Good point Susan I. Perhaps a way of dealing with this is self moderation. Also, it should not be difficult to add a count of the number of posts or words an individual made in, say, the last 24 hours, week and month, so as people could be more aware of how much text they produce. </p><p> </p><p>don't know who you refer to in the 5-7 posters, but in count I just did on the Vision thread, 9 out of 49 posts were made by the same person, and non of these were particularly short.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Susan I</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2011, 13:51</p><p>Something that has bothered me over the years is that Eyescene has become the personal sounding board for about 5-7 people who feel like it is their esteemed and honorable duty to post each and every single day in several threads.  While I think the "community" aspect of Eyescene is a good thing, these folks never give any of the lurkers in the community a chance to weigh in with their own ideas because these 5-7 folks are so busy trying to impress everyone here with their opinions and "knowledge."  It's good to have knowledge and want to share it, but it's also good to know when to step back even when you know the answer to let others have a say in the spotlight.  Think about that... you all know who you are. </p><p> </p><p>Like all good things, this too must come to an end.  It's not the same, but the comments about the fakers are out of place.  Some of us who have been around since the beginning will remember "Jennifer" and other fakes that have always been here.  Maybe it's because of the dominance of this board by 5-7 people we don't see more, but I would offer than it isn't any different in that respect than before.  Personally I think it's the ego's that are driving this board into the ground, but that's just me.</p><p></p><hr>

Read it, and then read further(more recent)postings on this topic, and you too can see that Wurm has indicated that his timeline is roughly year's end - unless someone else steps up to the plate. </p><p>Yes, I do post under a "user name", as do most of the other people here. However my user name has remained the same for the past 15 years, so that whenever I post people know it is from me. During the 15 years I have been posting there have been a number of anonymous posters, who, for the most part contribute nothing to the site, and get their jollies in being rabble rousers - one of the reasons why Wurm is ending his chore of keeping the site up and running - in my opinion. </p><p>Not every anonymous poster is like that, but this is the main reason why I have nothing but disdain for anonymous posters. </p><p>And as far as your comment goes Mr. 8Ball, no one in their right mind should post on the internet under their real name - unless they are a blogger or someone who gets paid for postings.  I don't want people who don't agree with my views to come knocking on the door of my house intent on doing harm to me or my family.  There are enough people here who I consider friends who know me personally, and know my true identity, but they have all earned the right to know it.  </p><p>And with regards to passive visitor's comment, I didn't see anything that I considered patronizing in Filty's little posting. He just called it like he saw it. I have always welcomed any newcomer who wished to post.

<p><b>Smudger</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2011, 04:36</p><p>I've just ploughed through some of the original polls to find my first ever post! </p><p> </p><p>Back in the days before I acquired a "u" in my username (which I have decided to drop again!) </p><p> </p><p>Nearly 14 years ago now - amazing! </p><p> </p><p>Thanks Wurm for an excellent service. </p><p> </p><p>The post is repeated below for posterity  </p><p> </p><p>"Wed Aug 13 10:16:22 1997 </p><p> </p><p>Smudger </p><p>I've been ploughing through the correspondence for the past few weeks and have found the discussions most stimulating. Like most of the newcomers to this scene, I have always thought that I was the only man that found girls in glasses highly attractive. It is nice to know that I'm not as weird as I thought. Or if I am then there are plenty of other weird guys out there like me which is a comforting thought. I have visited the glasses exhibition at the Crafts Council in Pentonville Road, London and found it excellent. One of the best features is that they have a selection of frames which you can try on around the exhibition hall. Unfortunately, for those like me that enjoy testing other prescriptions, they all have plain lenses but it's still good fun, free entry and worth a visit if you're in London. To catch up on all the topics that I've missed will take some time, however I'd like to start with the last one. My favourite all-time glasses film is "The World's oldest living bridesmaid", previously mentioned by Lucky (6 Aug. '97). Donna Mills is convincing as a glasses wearer and actually uses about three or four different frames during the film. The story line is dreadful, but she has such gorgeous eyes which are enhanced by the frames that it is worth watching over and over again. How about trying to get a still frame on the Girls with glasses film page? (Limedip take note!). A French film called "Ma vie sexuelle" has just been released at the Renoir Cinema, Brunswick Square, London. I haven't seen it yet, but the poster features an attractive actress wearing glasses. I was interested to hear that Iris asks her boyfriends to keep their glasses on during sex. My wife does not need glasses (unfortunately) however she was prescribed a pair of +0.25 in each eye about five years ago. She obliges me by keeping these next to our bed - what a lucky guy I am. She has recently wanted to update her frames, but in the UK this is quite difficult as opticians refuse to copy the prescription from her current frames. I have found one dispenser in a market who will copy from existing glasses, but the only other solution that I can come up with is ready made readers. Does anyone know where we might be able to buy "off the peg" glasses with a low + or - prescription - preferably in the UK or by mail order? As far as celebritys with glasses are concerned, there can only be one winner. There was an episode of Noel's House Party when Ulrika Jonnsen collected her "Gotcha Oscar" and she was wearing glasses with a prescription of about -1.50. She looked absolutely incredible. With the current fad for retro-chic I wonder if the large coloured "Anglo-American Eyewear" plastic frames will come back into fashion. I must confess a fondness for those- Deidre in Coronation Street currently sports some large red ones. Others who used to be seen wearing specs occasionally to great effect were Lorraine Kelly on GM-TV (former UK Female spectacle wearer of the year) and Carol Barnes (ITN). Thank you for a brilliant site. And to Jennifer, Hayley, Nicole, Gayle, Iris, Scarlett and all the other girls out there - keep wearing those glasses - you all look gorgeous. PS Is the Morgan Fairchild picture still available? PPS	I'll tell you my eye history one day, it's quite interesting as I'm short-sighted in one eye and long-sighted in the other."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2011, 23:41</p><p>I passed the 10 year mark myself either this year recently or last, I don't remember but a lot has changed since I found the site.  </p><p> </p><p>It was an epiphany for me as well, as I'd always had the same fascination when it first manifested in finding myself attracted to cartoon girls who had been hypnotized or when the hypnosis could be blocked with glasses of some kind as a kid. It was similar whether the girl was helpless when hypnotized (staring blankly into the distance) or lost without her glasses. I intially found ES after following a link through an Alpha Flight fan page where the site owner noticed that in one particular issue, the writer or artist went into great detail when Heather Hudson (wife of the lead superhero) has her glasses knocked off and is helpless, not able to see anything in the distance etc, on the same page was a link to ES and his guess that the people who worked on  </p><p>that comic would probably be one of us (published long before ES I think however). I'd say that instance changed my life forever lol </p><p> </p><p>Because of the site I found the courage to get my own first ever eye exam which I posted the results on here, mild hyperopia with astigmatism with instructions only to wear when my eyes got tired on the computer (still do occasionally), but I've since flip flopped over to being -0.5 and - 0.75 respectively and wearing those full time instead. Bifocals are probably coming. The thing I miss and remember most about the old ES was the fantasy optical section along with the sightings and many many more fakes. I felt the site started to lose its way once Wurm decided to make it more "serious" and "professional" with the re-org. My taste has also flipepd from myopes to hyperopes these days just like my prescription, hyperopes past a certain point are  helpless at all distances plus the element of 'surrendering' to the glasses and natural vision becoming drastically worse once adapting is far more powerful than a girl just squinting to see distance to me nowadays. I'm a fan of low to medium rx's and the struggling and trying to focus, once it gets to a point where someone is legally blind and just stops 'trying' to see bare-eyed a lot of the interest is lost. </p><p> </p><p>I'm thinking if I get a chance in the following months I may resurrect my own version of a fantasy optical, especially since I still have an archive of favourites with most of the old sites down. The other site I miss most is smudge report, which seems to have died along with geocities. Both ES and Smudge Report formed the fulcrum of my first journey into this fetishism back in the day!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2011, 12:56</p><p>I will be sad in a way to see it go, but it hasn't been the site I loved  for many years now.  Or maybe I haven't been the person who loved this site for many years now.  I cannot reliably distinguish the two.  What I still know is that, for me, girl with glasses &gt; girl without glasses.  Always. </p><p> </p><p>I think Wurm has done an admirable job managing many diverse interests and personalities, but the site by the very nature of its subject matter is going to attreact a spectrum of mutually incompatible types. </p><p> </p><p>I think in the early years, when the www was new to many, people were just so overjoyed to find that their interest was shared with others in the world that they stayed on their best behavior.  Now, we are awash in glasses porn and cheap high prescription glasses for sale, the squabbles are getting more and more frequent, and the linked material is becoming ever more questionable in taste.  Like anything else in life, abundance breeds indifference and contempt. Those glasses that people like S sell would have fetched hundreds a decade ago; now they fetch a few tens, because the ways and means to get them are well known and people are able to satisfy their appetites. </p><p> </p><p>Is all of this a bad thing?  I think it is neither good nor bad; merely the reality of human nature, anonymity, and group dynamics.  But I will always have a soft spot for the original crowd on this site, and for the moment of epiphany when I first discovered it back in 1997.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2011, 20:05</p><p>You miss the point.  Stephan has never admitted to this being a business.  He has always represented it to be him selling off extra items in his collection, or, in the last year or so, selling off the entire remainder of his collection.  I don't think anyone really cares much, but it is interesting to see how the marketing works - he has figured out that if you sell the glasses as previously worn, especially by someone who looked as hard-core sexy as Sandra did in some of those extreme outfits, they command a much higher price. </p><p> </p><p>I don't understand Wurm to object to the fact that S. is running a business, or even that he may be passing it off as something other than a business.  I do understand him to say that it is difficult to get too worked up about people speculating about the business' nature in these circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>As usual, that position seems entirely reasonable.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2011, 21:11</p><p>gwgs, </p><p> </p><p>See my post 15 Apr 2011, 14:53 for an overview of the time commitment. Most of the time is spent keeping current on all the threads. A bit using FTP to review site logs and delete posts when necessary. Some very simple PHP tweaks to implement or update user bans. And every so often a larger chunk doing real Perl or PHP work to keep the site running properly when the web host reconfigures something or to implement a spam block or other new feature. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe the hardest part is being the 'heavy' who decides what flies and what doesn't. Who considers when to take input democratically and when to play the petty dictator. And then communicates those decisions in a way that hopefully doesn't put too many people off. But that could also be done by committee (and it is at many forums). </p><p> </p><p>As I mentioned before, I continue could fund the site for the foreseeable future if a group would like to take over the management. It's about US $120 a year in hosting and domain fees.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;17 Apr 2011, 10:07</p><p>When I first discovered Eyescene it was about 6 months after Wurm had started it.  I had been hanging around Deja news until that time, and I noticed that the postings on Deja had dropped off considerably. So I went looking and discovered Eyescene.  All the folks from Deja were already there - some real, some not. The real ones, like Wurm, and Filthy and Neuro Joe are still here. The ones who were not real, have long since reinvented themselves. </p><p> </p><p>As Eyescene developed, I realized that I was not alone in the world, and that there was a whole community out there that consisted of people from all over the world, from all walks of life that, like myself, had a fascination for glasses </p><p> </p><p>I had been doing GOC, but was hesitant to talk about this too much, so I invented a secondary character who was proportedly a high minus male, and using this manner I introduced my ideaâs on wearing GOC to stimulate being very myopic.  Not what I should have done, I admit, but I wanted to direct the dialogue myself, and by doing this I saw that doing GOC was accepted by most. Now doing GOC is an accepted fetish. And, no I am not saying I developed GOC, as this was around long before I was, but I think I was one of the first to admit doing it openly. </p><p> </p><p>Back in 97 the availability on the web of finding pictures of women wearing glasses was almost non existent. I remember the first collection that was posted on Eyecene, and I was thrilled to find them. Now there are all sorts of pictures available, thanks to Micha, and Konstantine, who have a lot of pictures of real ladies who wear glasses.  And thanks to Alain, and Crystal Veil and Stephan and Sandra there is a veritable cornucopia of pictures of ladies wearing glasses that are not their own, but are still wonderful pictures. If it had not been for Eyescene I wonder if any of these pictures would have surfaced. </p><p> </p><p>Also, soon after Eyescene came into being there was very little on the web in the form of fictional stories about GWG, or MIGâs.  So, I started off writing a few stories that I sent around to my friends from eyescene for their enjoyment.  They suggested that I should post them somewhere, and Lenslover created a site and offered to put them there.  Since that time I have written, either by myself or in collaboration with others, 256 stories. </p><p> </p><p>I canât imagine Eyescene as being in any other format than a bulletin board format. Facebook might be a possibility, but the anonymity of this forum would be gone.  Of course some of the phonies that are on facebook might then have to resurface under a different identity, so that might not be all bad. </p><p> </p><p>I do understand Wurmâs desire to step down. I have also considered stopping writing, and the only thing that has kept me going is that there is no one else that has come along that is able to fill the gap.  But the day is soon coming where the ideas for new stories will no longer be there. Even now I sometimes feel that I am rehashing an old plot with different characters. </p><p> </p><p>If Eyescene dies a natural death at the end of 2011, so be it.  There will be something eles that will come along. Thanks so very much Wurm for starting this site. Thank you Andy for your contributions over the years.  And thanks to Lenslover for your friendship and help in getting me started. And, Pete, your input was very valuable as well.</p><p></p><hr>

However, if you're still of the same mind, then try to find a like-minded soul to host this site. I'd like to, but I lack the resources, expertise and, frankly, the inclination.

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2011, 07:43</p><p>Well if people are chiming in, I may as well too. I discovered Eyescene in my late teens in the late 90's (very near the beginning), not too long after I started using the internet generally. Not too sure how I found it, as this was certainly before the ubiquity of Google (Altavista anyone?). </p><p> </p><p>Before Eyescene, I had no idea there were other people fascinated and even turned on by glasses. Eyescene also taught me about GOC. It was many years before I stopped being a lurker and started commenting - I now regret that I spent more years lurking than commenting.  </p><p> </p><p>Since my initial discovery of the site, I have lived in 4 countries, and Eyescene was always with me. It has been a comfort, especially when other facets of my life have been inconstant. </p><p> </p><p>I would be very sad if this were to be the end, but understand Wurm's feelings (and as I am volunteering for nothing, am obviously in no position to criticise). That said, while I am certainly no Luddite, I don't think Facebook is the right forum or modality to take over the community we have here - it is my sincere hope that someone will try to replicate the clean, no frills but brilliant bulletin board system Wurm has built here.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Therouteur</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2011, 07:36</p><p>Sad </p><p> </p><p>The problem with having somebody "take over" is that I just can't imagine anybody bringing the same moderation and wisdom to the job as Wurm has over these fourteen years. I've always been impressed with the great judgment with which he has defused contretemps and handled some very difficult issues.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>benn</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2011, 17:40</p><p>I have been coming here since 98/99. You taught me how to do GOC, almost full time now. And learned so much. I will pay if we can go around "Pay Pal". And I must say I am not a Face Book fan for the same reason, security. </p><p> </p><p>All things end, and if it must I will be sorry.

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2011, 14:53</p><p>Thanks for all the nice thoughts and kind words. That means a lot to me. </p><p> </p><p>I think I saw a couple of questions in there, too. I'll try to answer those: </p><p> </p><p>Timeline: I think I'd like to get this resolved by the end of the year (or thenabouts). </p><p> </p><p>How much time I put in: Between reading threads I wouldn't otherwise bother with, deleting posts and responding to feedback I think I put in perhaps 3 or 4 hours a week. Every so often there is a major issue, whether social or technical, that might require 8-10 hours of effort to resolve. Overall it's not a huge time commitment. </p><p> </p><p>As always, if people would like to start a related project (which could be as simple as Guest's suggestion to start a Facebook group) I'm open to having it promoted here to get a core user-base going.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2011, 11:27</p><p>Wurm, </p><p>I hope that you are not in a hurry to shut down ES, but I understand that 14 years is a long time.  I frankly donât remember when I started posting on ES - 7 or 8 years ago??) and I want to personally thank you for providing such a fine service.  I hope my contributions have been worthy of my ecellent host.  </p><p>If you decide to pass the torch, I hope you will be as diligent in choosing your successor as you have been in running the site.  This site has done a lot of good for a lot of people by providing a forum for asking questions and getting answers about vision and vision correction.  You and ES have done a lot more than is apparent on the surface. I still canât and wonât reveal more than this, but ES and your assistance helped thwart a potential kidnaping several years ago.  Your assistance helped locate the perpetrators and the victim, rescue the victim, and bring the perpetrators to justice.  The outcome of that situation was better than any of us could have hoped for at that time and all involved are grateful for your help. </p><p>I believe we all hope you will continue as long as you wish. </p><p>Cactus Jack</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2011, 09:09</p><p>Probably a bit premature, but if this site does wind up, where do we all decamp to? This is the only place I've discussed glasses anywhere ever.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2011, 08:27</p><p>Wurm@ </p><p> </p><p>hat off for your Trojan work at Eyescene during the past 14 years. Do you have any idea how many hours it costed you weekly? This would be useful information for anyone who might be interested to thread in your footsteps. </p><p> </p><p>I was not aware of the existence of Eyescene until December 2009 when I discovered that my weblog had drawn some attention. The past 16 months were not only a massive learning process in photography but also in the background and interest of many other glasses afficionados.  </p><p> </p><p>The Eyescene community is "the village of Asterix &amp; Obelix" in a contemporary manner. Dispute about the quality of some fish sold on the market, a sense of "us against them" when it comes to the appreciation of glasses and their owners ("them" being the Romans in the Asterix stories), Cactus Jack in the role of Nestorix, your good self as the wise druid Panoramix and so on. </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for the kind words about my project "Ladies behind crystal veil". You are modest about your own role. Your work for Eyescene gave me a peer group and I am grateful for that. The discussions and response were - and still are - of great value to me. I am in the process of posting a photo shoot with a new model and all I can say is "hope you like it". Kind regards from Holland!  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

I have enjoyed this site for some 10 or 12 years now, and although not a regular poster I'm here daily seeing what is new and interesting.

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;14 Apr 2011, 11:20</p><p>This is a post I've been pondering for quite awhile, and I want to do it at a time when the forum is relatively drama-free so it's clear to everyone where my head is at. This seems like that time. </p><p> </p><p>I've been running the site for about 14 years. For the most part it's been great fun and I certainly get wonderful feedback on a regular basis. This is a bit of an odd site, of course, but even considering that it's been good as a resume/portfolio item at some key times in my working life. And it has more than paid for itself via Optical4Less and Albert's generous sponsorship a few years back. I also had help from volunteer moderators for a couple of years and a sprinkling of donations, all of which is greatly appreciated. Finally, seeing a major project like Crystal Veil come to pass and imagining that I played some small part in it is extremely gratifying. With all that said, I've been considering my exit strategy. </p><p> </p><p>IMPORTANT PART: I'm not shutting down the site now, or even soon (barring unforeseen events, of course). But I would like to start publicly entertaining the notion of handing the site over, winding it down, or perhaps altering it in some way to lighten the daily review/maintenance load. </p><p> </p><p>While I still like the site, and some days even love it, my original passion for it has dimmed quite a bit with passing years. Glasses are now 'hip', I've proven some things to myself regarding a long-term project, and a great deal of fun has been had by many. Yay! Now, with all those goals met, I'm beginning to think it might be best to go out on top.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Art</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2011, 06:01</p><p>My eye sight is not what it used to be; scrolling takes an extra reading. I once ventured the course of paying for ALain's post. It was long and unrewarding. As I wrote there, I expected a more considerate attitude, e.g., in making the cost clear, either here, or on his own site. Alain's conduct was far from that. </p><p> </p><p>I am getting the impression that Alain simply enjoys annoying people in his posts and/or being rude and/or being inconsiderate, but perhaps I am wrong, and he would come up asking that he is given a section (paid or/not) for his posts.</p><p></p><hr>

Sure Wurm has final say and we should accept whatever the outcome is.  I may question his rules from time to time but I don't question his authority.  I would be crestfallen if this site were no more.  Still, I have to say, it pisses me off that some of these threads slip into anarchy.  My stated feeling is that deleting the aggression won't make it go away and if I were Wurm I would be open to helpful suggestions to put an end to it.  In my humble opinion it seems like it's time to develop a policy regarding the use of this site to promote the money making endeavors of others.  It doesn't bother some but bothers others.  It's the backwash of it all that bothers me.  What an unfortunate use of time - to wade through that just to get my daily eyescene fix. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2011, 15:47</p><p>Art, your view has no bearing on this site.  Wurm is the guy who runs it, and he is the only one who can decide what goes on here.  If he decides to allow Alain to post an update every day, he can do so.  If he decides that he no longer wants anyone to post links, he can do so.  If he decides that this post of mine is inappropriate he can delete it, like he did to yours. This is not a democratic website, and there is no majority rule.   </p><p> </p><p>The only thing we can do here is be very thankful that Wurm has gone to the effort over the past 15 years of providing this website for our use. </p><p> </p><p>So, please everybody, follow the rules as laid down by Wurm.   I would be very disappointed if this site disappeared forever. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Art</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2011, 15:21</p><p>I do not know what was deleted. My post disappeared. Anyway, it is my view that Alain should not be allowed to post ads disguised as real content..  </p><p> </p><p>Ads should be clearly marked as such, and placed in a clearly marked section. More importantly, I think we would all benefit if Alain is required to pay for these ads.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>pete</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2011, 10:21</p><p>Most of the time I would agree with that tactic but this time was different in that there were also some constructive suggestions being made regarding the inflamed issue of Alain, like SGS, selling on Eyescene.   </p><p> </p><p>I don't think that he quite gets that since he's now asking for money his status here has changed.  As I said, people are going to kick the tires and air their opinions.  When Alain acts arrogant, things escalate and get ugly.  Add to that the safety one can feel with internet anonymity and some really bad behavior can occur.  Deleting the posts doesn't make it go away.  [Take away the money aspect and it will.]  There were a few (now deleted) suggestions being made like allowing a seller such as  Alain to advertise here (maybe for a fee) and stay off the threads.  That way he can stand clear of criticism and the rest of us won't have to witness or become entangled in the resulting fray.   </p><p> </p><p>We've already seen how this plays out when there is no resolution, ie. SGS.  At the same there are examples of how well things can coexist on this site (probably due in a large part to sellers acting professional).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2011, 01:12</p><p>I used to let those things go on longer (at least sometimes) but on reflection I wasn't really happy with the result. So I've been a little more consistent about removing or otherwise discouraging this stuff during the last couple of years.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>pete</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2011, 23:55</p><p>Wurm. </p><p> </p><p>Regarding this post you made in Seen on the Web:  </p><p> </p><p> [Wurm 25 Feb 2011, 22:26    I deleted 10 posts due to a "flame war". There were a couple of posts that might have been OK, but they were orphaned when the others were deleted. </p><p> </p><p>Suggestions for new site policies and the like should go in Site Feedback and News.] </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Since you're open to suggestions, maybe it's worth just letting all that inflammation sit on the page for a while.  Deleting it so abruptly doesn't give many viewers a chance to see how 'stupid' we can be and maybe there is some value in that. </p><p>  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

A pince-nez had no arms or temples and clipped on the bridge of the nose. It was held in place by either spring powered nose guard grips in the fingerpiece type or a spring bridge with nose guard grips in the hoopspring or C bridge type. Properly fitted, a pince-nez remained securely attached to the bridge of the nose at all times and was very comfortable even during full time wear. Eyeglasses (pince-nez) and spectacles (glasses with temples) : were unisex then. The terms eyeglasses and spectacles had distinct meanings. The rimless type pince-nez was the most popular and stylish for all ages especially young people. For soldiers,it was great for wear under a gas mask or goggles and army officials stated the a pince-nez was the ideal eyewear.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>If you are a fan of eyewear history or have any curiosity or interest re: pince-nez please check out pincenez1.blogspot.com this is Pince-nez Renaissance blog/site the only place on the web or anywhere for very detailed,accurate info re: pince-nez. This unique site dispels the countless myths re: this perfect eyewear and is devoted to modern day wearing of pince-nez. Click on table of: contents. Many of the photos can be enlarged by clicking on them. Readers are encouraged to ask questions and submit photos. There is also an extensive guide on adjusting pince-nez.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, except for one exception, any makers of modern pince-nez are worthless..their product doesn't work, it doesn't stay in place because they failed to do research to discover what made the old type so successful some even show a pince-nez worn way down low blocking the airflow...  </p><p> </p><p>A pince-nez was ALWAYS made to be worn clipped on the bridge of the nose.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>See Flickr.com and search under pince-nez for 250+ photos and info  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2011, 14:41</p><p>Actually, I shouldn't encourage this sort of thing on Lenschat - I don't run the site and don't know what the policy is there if any. </p><p> </p><p>And Tom the Hungarian once ran a lesbian priest character, so he's already taken home the creative ES trolling trophy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2011, 14:32</p><p>The problem with just allowing people to run multiple characters is that a few people running a dozen characters each would soon overwhelm the seventy or so actual users of the site. </p><p> </p><p>If we assume all the British schoolgirls who have wandered through with their blurry, achy eyes are your creation, how many characters are you responsible for already? Nearly a dozen already, I think.  </p><p> </p><p>Tom the Hungarian ran maybe 30 characters or more. Bifocal Bill ran his own legions of British schoolgirls, all decked out in bifocals of course (you may be the return of Bifocal Bill, for all I know). Here in the US, Nancy had her crowd of dorm-mates with bifocals and wheelchairs and limbs falling off everywhere. </p><p> </p><p>I don't want all that fictional spice on my site; it has nothing to offer here. Keep it on Lenschat or write for a story site as Slit diplomatically suggested. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2011, 13:33</p><p>Slit - Thanks for the support/suggestion. </p><p>Wurm - If you don't believe me then that's your opinion. Nobody else minded or queried if I was real or not. </p><p>Surely if someone is posting stuff about glasses, they don't stray off-topic too much and don't insult other posters surely it is better to leave it rather than delete it. I would guess that most people here don't care if a poster is real or not and if they do care they will just skip future posts by that person. Deleting a post is denying everyone that choice. </p><p>I enjoy reading the posts and certainly don't care who is real and who isn't. For all I know everyone on here could be made up but that doesn't spoil my enjoyment. </p><p>I sound older because I am the youngest in my large family and have grown up with people a lot older than me. I also look and act older than my age.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Slit</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2011, 13:08</p><p>Hi Carrie, </p><p> </p><p>Anyways, you will do much better if you become GWG story writer, and perhaps will get published on bobby's site also. </p><p> </p><p>.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2011, 12:14</p><p>Usually trolls just disappear after posts are deleted, perhaps to return later under another name. This is a new twist. </p><p> </p><p>Your modus operandi of young girls with "achy" or "blurry" eyes is all over the place here. Another user was using the same IP and also had the old eye ache several months back. </p><p> </p><p>Also, your constant use of terms current in the 80s and 90s give you away as being much older than 17. </p><p> </p><p>Post after post of far-fetched personal tales are always suspicious. And yours went most decidedly over the top. Reading back through it the only wonder is that I didn't act sooner. What amazes me is that after going so far with this as to make up a story about insertion, you've decided to stand your ground. </p><p> </p><p>Finally, there is never any real background. These characters enter our little world with a prescription and a templated question. All we learn about them is whatever is needed to drive the stories forward. No depth of personality, no mundane activities, no real interest in others. Every friend is another glasses wearer who somehow fits the template. The contrast with real people on the site is stark. </p><p> </p><p>People have successfully run alternate personalities on this site, sometimes for years. But "Carrie" is not going to be one of them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2011, 07:50</p><p>Webmaster </p><p>I have just noticed that a couple of my recent posts have been removed and replaced with the message "post deleted - troll, multiple usernames" </p><p>I've only been posting on this site since September, not long after I got glasses. All the posts under the name of Carrie are mine (nobody else has "hijacked" my name and been posting stuff - I have checked)and I have not posted under any other name. </p><p>I could understand if a post had been removed if I had been sexually explicit (I know I was a bit descriptive a couple of times) but as we are all adults here (I may be 17 but I am legally an adult) and there is no access restriction to the "XXX Links" section I assume that is ok. </p><p>No hard feelings, if you stop deleting my posts. </p><p>Thanks </p><p>Carrie</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2010, 10:49</p><p>Julian, with no insult intended to guest, if you were yourself offering to do this, I would do it in a heartbeat, because I am familiar with you as a frequent poster.  But, I have no idea who guest is, or how long guest has been around. There have been a number of guest posters who were complete idiots, and while I do not think that this guest is one of them, I don't feel totally comfortable with someone I haven't known for a while. I do appreciate their kind offer, but I just wanted to explain where I am coming from, and why I am hesitant to jump on the bandwagon.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2010, 09:02</p><p>Yes, I agree with specs4ever &amp; Dieter; but note that what Guest offers is a *temporary* site till Bobby is back in action.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2010, 07:21</p><p>I have to admit that your offer is tempting guest, however I think I will wait a little longer for Bobby to come back.  Maybe someone else will give it a shot first.  Thanks for the thought</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2010, 12:21</p><p>I've deleted references to "stalking" since the term is vague and probably too inflammatory in this case. </p><p> </p><p>Also, thanks for the feedback and particularly for using this thread to discuss the matter.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2010, 12:08</p><p>I did spend some time considering what terminology to use. Other options such as "rabble rousing" have their own pluses and minuses. Cyberstalking has an unclear legal definition as it is, and is used informally and academically as well. Maybe I will just stick with "harassment" unless there is some sort of threat made. </p><p> </p><p>If this is a case of cyberstalking, it's thus far a mild one. Be that as it may, I don't want to see users driven off by disparaging replies to all or most of their posts. Shall we count up how many posts critical of AHMG's posts there have been already? I imagine it's a couple of dozen at least. Multiple usernames have been used to make these posts, creating an impression of a "movement" against AHMG and trying to drum up support. This may hurt his reputation and seems unethical to say the least. Is it possible that someone was caught up mistakenly in my effort? Certainly, and if so I apologize, but I believe the effort itself is quite defensible. </p><p> </p><p>If you have suggestions for the site, please put them here. I've said I will consider trying to wall off commercial posts, but frankly most people seem just fine with the odd post to a pay site as long is there is some free content to go with it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>pete</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2010, 11:03</p><p>Re:  legal point of view. </p><p> </p><p>I would like to weigh-in on this subject considering I was one whose anonymous post was deleted for stalking, harassment.  Honestly, my intention was not to stalk nor harass but merely meant as a conversational sigh of tiredness regarding the never-ending dribble of posts to an all-too-worn out off-subject subject.    </p><p> </p><p>Harassment is confrontational and there has been plenty of that here as of late.  Im grateful for Wurms effort to thwart this.  I understand the challenge he must face when drawing that line in the sand  which posts must go/which can stay. </p><p> </p><p>Ultimately, the challenge is ours  to act as caring members of a community.  There would be no need for policing if we each acted responsibly for our actions.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Legal Point of View</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2010, 07:07</p><p>Sorry part of my last post got cut off. </p><p> </p><p>But I wanted to say that I would just suggest deleting postings rather than trying to give a reason.  As a person running this board, you have every right to do so, and don't need to justify those resons to anyone.  It's much safer to simply do that rather than tread the mine waters when you start using terms that have legal, court-defined definitions.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Legal Point of View</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2010, 07:02</p><p>I've seen numerous postings deleted lately and suddenly citing the legal term "stalking."  I'm not sure you can label someone posting something controversial, and call the repeated criticism of those controversial items "stalking."  If the KKK were to post regular items here, would the constant backlash be called "stalking?"  If child pornographers started posting questionable pictures here and were criticized, would that be referred to as "stalking?"   </p><p> </p><p>Let's talk legally for a moment.  The definition of stalking involves at attempt to invade one's privacy and insert yourself personally into another individual's life.  Criticizing postings on a forum is FAR from meeting the legal definition of stalking and is simply expressing an opinion about another person.  If the person were to followup and attempt to seek that person outside of the forum, you would find that a viable case in court.  But if the same person posts repeatedly controversial things, and multiple individuals continually provide negative feedback, that is not stalking. </p><p> </p><p>Wurm is open to run a forum anyway he wishes, but I would suggest from a legal point of view, that unless you have a solid lawyer ready to defend your actions in court, you avoid terms like stalking and harassment which have SOLID legal definitions. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;05 May 2010, 13:31</p><p>Jules, "is going to reach up the capacity" does not mean we are full. It means I need to think on step forward. So, do not hesitate sending any text. BTW, the texts are small, the pix are the real problem. </p><p>I will change the name of the authors.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 May 2010, 13:24</p><p>Hi again Bobby. 'She thinks my spex are sexy' is by Marie alias All4Eyes; and Willy's song is by Willy. They were originally posted on EyeScene, and I added them to the Yahoo group 'glassesfetishfiction'. Rick, the founder, left me in charge of this group and I finally decided to close it down the other week. I have some other stuff from there for you, but I'm taking note of what you say about you site getting full!  </p><p>The links from Izzy's 'gayglassesfetishfiction' group have been lost too, as they were on geocities and that's no more!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;05 May 2010, 12:20</p><p>Julian, do you know the author? Who is it?  </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for your kind words. You know, some years ago, I decided to share my archive of the old Eyescene and VisionWorldForum with the others, and it was quite natural, to pick up the stories originally posted to the discussion and gather them in one place. And after a time (several years actually) the collection has grown to the size you know. The website is going to reach up the capacity so I need to think where to move it. It is 72 MB of data, and the website on my HD consists of 2100 files (more than half of them are technological files providing the ability to link everythig together, the smaller half of them are files with the stories of pictures) in 56 folders. Now, I am experimenting with another site where I could move the whole collection. </p><p>BTW does anybody know when I started the bobbygoc site? I have forgotten when it was.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 May 2010, 11:35</p><p>Yes, the two poems are not 'by Julian' so much as 'submitted by Julian' - I don't want to claim authorship of things I didn't actually write! But there's some great new fiction there. I agree: Bobby is great!</p><p></p><hr>

But, there are only a few authors that have written more than 1-2 stories. So we have to be patient. Anyway the stories on Bobby's site were written between 1998-2009 so it's a long period of time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2010, 14:44</p><p>Personally I think this site is magnificently run by Wurm and is absolutely not censorious. However, in a general way, Herbert's points about rule-makers and Thought Police are spot on....................you see, he knows what he is talking about as he - it appears - has lived under Communism................</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2010, 13:57</p><p>Good luck getting everyone on the Internet to ask about linking to sites before doing so. </p><p> </p><p>I'm just talking about the practicality of running a message board. It's ridiculously hard to police whether or not someone has gotten "permission" to link to a particular site before posting, which is why it will have to be "opt-out" (if someone doesn't like their pictures/blogs being linked to, they can take them down or make them private) rather than "opt-in," as you'd prefer. </p><p> </p><p>Personally, I don't think it's unethical to link to public websites without asking permission. They are public sites, meaning everyone can see them, and those who put them up should be aware of that. Just adding a "fetish" component to the linking website doesn't change that.</p><p></p><hr>

It's the people who decide what the internet looks like and how it works in the whole, and what this site looks like and how it works in particular. Especially there is no built-in module in the internet that scans for respectful and fair social interactions and prevents them as soon as it gets aware of it. ;) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SheepFormerlyKnownAsGuest</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2010, 13:11</p><p>Herbert, it's not about whether Eyescene is a fetish site: clearly it is one, although some times ago Wurm has closed all the fiction threads for the reason of while Eyescene still should be fetish friendly it should not be dominated by fetishism - sorry, if I recall the wording wrong, but I think this is what has been the essence of what was said then, many years ago. </p><p> </p><p>While not denying or accusing the fetish friendliness of Eyescene I've focused on the ethical aspect of having - or not having - the permission for re-contexting anyone's pictures into fetish-dominated "lots of links" or "a little less than lots of links" (also known as "seen on the web") threads. And getting this permission is what IMHO a respectful and fair treatment of people should be about - among others things, of course. </p><p> </p><p>If people are fine being linked here it's fine for all of us as well, if not we should accept and respect this. But it shouldn't be opt-out rather than opt-in, what means: ask first, post later. And if that would drop the number of links, so be it; the gain would be a much better reputation of this community in the glasses wearer's eyes! </p><p> </p><p>Furthermore, only because a picture or other file is published somewhere on the internet, it doesn't mean that it's legal to copy it or link to it without permission: being used as "fetish food" could hardly be considered "fair use". </p><p> </p><p>Lastly Herbert, of course we could continue this conversationn in german, but this would be equally rude against other readers as mass linking is against the people who are shown in those pics. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SheepFormerlyKnownAsGuest</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2010, 16:15</p><p>Herbert, the problem is that people (who are mostly completely unaware of the existence of glasses fetishism) don't like to be linked here into a fetish context. This could easily be seen many times when the linked pictures or movies were taken down within hours after the owner learned about being "victim" of a group of fetishists. An no, fetishism is not generally harmless as has been said before. IHMO a fetish that is related to something many people would love to get rid off (e.g., _strong_ glasses, if not glasses in general) is not harmless in so far as the "victims" have no choice to choose not to be targeted (cyberstalked). And this is why linking media files without the owner's permission is not Ok in the context of _this_ site, regardless of the fact, that they have published these files in their own context before. And by deleting their files as soon as they noticed they have been used for fetishism purposes, the owners themselves make a strong statement that they also think, it's not Ok. So it's not Ok, and Herbert and other mass posters should humbly accept this.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lidz</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2010, 05:44</p><p>This is just my opinion, but I think Herbert's mass youtube postings with no substantive comments are starting to turn "Seen on the Web" into the old "Lots of Links" again.   </p><p> </p><p>I appreciate the contributions but just mass posting videos of anything that breathes with glasses and no forward commentary is starting to get out of hand.  Seems I recall that's what killed the old "Lots of Links."  I understand the so-called language barrier argument, but I just read through two or three posts by Herbert in that topic which were well over 25 lines.  Asking for a bit more substance on the videos doesn't seem to incredibly painful, does it?   </p><p> </p><p>Again, this is just my opinion and I respect the contribtions, but is there anything that can be done about this?  Perhaps open a "Herbert's Lots of Links" category?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SZ6</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2010, 11:50</p><p>Chrisb, </p><p> </p><p>I strongly disagree with pretty much everything you said: </p><p> </p><p>- Eyescene is effectively a message board and online community. Countless online communities over the last 10+ years have implemented systems requiring user registration and passwords. This paradigm is mature and pretty well accepted all over the WWW. </p><p> </p><p>- I'm pretty sure that plenty of out-of-the-box message board solutions include things like automated password reset. You can also choose to let your web browser remember username/password information for any site you like. </p><p> </p><p>- I am not an Internet security expert, but everything I have ever been told about online security recommends that users NOT use the same password for each site they frequent. If you have only one password for everything, a criminal only needs to steal that one password to compromise your identity and gain access to all of your online information. Different passwords for each site you visit guard against this. </p><p> </p><p>- A small barrier to entry such as site registration would not deter the core users who have been visiting this site for over a decade. It has been through a few iterations since its inception, and dozens of regulars have stayed with it through each iteration. Needing to register won't change this, but it may prove to be enough of a barrier to entry to guard against trolling. </p><p> </p><p>To state the obvious - I am in favor of a registration system!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrisb</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2010, 11:32</p><p>I am against the idea of registration for the site itself, but I think it is necessary for a chat site. Eyescene itself is not a chat site. </p><p> </p><p>A user/password requirement would put a significant burden on wurm or there would need to be an automated password reset feature. Its also well understood that the more passwords you have the less secure they become. </p><p>Having to register would also deter both infrequent but regular posters like me who can never remember insecure passwords, but more importantly those very important visitors who come to the site honestly seeking information. </p><p> </p><p>registration is not even guaranteed to prevent the fakers. </p><p> </p><p>I think I posted a similar opinion last time the problem arose, sorry for repeating myself, but we the honest users of the site have to allow ourselves to be fooled occasionally and  develop a radar that spots the fakers.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I will see if I can find my 1998 post on this topic! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Apologies of I have misconstrued it. It was not a sycophantic response but the moderator of any message board that I have contributed to has gnerally come in for some flak at times regarding aspects of moderating. My response was related to that, with the final comment, if you are not aware, a phrase used at the end of the CD from which Wurm's "suggested phrase" is taken and which amused me to read. Granted it is off topic, and therefore why I have posted this response here. Are you suggesting that regardless of fakery, if it is is OO related it should be left, (as this comment was), but that anything that is not OO related should be deemed ripe for the moderator's trashcan?  </p><p>To reiterate, apologies if I have misinterpreted your post. </p><p>Best wishes</p><p></p><hr>

Every once in a while I get hit with a bunch of spam, so I block it for a while, but once you get me I'll put you on my "good" list.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2009, 12:59</p><p>Specs4ever, </p><p> </p><p>My stories come in exactly the same way.  Either the light bulb pops or I fiddle with something until it evolves.  I am flattered that you would even suggest collaborating with me but currently I have no idea for a sequel.  If something comes to mind, I will contact you.  Do you have an email address that you are willing to broadcast?  I dont, but Im sure we could exchange addresses via Bobby.  He has forwarded notes to me from readers. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2009, 18:25</p><p>Sorry Dieter, but I have had a number of other stories in the pipeline that had to get posted first.  I actually still have 18 more to go, and 2 or 3 that are in the final stages of writing, so we are looking at about a year before I manage to get the sequel posted.  And, I honestly have been giving it some thought, but I don't know how it is with you and your writing. Some people can take an idea , write a story plan, and then create a story, however I seem to have to toss the idea around in my mind for a while, and then all of a sudden the story jumps out at me. Unfortunately it hasn't done so yet.  But, I have another idea. I am quite fond of your work, so if you wanted to take a stab at writing the sequel, we could collaborate.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2009, 10:30</p><p>If it had just been the one "torture" video had had been posted, I'd just leave well enough alone. However, at this point I agree with Curious Too that it looks like the newer links are just being posted to piss off the people who don't like them -- they barely contain any glasses-related subject matter. </p><p> </p><p>Of course it is easy enough to stay away from something if you don't like it, but if people are deliberately posting things that they know will get other site visitors angry, that is another matter entirely. That's called trolling.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curious Too</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2009, 04:37</p><p>Easily offended?  Not quite.  Why was there such a controversy about the children pics wearing glasses?  Were those people just "easily offended" too? </p><p> </p><p>Violence against women is a very strong topic that raises alot of emotions; 99% of which have nothing to do with glasses.  Not only is assault wrong, it is blatantly illegal.  It's like "consensual rape" where there are just as many legal issues.  (Yes, I have a law background.) </p><p> </p><p>If there are people who enjoy viewing illegal acts, that's their choice.  But seems to me there is no reason why we can't separate the two. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2009, 20:45</p><p>Hey Wurm, I just read Curious's post, and I then HAD to go to XXXX to see what the squabble was.  As far as I am concerned I suggest that you leave things well enough alone, and everything will die down. Curious seems like the little boy at the peephole who complains when he sees someone naked.  I would suggest that he does what I do if he is offended, and stay away from that section.  Just my 2 cents worth.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curious Too</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2009, 08:02</p><p>Wurm...  I am growing increasingly concerned over the amount of videos showing intense violence being committed against women that are being posted in the XXX links thread.   </p><p> </p><p>While I realize that everyone has their own pleasure, these links are highly offensive to some - including myself - as much as the child pictures being posted in other threads earlier.  These videos have extremely little to nothing to do with glasses and are simply being posted regularly to offend those complaining about their presence. </p><p> </p><p>My recommendation is that a new thread be created called "BDSM" or something like that so this individual can continue to post their content without regularly offending the women who visit the site as well as myself. </p><p> </p><p>I appreciate your consideration of this, Wurm.  Thank you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2009, 05:06</p><p>Hi Onlooker, I think you have to discuss it with her again or it will sit and fester!  Her problem is she sees it as something bad when actually it is no big thing at all.  Some men like big breasts, others like long legs and we like glasses.  Maybe you should try to turn it from being a thing about glasses to being a thing about how sexy she looks in glasses.  I know it's difficult to explain how it makes you feel.  Just now she feels threatened by it, she is a bit scared because she does not understand how it makes you feel.  Try to help her feel comfortable and accept you as you are.  Good luck!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>OnLooker</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2009, 03:54</p><p>Thanks Spexxieman, but i don't think it's useful to approach my wife now and to discuss the matter further as she's over-reacting to this. She's still not wearing her glasses at all. Yesterday she made a comment on smoething on the computer screen saying "this thing is giving me pain in my eyes". I didn't even comment on that but i felt it was meant for me to go and bring her glasses as usual. The thing is that i'm off doing that as long as she thinks i'm only doing it for my own pleasure and satisfaction.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;27 Aug 2009, 19:19</p><p>  Onlooker, As with alot of fetishes, they don't tend to be very logical but are still quite powerful. Trying to figure out why or "what's wrong with me, this isn't a normal male reaction" may or may not help you to understand this attraction to women wearing glasses and possibly help your wife to understand &amp; embrace this as a positive thing. I questioned this feeling since high school &amp; have yet to nail it down. Reguardless of an explaination it is very real &amp; as I have learned thru this &amp; other sites on the net quite common. Normal??? What is normal???  By being up front with your wife about your infatuation may not seem the right thing to do now but probably would have been much worse the longer you tried to hide it from her. I have been lucky in the fact that my wife knows , accepts &amp; particapates, without fully understanding the glasses turn on.  </p><p>   Maybe you will be able to have a less emotional disscussion with your wife soon to help her to understand "your feelings" and embrace it. Reguardless. you are not alone in this "girls with glasses fetish", Good Luck.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>OnLooker</b>&nbsp;27 Aug 2009, 01:27</p><p>I would like to thank all of you in here for the opportunity you're all offering each other to discuss our o-o cherished matters. I'm sufferring from misinterpretation and incomprehension of my liking of women with glasses. My wife knows about it since a long while and she hates it. Of late i made a terrible mistake telling her that i am happy she has now to wear glasses... She had a a rage against me and then told i can't understand this fetishism of yours and yours fantasms on women with glasses. Since that moment she has just stopped wearing her +1 glasses (she's hyperope). I see her eyes straining in front of the computer and while reading stuff but she's stoutly resisting not to show herself as dependent on glasses. I don't know why i thought it would be OK to tell her that... Now i am refraining from even sugegsting her to wear her glasses like i used to do when i saw her eyes straining..I simply decided to ignore the matter altogether until further developments...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stan</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2009, 13:59</p><p>p.s. About the keratoconus, I think that most of us who have wished for high myopia would agree that the problem (?) with that disease, even if it were bottled and sold to us, is that the irregular cornea makes good vision difficult even with correction. Speaking for myself anyway, even my "fantasy vision" would have to be correctable.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stan</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2009, 13:55</p><p>Bobby, I find that the language tools on Google are quite good and I am able to participate to some degree in a couple forums that are not in English, the only language I know. Perhaps your photographer friend would be able to use those tools to participate in EyeScene. </p><p> </p><p>I never saw your web site before today but I was immediatey drawn to your messgage to Guest. I took a look around some of the recent ES posts for the "lecture" you referred to but did not find it. Is it still online? I don't want to get you updet by reminding you of it, whatever it was, but I'm just curious what that person said to get your dander up. </p><p> </p><p>Have a good day.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2009, 11:50</p><p>To Galileo: Yes, he did. </p><p>To Gwgs: See this link <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815103109/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus</a>  </p><p>it describes a disease that cause this high myopia.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2009, 08:57</p><p>Lentifan and others  - I too have corresponded with someone who had suffered a disease in her early teenage years and she said her myopia has short through the roof her since then. I think it has stabilised now where she has an eye exam every year and it may increase by a diopter or two but this is nothing compared with her teenage years. There was no cure for this and nothing to help stabilise the consistent growths either. </p><p> </p><p>She must be in her 30's now and from my last correspondence with her a few months ago she was -24.5. She told me that her myopia wouldn't stop increasing, her several months she would find her glasses would be to weak for her and she would have to go back for another eye exam and then new lenses etc. </p><p> </p><p>I too didn't think to ask what the disease was - it may sound rather cruel but I wish they could bottle it and sell it though!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2009, 05:12</p><p>Hi Bobby, I'm not a regular visitor to your site, but happened to go there today.  I guess "Guest" really upset you! :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2009, 18:04</p><p>I do not know what diease it is. Misiak, the photographer, mentioned a kind of disease or syndrome in the phone call. Sorry, I cannot remember the name. I did not ask about any details as it did not seem to me to be unbecoming to ask too much. The photographer suffered the injury in 2001 when he was racing a fast motor boat.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2009, 16:46</p><p>I loved the photos of Barbara in your update, Bobby.

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2009, 12:57</p><p>If you could understand Slovak (the TV station is from the Slovak Republic), you would get to know that the photographer's  eyes started worsening after an injury. He does not do GOC. I exchanged several e-mails with him during the last two monthes and spoke to him by phone today. He would like to take part in our discussion, however he never leart English. (He told me he has started his lessons recently.) </p><p>The model suffers from a kind of disease since her early childhood a side effect of which is severe nearsightedness. She definately does not wear GOC. </p><p>I hope the photographer will share some more pictures of Barbara in the future.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>russell</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2008, 13:40</p><p>Thanks, Wurm, for removing the posts on the Actors thread.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>russell</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2008, 07:30</p><p>I, too, feel that the posting of the links was not a deliberate ploy to post porn.  I think that the links were either posted forgetting that they contained porn or thinking that the porn would not be offensive.  I'm saying that I found it offensive and would like future posters to think before posting. (And I think the offending posts should be removed by our esteemed site administrator.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2008, 06:36</p><p>I don't think that misplaced link was deliberate on the part of the poster.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cut-in UK</b>&nbsp;13 Dec 2008, 23:56</p><p>Well said, russell. I totally agree with what you say. I am not against porn in another place, and for those who enjoy it. The argument, for me, is about quality and the focus of this site. </p><p>The problem is this is a site for glasses enthusiasts, and the porn understandably and invariably focuses on "the act" rather than the glasses. It sidelines the eyewear and also annoys me that at least half the lenses are plano or ill-fitting  'readers'. There is nothing worse than a pretty girl in cheap and nasty glasses being less than tastefully portrayed as a victim.  If it bores me, what must it do to the many optically-erudite lady contributors to this site.  </p><p>A little discerning self-censorship wouldn't be out of place. It would demonstrate that O-O's appreciate a level of quality and relevance.(I notice that many of these postings are anonymous; another telling fact about the care and selection process !) </p><p>I've bored you all now. Apologies, but no regrets.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>russell</b>&nbsp;13 Dec 2008, 14:09</p><p>I suppose this is the right place for a comment of this nature, since this thread is for site feedback.  Here's my concern:  On the ACTORS thread, three links to pictures of actor Hugh Laurie were posted.  The problem is that the links are to porn sites that then lead to the pictures.  I don't visit Eyescene for porn, and, in fact, I try to avoid pornographic sites.  It bothers me that these links were posted on Eyescene, for there are all sorts of people who view these boards, and some may be offended, as I was.  I realize that there are sometimes links to U-tube videos that are "adult" in nature, but U-tube has a warning and requires a password to view these.  The links to the pics of Hugh Laurie gave no warnings at all that they were porno links. I have no objection to anyone who wishes to (and freely chooses to) view pornography. But I don't think that Eyescene is the place for it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2008, 18:07</p><p>I've been reading the stories too. </p><p> </p><p>glassesforeveryone - I once had an idea about a mermaid who was high myopic out of water (and presumably magically equipped with legs too) </p><p>but like a lot of ideas, no time. </p><p> </p><p>Dieter - liked the Peyton story and the Sarah story. </p><p> </p><p>Glad to see we're getting away from the lists of prescriptions. I tend to avoid precise presciptions in my tales because they get in the way of the story... anyway I prefer stories about the effects of glasses, poor vision, etc. </p><p> </p><p>Still struggling on with Dear Diary VI. It's got lots of squinting in it. </p><p>Some odd stuff. Kirsty dreams a lot.  </p><p>Someone from the past. More squinting. </p><p>Louise gets a new girlfriend. etc etc </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2008, 12:19</p><p>Slit, </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for the kind words and the suggestions.  I had never considered a continuation to Peyton's story . . . . . until now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Slit</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2008, 08:59</p><p>Dieter, </p><p> </p><p>This is a very special congratulations for your growing skill in developing nice glasses stories, especially addressing audience of plus glasses and multifocal category. </p><p> </p><p>Fantastic Friday was fantastic with nice plot and smooth introduction of the glasses in to the story... I believe this story will have more episodes coming up, such as how Peyton deals with glasses and her active lifestyle, about the new admirers she has got as well as how her life evolves with relationships and family etc. </p><p> </p><p>Wish you the best! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2008, 03:49</p><p>Wow, fantastic follow up. I've been waiting for this for awhile and it did not disappoint! I think it's a truer "Glasses story" than many of the -40D ones we've had recently. </p><p> </p><p>I've finally started drifting away from ES, it's very dry compared to the Fantasy Optical days that I remember...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2008, 10:04</p><p>Yeah, frankly I prefer the stories that don't get too far into technical details about eyesight (amounting to a lot of reciting of prescriptions) or far-fetched plots about rapidly-increasing myopia and -20 Rxes. </p><p> </p><p>This one is down-to-earth, believable, and has likable characters. Nicely done!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2008, 09:06</p><p>Yes, I loved the rest of the Sarah story too. Not *quite* sure why Bobby thought it wasn't O-O enough; the glasses are pretty pivotal to the plot. But what the heck, we owe him so much for maintaining that great collection of glasses fiction, who can criticize?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2008, 13:10</p><p>Glassesforeveryone, </p><p> </p><p>Can I just say that I loved the second part of the Sarah story, I think I love her. </p><p> </p><p>I don't want to spoil it, but it really moved me - a really sad story.  Not sure why Bobby rejected it but I don't mind as I loved it! </p><p> </p><p>Keep em coming!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter G </b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2008, 08:30</p><p>To Bobby and the avid story writers - thank you very much for all your efforts and contributions.

Please keep the stories coming in, I certainly enjoy them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glassesforeveryone</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2008, 01:45</p><p>Hi Guest, </p><p> </p><p>I did write a follow-up story to Sarah's story, but this was the story that Bobby rejected on the grounds of not being OO enough. </p><p> </p><p>I have found a blogging website where I have managed to post this. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815103109/http://clearblogs.com/glassesforeveryone/176386/Sarah%26%23039%3Bs+Story+2.html" target="_blank">http://clearblogs.com/glassesforeveryone/176386/Sarah%26%23039%3Bs+Story+2.html</a>  </p><p> </p><p>So, you can read the story which was 'Banned by Bobby!' [apologies for the blatant sensationalising there]. </p><p> </p><p>Glasses is very much a core part of the story, but it is not the heart of the story.  If you enjoyed the first Sarah story then you should enjoy this one. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2008, 19:12</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>glassesforeveryone - wonderful story!! BTW, a myope swimming underwater without goggles oftentimes experiences clearer vision since the water pressure can flatten the cornea just a bit thereby lessening one's myopia.  I'm a -2 and notice the phenomenon.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2008, 18:09</p><p>I received the e-mail with Dieter's story on 21st Nov, late night, actually 10 minutes to midnight (CET), and I opened the file next morning. When I was reading the Logan's Obsession for the first time, I was literally biting my nails. So similar the story is to my own personal history (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815103109/http://bobbygoc.sweb.cz/texts/about_me.htm)." target="_blank">http://bobbygoc.sweb.cz/texts/about_me.htm).</a>  </p><p>I am sure many of us can identify with the Deiter's text.

<p><b>Pete</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2008, 14:57</p><p>I cannot believe how Logan's Story completely mirors all my own bizarre (at the time)thoughts, fears, feelings and actions as a young man growing up a total Optic Obsesive. Sounds as though there are many among us with similar operational views as young O~O's.... </p><p>Strangly compforting and yet weird that ive never acctually been able to find anyone with the same O~O background - face to face during my whole life - ive only ever discussed it on here.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2008, 12:10</p><p>Yes, I have. A man from my country visited Eyescene regularly few years ago, contacted me and me met several times as we live in the same town. Two years ago I met a man who liked the stories that are translated into Czech on my website. We met once n pub near my place. Actually he does not read Eyescene because he cannot read English. One of my former girlfriends knows Eyescene (I showed it to her) and probably visits it from time to time. My present GF knows I read Eyescene every day, ut I do not know how often she checks what I write here. Plus! I have a neighbour who is glasses fetishist for 90%, I would like to speak about the issue and show him Eyescene, but I have not been with him to a pub yet (he goes to a pub to another neighbourhood, I donno to which one). However, is English is poor. </p><p>So, having this topic here, I call: </p><p>JSOU TADY NEJAKY CESI? PROSTE MI NAPISTE NA MAIL. ZADNEJ PROBLEM.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2008, 06:54</p><p>Andy, </p><p> </p><p>Now you have me thinking of Steve Martin's Grandmother's Song - "be obsequious, purple, and clairvoyant" - and way off topic.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andy</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2008, 04:16</p><p>Dieter this is going to be a difficult story  according to  the definition on Wikipedia. </p><p> </p><p>A sycophant (from the Greek &#963;&#965;&#954;&#959;&#966;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#951;&#962; sykophánt&#275;s) is a servile person who, acting in his or her own self interest, attempts to win favor by flattering one or more influential persons, with an undertone that these actions are executed at the cost of his or her own personal pride, principles, and peer respect. Such a manner is called obsequiousness. </p><p>In ancient Greece the word was the Athenian counterpart of the Roman delator, a public informer. In modern Greek the term has retained its ancient classical meaning, and is still used to describe a slanderer or a calumniator. </p><p> </p><p>In Obert Skye's Leven Thumps series of children's books, "sycophant" also refers to a race of small furry creatures whose job is to aid people who have entered Foo. </p><p>Alan the Sycophant was a bit character in the comic strip Dilbert by Scott Adams. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glassesforeveryone</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2008, 08:00</p><p>I should have said indistinguishable from a lot of GOOD novels!  I read what I'd written again and my comments certainly had a double meaning.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2008, 10:15</p><p>PS any Sarah's out there? I'm practically in love with her at this point ;)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2008, 09:43</p><p>That story by GlassesForEveryone is amazing. Ive been getting a bit tired/jaded of the latest round of stories but that one is my new favourite. All the little details like Sarah being unable to see outside of her glasses and her gradual progression, not of her prescription but her adaptation to her glasses really make the story stand out. The only thing I'm disappointed by is Becca's character being too quick to change, you would think she would know better but anyway I hope there is a sequel. Now Becca needs her come uppance. Maybe she'll get an eye infection  and not be able to tolerate contacts anymore, wonder what her new "friends" will think of her then. Sarah could get a larger frame that hold better and give her more peripheral vision and make a comeback :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2008, 12:08</p><p>Wurm! Been about 10 years here myself! And about 6 (if I remember right), since we all met up in Disney World with you and SG.

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2008, 11:35</p><p>I remember first finding this site, and what a thrill it was to discover others as odd as (and in some cases substantially odder than) I.  I am far more of a lurker now than anything else, and I tend to take this site for granted, but I hope that it never disappears.   </p><p> </p><p>Cheers and thanks to Wurm, Julian, and all the other old (and new) members.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2008, 11:29</p><p>still: I think you are talking about sci.med.vision...it is still there, but has a couple of resident jerks (some joker named Zetsu and another named Otis Brown, who seems to be Bates reincarnated).  I check it every once in a while, but it is more flame wars than anything. </p><p> </p><p>I've been here since mid-1997, and was thrilled to find out that other people were as interested in glasses and vision as I was. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>still</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2008, 10:21</p><p>Just to add my bit, since I was away from my computer: I can't remember the first time I visited Eyescene - like some others I started looking for eye-related material in the 90's, maybe 1995, and there was a site for discussion of eye-related issues, sci.med. something-or-other, which I visited regularly. And then there was Eyescene, and that's where I stayed. Thanks, Chris, for all this...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2008, 08:22</p><p>Thanks for all the kind words about the site. It's especially gratifying to hear from people who have been visiting for many years. </p><p> </p><p>I can't offer a "how I found this site" story, but I do remember searching for glasses content using the old Gopher (pre-Web) search engine! And I vividly remember the first few days of the 'polls' comment system here: puzzling through my first lines of code in Perl and then hoping there would be enough traffic to make the effort worthwhile. The polls format was inspired by a polls themed 'room' I administered on a university BBS system in the early 1990s.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2008, 18:15</p><p>I also came on board about 6 months after the original Eyescene started.  I had run across postings by Wurm, Neuro Joe, Filthy and a girl named Jennifer on Deja News, and was extremely pleased to see thta I wasn't the only one with a penchant for GWG's.  It took me a while before I found Eyescene, but once I found it I was hooked. </p><p>There were a fair number of people that were posting fictional stories as real, and I remember being very disappointed when the Jennifer mentioned above turned out to be an Internet personna.  </p><p>I started writing soem fistional stories myself, and I sent them off to a few other readers, such as Lenslover, who had started a website of his own(the old Smudge Report)  He posted some of my stories, and eventually Wurm provided a venue for authors on Eyescene. But the writings section took up too much bandwidth, so fortunately Bobby was able to give all of us budding writers a home.  I would like to thank Lenslover, Wurm, and Bobby for their assistance, because when I started there was no decent glasses wearers fiction to be found. </p><p>And maybe there still isn't, cause I think I am a large number of those hits Bobby. I can't resist going in to read my stories again, even though they are all filed on my computer. There is just something special about going to a website to read stuff :). </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2008, 17:22</p><p>Oh but I do remember spending a full weekend with my jaw dropped that such a place even existed and reading non stop till my eyes got watery and blurry :) </p><p> </p><p>It was mainly this site that got me to go for a proper eye test convinced I was myopic. I was also secretly thrilled that I might get an rx for it, as I'd almost flunked a school eye test when I was a kid on account of my (then) minor astigmatism that I was able to quickly guess correctly through.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2008, 16:47</p><p>Hey y'all, I'm working on a novel right now, not the one I asked for advice on somewhere here, but another one. It's not all that ambitious I guess you'd say, just a story about a family reunion, but with a few twists, and I'm hoping it might even be made into a movie someday. There are 31 characters so far and I'm thinking I'd like to name as many as I can after my friends here at Eyescene. Here's who I've got so far: </p><p>Bobby Laurel </p><p>Chris Mitchell </p><p>Julian </p><p>Pete (AKA EHPC) </p><p>Phil </p><p>Claire </p><p>Dave Smith (Specs4Ever's name, don't you know) </p><p>VFL (this was a toughie, but I've decided a character will have VFL as her initials and be called a nickname based on them, pronounced "Viffle" (rhymes with wiffle &amp; sniffle) </p><p>Katy </p><p>Sandy </p><p>CJ (for Cactus Jack) </p><p>Susanne </p><p>Caitlin </p><p>I'd like to include LikeGlass, Electra, Filthy McNasty, Puffin, Daffy and some others, but can't think up good names to use for them. If I've got your name on this list and you don't want it to be in the book, or you want to know what "your character" (although I'm really not basing the characters on the people they're named after, just using the names) will be like (in order to use all the names I have now, some of the characters will have to be kids or deceased relatives referred to only in memories), or if your name isn't on my list and you want it to be in the book (I'll do the best I can, but no promises, I can only add so many characters! Though I guess I could include some pets, if nobody minds having a puppy or a parakeet named after them!), please email me at southern_starshine (at) yahoo (dot) com and let me know. P.S. As a nod to reality and an indulgence of my OO, most of the characters will wear glasses. Let me know if you have a preference for "your character's" rx. If this does ever become a movie, I'm going to make sure the actors and actresses wear real glasses, too! </p><p> </p><p>I ALWAYS make passes at guys who wear glasses, Marie </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2008, 15:56</p><p>Oh, Specs4Ever, I do hope you don't stop writing! I know you've done so many stories already, and I understand it can get tough to constantly think up new angles to write from on the same basic topic (glasses and vision problems), but your stories are SO GOOD and as you say nobody else seems to be writing now. I mean, I do love to write (check my most recent post to Going Without Glasses thread) but I don't think I can single-handedly keep the glasses stories torch burning! </p><p> </p><p>I ALWAYS make passes at guys who wear glasses, Marie</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2008, 12:20</p><p>Hey lazysiow, I would be more than happy to have you send me any ideas you might have for stories. Andy has sent me quite a few, and I have taken his ideas, and for the most part have turned them into good stories.  Now I won't guarantee that I can make every idea into a story, but sometimes all it takes is an idea, and the idea can gell in my mind for a while. Then all of a sudden I find that I am creating characters, and a story is coming together.  In some cases I have had a story stalled, partially written on my computer for ages and ages, unable to continue past a certain point. Then for some unknown reason an idea comes to me and I am able to finish it.  What is even funnier is when I get a story to a point where I can go no further, and I go back to it, and back to it, trying to carry it forward to copmpletion.  Then I read it again, and with the simple addition of a paragraph, or a few changes in the body of the story I realize that the story is already finished. </p><p> </p><p>I did not make any of my previous comments to draw out words of encouragement, however I thank those who have commented. </p><p> </p><p>My e mail is specs4ever@yahoo.com, and I definitely give anyone who sends me an idea credit for their part.  I also send them the finished story, for their approval well before it ever appears in print.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2008, 05:30</p><p>As you can see Wednesday 5th March and Thursday 6th march show a large number of Page Views. By comparing with the internal statistic data from the Sweb.cz I found out it was caused by a single user. All I can reveal about him is: The person is from the state of New York, USA and he is connected via Optimum Online Company.  I think he is a newcomer, who discovered the site and kept cliking and reading a lot of the pages. He made 2.81% of all accesses since the beginning of March. You can see  a large number of "Returning visitors" (the green bar) on Wednesday, I am sure it was him. A situation like this happens about once a year only.  </p><p>Sometimes, looking at the statistics, I ask myself: For heavens sake, who are the readers?  </p><p>I last tested the IPs by entering the them into the Whois.com in mid February. Most visitors are from the US, about 1/5  of them, then Germany, UK, followed by other EU countries. However there are visitors from all continents.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2008, 04:58</p><p>1. Do people really read the stories? </p><p>Yes, they do. The website has a new feature, which you will find at the bottom left corner of the initioal page, it is the Bravenet Free Counter. Look at the number. Now it is 10,620 accesses since the beginning of February. Click the "VIEW SITE STATS" to see last 7 days.  </p><p>2. I get about 1 or 2 e-mails a month with some feedback. It is always positive. </p><p>3. I can access another statistics, I am provided with by Sweb.cz server. It shows which pages are most visited. Believe me, the stories are really read and I am sure they are enjoyed too. The pix are popular too. </p><p>4. Specs4ever, do not stop writing. Your stories are real the classic style of the genre!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2008, 00:44</p><p>I think I might be able to help here. Ive had ideas for lots of glasses related stories, but no time to write. If I'm lucky I get to write up a premise or treatment. Usually mine are of epic variety and to date Ive only ever actually written one which I posted on ES years ago but never finished. It was probably too long for most people too. </p><p> </p><p>I'll see if I can drop you an email if your website's email is still current when I can dig/write some of these up.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2008, 23:38</p><p>S4E: I hate the idea of your source of stories drying up; I'm lost in admiration for the amazing variety of your ideas. Having written a few stories myself (and still trying to) I recognize that in some cases I've just taken an idea from another writer and given it a gay slant. You don't fall into that trap. A long as you can find a story to write, I'll be eager to read it!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2008, 18:43</p><p>Thanks Dave. Unfortunately I am going to have to stop, or wind down sometime. I have been doing my best to come up with 2 stories a month for Bobby, to make his updates more interesting.  So far I have managed, but the ideas are getting harder and harder to come by. I have been hoping that some other writers would step in to fill my shoes, but Puffin no longer seems to have time to write, and no one, other than All4eyes really manages to come up with any..</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aussie Dave</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2008, 17:28</p><p>Hey Specs4ever </p><p> </p><p>Love your stories. Please never stop writing them</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2008, 16:38</p><p>Thanks for the words of encouragement.  A pat on the back does help from time to time. </p><p> </p><p>Funny, but I had never noticed the connection between myopic fathers and myopic children. I have seen far more mothers who wore glasses that passed the myopic genes to their daughters.  Now you will have me looking at the fathers as well, although it is known that any myopic parent increases the chance of the child being myopic.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2008, 21:51</p><p>Specs4ever - my observations have indicated that myopia seems to pass down the male line more often than the female, so I'm not altogether surprised that your inspiration's children don't wear glasses. However, I am yet to meet a myopic father whose children do not become so! </p><p>I would guess that the best test of her claim would be whether or not her father wore glasses. In the cases I mentioned, neither did - so I believed their assertion (even at the age of 11 I had spotted the genetic connection!) </p><p>Do keep up the good work - I agree that your stories are the best out there!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2008, 20:33</p><p>You can bet we do read them!  I personally start watching Bobby's site on the first of each month, just can't wait for the new updates to show up. </p><p> </p><p>S4E, yours are the best GWG stries our there.  Keep'em comin'.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2008, 18:05</p><p>Hey Tim, the idea for that story came from a lady I knew in real life who had a -29OD and -28OS prescription. She had suffered from a serious fever when she was 2 years old, and she claimed that the virus caused her eyesight to go.  She had 2 children, and neither child wore glasses, so I suspected that her story might be true. </p><p> </p><p>Actually, I am glad to see that you made a comment.  Now that the storys are posted on Bobby's site there never seems to be any feedback, so I sometimes wonder if anyone still reads them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2008, 09:49</p><p>Thanks very much for your suggestion, JC. My life has already been enriched by the experience here in many different ways. Your enthusiasm is reward enough, really. But I will add your suggestion to my short list of ideas for the future.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JC</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2008, 22:46</p><p>Wurm: </p><p> </p><p>In response to the news about Optical4Less I would like to take a moment to thank you for all the work and resources you have put into maintain this site for over 10 years. </p><p> </p><p>May I suggest that you set up a PayPal donation program so that those of us that would like to contribute to this site may do so?  I imagine that the appearance of commercialization of this site is something you would try to avoid -- perhaps you could place this option in some unobtrusive location?  I for one would be honored with an opportunity to support this great site in some small way.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2008, 22:00</p><p>BTW, Bobby, I can't get in to Mishiak's pix. Is the link not working?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2008, 21:56</p><p>Specs4ever's new story, Viral Myopia, may not be as fanciful as one might think. Way back in the 50's, I remember two boys at my prep school who had been told that their eyesight had been ruined by measles. In those days it was the accepted wisdom that measles constituted a risk to the eyes, and it was common practice to keep the patient in a darkened room while counselling against the use of the eyes. </p><p>These two lads had both disobeyed their doctors' orders, and had been reading by torchlight under the bedclothes. Result - at 11 they both had significant prescriptions (I had no idea of it at the time, but would now guess about -3) and were probably well on the way to becoming high myopes. I have not seen either of them for 50 years or so, so I don't know where they ended up! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2008, 16:07</p><p>I just want to take a moment to thank Optical4Less for their sponsorship of Eye Scene over the past four years or so. I get the impression that Albert, who I had been working with there, may have left or is taking some time off. </p><p> </p><p>I may try other sponsorship or revenue opportunities, but for now I look forward to reverting back to hobby mode. I'm taking the ads down now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2008, 17:23</p><p>I just looked at my story file, and found some half-written bits and pieces and some odd ideas I jotted down.

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;16 Jan 2008, 23:36</p><p>Re the recent post in Induced Myopia. I like the idea of a dating site for O-Os, but do not think that a new thread on this site would do.

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2008, 10:34</p><p>There was an article about the glasses fetish some years ago. It existed unchanged for about a year. Later the link to the Eyescene was removed, as some members of the Eyescene community thought is was better not to have the link there. The article as it was originally written (well, with some minor changes) disappeared from English Wikipedia between the years 2003-2006. I do not know who deleted it or who chnged the article so much that it was some time later included into this article:  </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815103109/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garment_fetishism" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garment_fetishism</a> </p><p> </p><p>IMHO I doubt there is any sense in creating an article about glasses fetish again as Wiki community seem not to be able to accept such an article. I belive it would be included into an article about other fetishes again. Well, look for yourself and study the history of the only remaining article.</p><p></p><hr>

Also, to "guest" below, all chats these days (AOL, MSN, etc) are recorded and the user IPs are logged. It's just part of the society we live in, and has become somewhat universal.

<p><b>OttO</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2007, 17:28</p><p>Wurm:  I don't see that it's been mentioned, but one feature EyeScene lacks, which is found on the sample board below is a SEARCH feature.  While not fool proof , it sure would be nice to have.  Some might find that more useful than the stats.</p><p></p><hr>

I agree that some click stats would be nice to have. They probably would work well on the recent threads page, as you suggest. The thread index is another option (I've always found that view a little bland anyway). I may look into using a simple table so all the info will be readable. </p><p> </p><p>Of course, I haven't been logging this all along, so it would have to be "thread views since January 1" or a daily average or something.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glowworm</b>&nbsp;16 Jul 2007, 16:19</p><p>Wurm, look </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815103109/http://katharinefans.com/Forums/tabid/92/view/topics/forumid/24/Default.aspx" target="_blank">http://katharinefans.com/Forums/tabid/92/view/topics/forumid/24/Default.aspx</a> </p><p> </p><p>In the "Views" column you can see for each thread how often it has been clicked. At Eye Scene, the "Thread Index" page seems appropriate for numbers like this, perhaps the "Threads by Most Recent Post" page (my favourite ES "entry point") too. </p><p> </p><p>Whether it is possible to create something like views per day - I don't know. But even "ongoing" views statistics for the threads would be quite interesting imho.</p><p></p><hr>

I usually stay clear of this myspace crap but it's got video chat integrated and is fairly easy to use. I signed up for it to talk to a friend but I noticed that we could probably make a chatroom there and password protect with something that only we'd know.  </p><p> </p><p>On one hand it would be better than Lenschat. We could see each other's glasses for one lol and we'd be able to skip a lot of the usual "what's your RX?" and "do you have glasses pics?" on Lenschat. On the other hand though, maybe for some the anonymity is better and the mental pictures people have built up of each other would be shattered. </p><p> </p><p>It's worth considering anyway, anyone up for a trial?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes to JC</b>&nbsp;10 May 2007, 15:12</p><p>Hi great to hear from someone with the same rx (though I'm overdue for an eye exam and am hoping to get one soon, having a bit of trouble with long distances with my current glasses (which also have a temple piece missing 8-( ), so I may not be a minus four that much longer (or so I hope!) ). It's also nice to hear that I make you smile (hearing that makes me smile! 8-) ). Thanks for the compliments, I must admit it is relatively easy to be honest about such things with the sense of anonymity the Internet provides. I don't talk about this stuff with anyone I know in real life, though I am considering giving it a try. I sometimes think how sad it is that so many of us feel more comfortable sharing the deepest, most personal parts of ourselves with total strangers this way than we do with our near and dear ones, the ones who should know us best. I'm hoping that one day OO will become more widely recognized by the general public and that we will all be able to "come out" and openly enjoy our hobby/obssession/fetish/fascination. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever fan</b>&nbsp;07 May 2007, 05:07</p><p>Hi Specs4ever </p><p> </p><p>I appreciate all that you say. I was more thinking along the lines of a strong glasses wearer who likes to go "bareeyed" (as Susanne DK might say), either for her own gratification or for that of a prospective or actual partner. I remember a comment on eyescene many many years ago, from an English lady called Sarah (I think) who although around -18, would take her glasses off at parties to please her boyfriend. She actually enjoyed experiencing her blurry world from time to time.  </p><p>I suppose what I hope for is an extended version of that post which you turn into a wonderful story.  </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, rest assured, whatever you choose to write, I will be greatful to read </p><p> </p><p>Kind regards </p><p> </p><p>Specs4ever fan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;06 May 2007, 19:42</p><p>Hey Specs4ever Fan I appreciate your comments.  However, while I do not like to write stories about people taking someones glasses, leaving them helpless, I have written a number of stories where the glasses are broken, and the lady has to cope without correction.  Some of the stories that come to mind are: The Blur of The West; Annie Bagley, After The Outing, Blindly Shanghaied, Pinup Girls, The Poker Player, The Survivor, and The Kidnapping.  And there is also Too Proud To See about a young lady who badly needes glasses, but refuses to accept charity. </p><p> </p><p>And, there will be others along the same lines in the future.  But, I do draw the line at a story where someone is controling a person who needs strong glasses, even though Shanghaied is sort of like that.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;08 May 2006, 10:59</p><p>Re: ChrisB's story </p><p>I like the story very much and I hope there will be at least one more part of it, in spite of ÃÂ¨my liking it I cannot make ChrisB write and send another part as it is against my principles. (I think, the best stories are those written without any pressure put on the suthor.) Let us wait, and let us not hesitate to say: "ChrisB, we like your work!"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;08 May 2006, 06:05</p><p>Specs4ever, </p><p> </p><p>It's ok to use the same story idea &amp; title. As for completing it, I'm not sure that's ever going to be possible - my version is a bit of a monster. I have plot lines ready but can't seem to get the time and inclination to finish it. Anyway I'm busy writing something else completely different (non-glasses). One day, I'll get back to Kirsty &amp; co.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;08 May 2006, 03:10</p><p>Bobby - that latest story by ChrisB was really great. The way it was left I assume there is a follow-up - can you persuade ChrisB to get it online for us ?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;07 May 2006, 16:49</p><p>Puffin, I noticed your comment about the fact that you also have a story about a girls diary.

Some of the things here and on the linked sites are a little "out there" compared to how I feel. and we O.O.s kind of have our own lingo here that would be hard for someone else to understand. Btw, I had a voice chat with him the other day and I told him he had the "myopic personality" (intelligent, bookish, introverted-in short, a nerd)-which he does-and he laughed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2006, 15:12</p><p>Me too! I remember when I first found it, about 18 months ago, I stayed up all night reading every thread. I couldn't believe that there were other people out there that had a glasses fetish - I had always thought it was just me, and never really talked to anyone about it - I thought it was too strange. Thanks to this site and Electra's, I am so much more confident about the whole thing - my close friends know about it, my boyfriend describes himself as a 'trainee OO', and I wear my glasses, which I was always too shy to do.

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2006, 12:22</p><p>All right, it seems Elektra's site has not been updated for such a long time we can easily say she (or he?) is gone. If you want send all the "man in glasses" stories stright of gay to me and I will create a new section(s) on my web site and upload them. If I am the man whÃÂ¶ can create the largest collection of the stories of the kind I must be the one.

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2006, 06:57</p><p>Good idea - those stories are brilliant. I have some printed out but I'll save all of them just in case. I don't know how the Geocities sites work - whether or not you have to keep logging in to keep them going.  </p><p> </p><p>It is strange - even though quite a few of my offline friends know about my glasses thing, I haven't told them about Eyescene. I suppose I don't want them to read everything I have written. My boyfriend has a look though - whenever he comes up to the computer this where I am! :-)</p><p></p><hr>

I continued sending her material till the end of August, but it was never posted and she never replied. I guess if she's around and interested she'll see these posts and can get in touch. </p><p>Might be as well to salvage the text of some of the stories on her site; it would be a shame to lose all that material if the site closes down without warning. </p><p>One of the problems of the medium: as they say on the internet nobody knows you're a dog, and we all value our anonymity or rather pseudonymity - but if you - or I - or Electra - fell under a bus tomorrow, who would be any the wiser? My offline friends don't know that I'm Julian... </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2006, 05:08</p><p>Has anyone heard anything from Electra? It is nearly a year since her site was updated and now her hotmail address doesn't work.

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2005, 04:39</p><p>Bobby, thanks, but now I have my site back up, after a fashion, I think it'll be OK. BTW I am writing as fast as I can!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2005, 04:06</p><p>Lentifan, you are obviously a real lenti fan. I will try to make some new morphs in January. </p><p>Puffin, Specs4ever's stories are a real classic of the genre. My offer to host some of your stories is still available.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2005, 17:57</p><p>Yes, thankyou from me too, really liked the extra thick glasses, made me laugh to see them so thick, but, oh, what if they were real?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2005, 16:10</p><p>Bobby </p><p>I've just seen your update.  Your new morphs are great fun and, as usual, specs4ever's stories are first class.  Something new every time, even if, thankfully, there's a common and much appreciated thread! </p><p>I specially liked the first 2 morphs in the second row - just the sort of lenses my dream parner would wear.  And I should mention, too, your first ('Various') morphs page; the girl in the leftmost picture in the bottom row looks quite delightful.  You've perfectly captured that 'slitty' look myopic eyes often have behind strong minus lenses. </p><p>A Merry Christmas to you and S4e, and thank you once again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby's web site updated)</b>&nbsp;12 Dec 2005, 15:10</p><p>Hi all readers and fans of S4E's stories. </p><p>I updated my website. It is the late December update as well as Xmas update, because there is a new story by Specs4ever "The Christmas Present". You will find one more story by him in his section and 15 crazy morphs in "Thick like hell" section.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fred</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2005, 10:16</p><p>Hi Emily, </p><p>Actually, it is alive and kicking, but perhaps you have the same problems as I have. I can only reach it by using a proxy. For example go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815103109/http://anonymouse.ws/" target="_blank">http://anonymouse.ws/</a> and try to reach lenschat from there. I'm not sure what is wrong, but at least this works.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2005, 06:03</p><p>What has happened to Lenschat?  It's been down for 4 or 5 days.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fred</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2005, 15:04</p><p>Tammy, thanks for your solution! Since it was quite some time ago that I posted the problem I did not expect any answer to my problems anymore... All of a sudden it worked again, but at the moment I don't have much time to chat, unfortunately. Another solution I found was just to circumvent the problem by visting the site using a anonymouse proxy. It also worked, but made the chat very slow. Hope to meet you in the chat soon!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2005, 15:38</p><p>Fred, </p><p>I wanted to let you know that the reason i worded my last post the way i did was because i don't know how much you know about computers. You may be an expert, i don't know, but it's nobody's business but your own, so don't tell us. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2005, 18:50</p><p>Fred, this is only a suggestion, and i don't really mean to talk down to you, but have you deleted your cookies and cleared your browser history lately? That seems to work for me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2005, 07:05</p><p>Sorry if anyone is out there hoping for an update on my site, life has been a bit too tangled recently.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2005, 17:11</p><p>bobbygoc.sweb.cz has been updated. 2 new stories by S4E.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2005, 09:18</p><p>I have ordered from O4L and had no problems.  Albert was communicative and helpful.  Wurm, I think, has made a good choice of sponsors, especially in light of the benefit O4L has been to those of us with this strange fascination for the lens. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>still</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2005, 11:31</p><p>Congratulations, Wurm! The ad is understated and stylish, and I guess I will get used to it after a bit. Anyway, my point is that this site is of such high quality that I'm surprised an advertiser hasn't found it sooner.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2005, 17:35</p><p>Hummm... Interesting thought Julian. I must admit I was more inclined to pop into chat in the old days. Now, when you sign in, you feel obligated to say something. It would be cool if people could just hang (or lurk) and then maybe sign in if they wanted to join the conversation.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mimi</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2005, 14:33</p><p>Just wanted to let everyone know that InStyle magazine has a little feature on eyeglasses. They talk about different frame style and have pictures of a variety of spectacles and a couple of actresses sporting their spces. Check it out, it's the October edition with Sarah Jessica Parker on the cover.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wei</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2005, 11:25</p><p>Thank you Patrick B, Puffin and Stuart. </p><p> </p><p>Patrick B explain better than I the problem of high myopic!  Low rx, yes is not so good as 20/20 but problem is small i think.  High myopic give many difficulty which not understand well.  I try not post too much now </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2005, 08:39</p><p>Also consider that there are many human ailments that cannot be altered or improved by the equivalent of simply putting on a pair of glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2005, 08:01</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jennifer, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for clearing the air!  Your son will learn to cope with his myopia just as certainly as your husband has.  I didn't start wearing glasses (-3) until I was seven, but friends of mine have a son who started at age four with, I believe, a -4.  He's now eight and is a -6.  They're hoping that his growth years won't accelerate his myopic progression, but they've been told that it will be pretty likely. </p><p> </p><p>Hope your son enjoys his glasses.  I took to my first ones like a fish to water.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stuart  </b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2005, 15:46</p><p>Well put Puffin and Patrick B.  </p><p> </p><p>I really think it is very simple -if you don't like what people are posting- don't read it. I wish my Chinese was as good as Wei's English!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2005, 14:06</p><p>Patrick B: </p><p> </p><p>Sorry if you misunderstood my intentions.  I am married to a high myope and face the prospect of my son getting glasses at a very early age.  I do understand, but my husband has learned to cope as best as he can. Although I am not in his shoes, I do understand the struggles he goes through every day.  Having said that, I feel that we should all respect each other regardless of what prescription we have.  We are all wear glasses and must deal with the ups and downs on a daily basis.  My apologies to Wei if he took it the wrong way.  My prescription may not be as high as his, but I too feel that it's very hard for me to function without glasses.  Sorry again for the misunderstanding.  I was just trying to say that a "lucky" person is someone who doesn't need glasses at all.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2005, 17:00</p><p>I for one have no problem with Wei. Carry on posting, there are many things to be said about glasses, we should all listen to what people have to say, even if we don't agree with them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Moonshiner</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2005, 14:10</p><p>Thank you Wurm, I'm tired of derogatory comments as well. Nobody is forcing anyone to read any of the posts, if you don't like them, don't read them.  </p><p> </p><p>Wei I am curious, If you don't mind, What country are you in?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815103109/http://eyescene.net/bbs/es/real.html" target="_blank">Wurm</a></b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2005, 11:07</p><p>Everyone has spoken their peace about Wei's rather logorrheic posting style. Please note that I won't continue to tolerate a mob mentality.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2005, 10:58</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jennifer, </p><p> </p><p>You obviously don't have a clue about life as a high myope. (Why don't you also check my response to Jim in the Guys in Glasses thread). Wei isn't being patronizing or condescending, and I find it astounding that the likes of you can't give him a break for his English.  Anyway, for starters, being a high myope means never (and I do mean never) enjoying full 20/20 vision with glasses.  For some, that means not being able to drive, enjoy television viewing comfortably and any number of life's normal activities.  It also means wearing thick, heavy glasses (and I mean glass lenses not plastic) with all of the problems of distortion and minimification.  In some extreme cases it means wearing myodisc lenses which restrict one's viewing field.  It also can mean having a different pair of glasses to read, one for the computer and one for distance.  Why?  Because bi/trifocal lenses aren't available in myodisc lenses with their small viewing areas.  Some extreme myopes also carry small pocket telescopes to view bus numbers or whatever.  Sometimes I think I should have one myself but can't bear the thought. </p><p> </p><p>Being a low myope has its drawbacks, but it just ain't the same as being a high myope. It's like complaining to an insulin-dependent diabetic that you have it so rough because your diabetes is controllable through diet.  Not the same kettle of fish at all.</p><p></p><hr>

I've thought of providing some abbreviated or hashed version of the IP address. And the one user per address idea is certainly worthy of consideration. However, it's good to keep in mind that a fair percentage of people still use services that share IP addresses and/or assign a new IP each time the user logs in. Given the fuzziness of the information, it might cause more harm than good. </p><p> </p><p>I've pondered other solutions, such as simply charging for access and providing each paid user a single login. But I've always liked the relatively open and freeform environment here and don't mind doing a certain amount of manual administration in order to retain it. A more likely next step would be to offer review/deletion tools to a few moderators (like the old UBB we had up previously).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DWV</b>&nbsp;26 Aug 2005, 12:20</p><p>So, how difficult would it be to flag posts which use a different name than had been previously associated with that IP?   </p><p>Or maybe you could display, if not the IP, then some number that is derived from and unique to that IP. </p><p>In case my intent is not obvious, I think this might discourage people from posting under multiple personas.  </p><p></p><hr>

I know that one of my old stories is now on Bobby's website but I'm trying to track down two other stories I wrote, in particular one about a girl who found out she needed glasses and then happened to meet two really cute bespectacled guys who happened to be brothers. I can;t even remember what it was called, but I have no copy of it myself and would really like to read it again! Sounds mad, doesn't it? If anyone has any idea if it is floating around somewhere, it would be great if you could let me know! Thanks, P. x</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;14 May 2005, 20:18</p><p>I saw the movie "Kicking and Screaming" tonight, and it's about soccer of all things. Anyway, there's a scene in it when the soccer coach realizes that his goalie can't see very well, so he turns to the parents and grabs all of the parents's eyeglasses off them, and runs to the kid that's having trouble seeing, and holds the glasses up to the kids eyes one pair at a time, and asks "Can you see better or worse with these and then after about 3 pairs the kid says that he can see better with the glasses. The coach puts these huge black frames on this kid and the kid smiles as they start to play soccer again. That's the end of the glasses scene, but i just laughed and laughed, since i knew that sounded so OO to me! The rest of the movie was good too. Take care, Tammy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2005, 17:22</p><p>TC, maybe it's time to dust off and revamp the original HTML version of lenschat. Sure it was primitive, but nothing can touch it for bandwidth efficiency! The current system php code wedge is loaded whenever someone drops in and clocks against your bandwidth usage. The result is that 95% of bandwidth usage is support systems, and only 5% is actual chat. Just a thought.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2005, 15:08</p><p>I finally made it into the new Lenschat.   Thanks for your help!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2005, 12:16</p><p>The common theme seems to be the AOL browser.   I shall see if I can work out how to try something else.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gremlin</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2005, 12:21</p><p>Katy, Melyssa: </p><p> </p><p>   Thanks for the information on how to get past the sign in screen for Lens Chat, or even how to successfully post a message here on EyeScene BBS. After several weeks of being completely shut out from both forums, I decided that my computer memory or hard drive was causing the problem.  </p><p> </p><p>   This was not the case at all. At your suggestion, I tried using Internet Explorer. I.E. provides quick and effective access. My AOL browser simply does not let me connect to either posting page at all. It worked several months ago, but it does not work now. I have switched to I.E.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>still</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2005, 11:42</p><p>Whatever you decide, Puffin, we value what you've done, and your presence here. Will you be leaving your site on-line, or taking it off, and, if so, when? Will you continue to be a member of this group? Any way, thank you for all the pleasure you've shared here...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2005, 04:32</p><p>It is with great sadness that I must announce that I am going to have to close my site. It must be obvious to those who have seen it that I haven't been doing much on it recently. Finding spare time in the last few months has been just about impossible. It's not that I'm short on ideas for stories - I've got a whole list. The main thing is that I've got no time to look for decent glasses pictures. They seem to be getting harder and harder to find. </p><p> </p><p>I shall put up whatever photos I have in February, and that will be it. </p><p>Sorry, I did my best, and it was fun, but I've had to admit defeat. :( </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2005, 08:45</p><p>Electra - assuming you can read this though you can't post - are you ever going to post those photos I sent you for Julian's Gallery? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2005, 04:41</p><p>Andrew, </p><p> </p><p>You can also use Netscape 7.0 or greater.  I use that a lot more than I.E.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2005, 14:05</p><p>Andrew - are you using a recent version of Internet Explorer? Changing to that worked for me - I was having the same problem, and I was using the AOL browser.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2005, 13:59</p><p>I still cannot get past the log-in screen to the new lens chat.   Any advice, please, as I feel I am losing touch with the regulars on the old format!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Buddy</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2005, 05:59</p><p>What I like the best about eyescene is when people write in and discuss their visual history.  I certainly enjoy reading about their progression from a mild prescription to a strong prescription with emphasis on the eye test and the results.  I think a new thread such as "Eye History" should be set up.  I am sure others are just as much interested in this as I was.  I was hoping Julie would post more, but that suddenly stopped leaving us wondering.  So something along those lines would be nice.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Socks</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2005, 23:44</p><p>I was just thinking that it would be nice if there was a particular place on here to post "diary" type entries like Emily had done that has since been erased.  Julie also had several diary type stories that stopped, as have a couple of others in various random places.  I like reading those memories of getting glasses and the progression of prescriptions.  Emily's was nice to read every few months and I wish it would have been continued.  Any thoughts?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-oo-</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2004, 17:24</p><p>so what was the outcome, katy?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2004, 16:53</p><p>Andrew - I was doing that today with the optician - had to go because my eye was hurting like mad and looked very evil. I was saying things like 'its on the white bit' - and I've done half a year of an optometry course! Anyway she said 'I'm afraid we'll have to do a full eye test' (he he).. luckily I had thought to wear my old glasses instead of the too-strong ones because she took them away to see how strong they were - that could have been very embarrassing :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2004, 12:44</p><p>"trying to talk about glasses with someone without sounding just a little too interested or knowledgeable..." </p><p> </p><p>I think this must be one of the hardest things for those of us who have been around here for a while.   I can talk about what it's like to be shortsighted from my own experience, but I can also talk about being longsighted, having astigmatism, bi-focals, prisms etc. from what I have read.   It's quite a challenge, but it does enable me to ask questions with a vague idea of the response before I've heard it.   I think it's the part where I ask about the prescription which might give me away as an OO... </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2004, 07:14</p><p>Jules - here are some random things you might use for your story (no pressure!): </p><p> </p><p>- the experience of being told you need glasses even tho it seems like you have perfect vision (your eyes just get tired when you work too much, right?) </p><p> </p><p>- not getting +glasses even tho you really need them. </p><p> </p><p>- contemplating the idea of wearing +glasses all the time even tho you can function well without them at all, and wondering if it would potentially ruin your eyesight (and possibly not caring) </p><p> </p><p>- what it feels like when you first get +glasses, the oddness of seeing distance out of focus, the woozy feeling, the oddness of seeing everything bigger. </p><p> </p><p>- an almost sensation of 3-D (because things are sharp up to mid distance, and then suddenly falls into blur - much like the old kiddy 3-d viewers. </p><p> </p><p>- the panic you feel when you see your glasses - on the table in the optical shop, and on your face. worries about what people will think, that they will think you are "old" even if you are quite young. </p><p> </p><p>- feelings of concern that getting glasses and changing the way you see might change the way you are, or the way you work - especially if you are a visual artist. </p><p> </p><p>- the secret glee you feel when you start to notice other people with +glasses. </p><p> </p><p>- descriptions of how the lenses distort the side of ones face when someone sees you wearing them, and how they distort images in the distance behind you when soeone sees you wearing them. </p><p> </p><p>- that freaky light triangle that gets projected when light falls on them (so you see the shadow of the person wearing them with this bright refractive spike of light pointing to the eye of the shadow caster. </p><p> </p><p>- what it feels like to slowly be able to see in the distance of new +glasses. </p><p> </p><p>- threats of bifocals. </p><p> </p><p>- what drives one to seek an eye exam? </p><p> </p><p>- the experience of switching to strong +glasses after wearing contacts for a long time, then suddenly showing up in strong glasses. </p><p> </p><p>- trying to talk about glasses with someone without sounding just a little too interested or knowledgeable... </p><p> </p><p>- the realization that your are wearing glasses all the time, and can no longer read without them. </p><p> </p><p>- that sort of "excited" feeling you get when you put them on. </p><p> </p><p>that's all I can think of right now - hth. looking forward to your new story. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2004, 07:54</p><p>Syd - I remember Alexa (or Alex@) Julie and O - who were there almost full-time when I first found Lens Chat. Have to say I'm a very irregular visitor these days.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2004, 06:23</p><p>Electra can't post for some reason.

I can't imagine why the system would refer to you as Pete... I checked the database and no Tod is registered so you might want to try it again.   </p><p> </p><p>The system is honestly not complicated for most users.  Register once, log in with your nickname and password and chat away, no complexities at all if you don't want them.  It has extra features (colors, etc) but you don't need ot use any of them if you don't desire. </p><p> </p><p>Also, anyone who has any suggestions for a PHP/MySQL chat client they like better feel free to let me know or set up your own server.  I set this up just to fill the need and for many users it seems to fit the bill nicely. </p><p> </p><p>I do have the same software as Rusty Hinge also, but most folks seem to much prefer the new software.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;04 Nov 2004, 19:35</p><p>Looks like it's working now. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;04 Nov 2004, 17:25</p><p>TC, your new lens chat is just too complicated for the average ES user. This includes me, too. I have tried several times to post with the name Tod and your system continues to refer to me as Pete.  </p><p>We need a new chat room. So if you or someone else can put up one that's easy for everyone to use this would be great. </p><p>I also think Wurm should put the old Rusty Hinge back up. Sure there are idiots out there who abuse things. It happens everyday in all endeavors of life. But you don't throw the baby out with the bath water! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;04 Nov 2004, 14:47</p><p>I'm registered, but I can't get into it.   I'm also no expert on computers, so any guidance would be most appreciated!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2004, 07:12</p><p>Thanks TC, I have got it to work now - I was using the AOL browser before and that didn't work, but when I tried it with Internet Explorer it was fine. Can't wait to chat to everyone again :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>TC</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2004, 06:36</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815103109/http://www.lenschat.com/" target="_blank">http://www.lenschat.com/</a> </p><p> </p><p>My appologies to Katy and Christy, I'm not really sure what the problem might be. </p><p> </p><p>We've got 35 registered users so far and I've talked with many of them without problems.  What you might try is making sure you have a decently updated browser, make sure Javascript is turned on, and make sure your security settings aren't turned up too high.  Also, the site uses "pop-up" windows for the registration and displaying user profiles, make sure your "pop-up blocker" doesn't block them. </p><p> </p><p>Let me know if you continue having troubles with it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2004, 03:08</p><p>TC, thanks for setting that up - am really missing lens chat! I am probably doing something stupid but evry time I type a message it sends me back to the login page. Any ideas? I have registered with a password. Thanks! Katy :)</p><p></p><hr>

I have now turned on the requirement to register before chatting.  Feel free to use your usual chat nickname, and remain as anonymous as you'd like with the name fields, etc. </p><p> </p><p>At this point I am *not* requiring a valid e-mail address for registration, as soon as we start having problems with abuse again e-mail addresses will be required for registration.  They won't be made public or ever spammed, just used to slow down abuse. </p><p> </p><p>Also, be sure to check out the "Tutorial" file, it has a great "ignore" function, if everyone ignores the abuser they would quickly get bored.  Help new visitors how to use the ignore feature.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JB</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2004, 22:09</p><p>TC </p><p>Nice work, glad to see a new chat set up.Let us hope that it is only populated by the majority of decent genuine people who will migrate from Wurm's site.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2004, 18:05</p><p>It seems that Wurm has removed the Lens Chat chat room also know as the Rusty Hinge from this web site. It is unfortnate that a few unthinking indivduals have ruined things for the many who are responsable. I only can hope that Lens Chat will be restored soon with perhaps some form of user registration. I am not however in favor of mass punishment or banning as this only serves to empower the wrong doer in the long run.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2004, 12:22</p><p>Good Job TC!  It loads behind a firewall, without requiring Java. Looks like a stable solid code. Anyone can enter, but people who register are acknowledged. Nice handy URL, clean screen... What more could we want!  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Well, i hope an alternate way can be found to restart it. I am not sure if this would work or not, but a yahoo group could be started as everyone would need to log in and the moderator of the group can also limit/restrict membership to the group.

<p><b>JB</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2004, 22:14</p><p>Sadly it seems as if the imposters and non genuine nonames,there were some very genuine nonames who were always affable and interesting but decided for thier own reasons not to let the rest of us know who they were,have won and chat has been closed. </p><p>Maybe Wurm will have a change of heart and reinstate the facility in  time. </p><p>One thought....maybe on of the regular chatters could administrate the room on Wurms behalf.I would gladly put myself forward for this but i have no experience of these things and would therefore not have a clue how to start. </p><p>Anyone have any realistic workable ideas ? </p><p>I know i was relatively new to the chat but i can see how a lot of you are missing it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2004, 07:27</p><p>I would not read quite as much into chat being down. It may very well be a server glitch. Chris does have a life and may very well have not seen it, or had the chance to address the problem. It could also be that it is not that high on the priority list, or he is simply on the road or otherwise occupied.

<p><b>Lady Eddy</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2004, 15:23</p><p>I am very sad to have to inform you all of the passing six weeks ago at our home on the New South Wales Central Coast of Edward Lu Baoli known to you as Eddy. He was 76. </p><p>Eddy lived a long full and varied life. He was a diplomat, politician and in his later life financier. He wrote profusely on the many subjects which interested him including history, literature and politics. He was an incredible linguist. Even he didn't know how many languages he spoke. I only recall him being at a loss once; during a trip to Mongolia, but he soon resolved the problem in German and Russian. </p><p>Eddy told me about what he called his "little weakness" very early in the piece. He loved Eyescene. I still remember his excitement when he found it. He very specially asked me to tell you all that he wouldn't be coming back. </p><p>Eddy was a very traditional Chinese which means that he is survived by three other wives beside myself and thirty children and grandchildren in several countries. We all miss him sadly.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2004, 17:52</p><p>The ease of joining in the posts on this site has likely brought quite a number of real people in over the past couple of years.  So, any form of registration would have to be fast, and probably annonymous in order for others to drop by.  It seems that the regular forum has very few problems on an ongoing basis - the odd flame war, but nothing serious.  However, the chat is another story, and as someone said is contaminated about 50% of the time.  I have tried to ignore no names in the past, but then what they do is adopt the name of whoever you are speaking to, and then the filth starts.  So, they have made it impossible to ignore them.   I know that the posibility is there that the person I am chatting with is not who and what they claim to be, but I don't have a problem with that as long as the conversation is pleasant, and clean. </p><p> </p><p>So, whatever you can do to help this problem disappear would be fantastic Wurm</p><p></p><hr>

On the one hand, it seems like it's no big deal and everyone should know the risk of imposters is very high. On the other hand, I know from the various iterations of ES we've been through, Wurm does not like this site to be used as a tool for weirdos (beyond the OO type I mean).  </p><p> </p><p>I went in the lens chat a week or so ago and somebody, apparently male weirdo, was trying to get somebody else, presumably young female, to follow him to another chat site but I think she said the other site did not work for her (it was a Java chat applet). I followed his instructions to get to the site, typed in the girl's nickname, exchanged a couple sentences, and he did not seem real happy when I explained it was me and not her. Not very friendly about it at all. More like a guy who thought he had one on the hook but then found out it was really just a glob of seaweed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2004, 11:53</p><p>STORY ABOUT A PENCIL NECK NERDÃÂ&nbsp;31 Jul 2004, 08:07 </p><p> </p><p>I'll tell you what a nerd is. A nerd is someone who steals a fellow student's car at school in order to go home to get his homework that he said he forgot to bring with him to school. The stolen vehicle was a red 1963 International Harvester Scout. He started the car that day with a pair of scissors. Because this person previously found a spare set of keys in the vehicle and drove the car days before without permission. But a passenger then, afterwards turned the hidden spare set of keys over to the car's owner and advising her that someone might try to steal the car. So the next time the pencil neck nerd was in the car he goes and starts it up with a pair of  scissors he finds under the front seat. He somehow starts the ignition with these scissors. He steals this car with a passenger inside because he suddenly "realizes" he has left his school paper at home and now has to go home and get it. Anyway, he gets into an accident while driving to his house. First, when rounding a corner he clips the side of a parked car and stalls the stolen car. He then nervously attempts to restart the engine using the pair of scissors in the ignition. He finally restarts the engine, pops the clutch and immediately crashes the vehicle into another parked car on the other side of the street. The person sitting in the passenger seat is thrown through the windshield and is knocked unconscious and has a lacerated forehead and neck. The driver who is the thief, gets his knee cap smashed into the steering column and has to be hospitalized for surgery to have his knee cap wired back together. Both had to go to court afterwards, where as the driver admitted in court that stealing the car was his idea alone and charges against the passenger were dropped. Yes! Only a REAL nerd would steal a car to go fetch his forgotten homework paper. This is a true story that happened on Nov. 6,1969. (zip code 12550) The thief's name was James Federicks. The girl's car he stole as well as the other cars damaged by him, cost several thousand dollars to repair. The thief got five years probation as a juvenile offender.</p><p></p><hr>

My mother told me I was -9 at that age and went to several eye specialists. Today I wear high index lenses of -22 and -22.75. Without my glasses, I see just a blur of colors. I can't make out any shapes. With my glasses, my vision is 20/30 and 20/40 which is pretty good for how nearsighted I am. My glasses are very thick ene though they are high index. They are concave in the front. I have had myo-bowl or disk lenses but they look rediculous on me.I am 31 now and live in Wyoming. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2004, 07:05</p><p>The first (historical !) meeting of glassses fans in Europe took place on Saturday 3rd April 2004 in Brno, Czech Republic! The group was small, there were only three participants. Me (Bobby), Nekva, and Mike (who has never visited Eye Scene for he cannot speak English). We talked about glasses, wearing GOC, girls and guys with glasses, we discusses prices and various combinations of spherical and cylindrical diopters, prisms. The other topics were also: paraphilia generally, sexual orientation, different kinds of fetishes and ways how to bring more glasses fans into our national internet discussion group in Czech. Nekva brought his amazing collection of glasses and a testing set, so we also tested our eyes. We enjoyed the meeting so much that we forgot to have dinner. A thing that is almost unbelievable, as Czechs are known as big eaters. :-) </p><p>We hope next time we will have the chance to share our thoughts and ideas with our frineds from neighbouring countries too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aliena</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2004, 09:07</p><p>Dear Chris, </p><p>  </p><p>I think that it is too bad that you had to put a 600-word limit on the stories submitted to the fiction section of EyeScene.  I understand that it was due to a single saboteur that posted long amounts of nonsense and disrupted things.  I do think that the Fiction thread on EyeScene was a good feature and there were several interesting stories posted.  I posted 3 myself.  I also think that many people made favorable comments and there were several people that read the stories and probably enjoyed them, but did not comment.  I just reread the story by Amy that was posted on "Fantasy Optical" and I then reread some others posted on the Fiction Thread.  Being someone that has had to wear strong glasses all of my life, I thought the stories brought a sympathetic view to those of us in this category and also gave interest to many others. </p><p>  </p><p>It seems that something is now missing on EyeScene.  Is it not possible to reopen the fiction section as it was before, with no word limits? </p><p>  </p><p>Best wishes, </p><p>  </p><p>Aliena </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;05 Jan 2004, 07:46</p><p>Hi Ash. If you were blocked, it would probablly be site-wide, and as you are able to post here, that is not the case. Lens Chat uses an HTLM frames format which requires realtime updates off of the server. Some ISP's cue pages and this can cause the problem that you are discribing. When you post, the text file on the server is updated, and a new version of the page is sent. Often these problems are just bottle-necks that come and go on the internet. If it keeps up for a few days, then there is a problem.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Old Lurker</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2003, 12:37</p><p>i have been lurking and reading this website for many years now and have seen the different versions that have worked and not worked.  It seems to me that last time we went to a password system, the number of postings dropped off dramatically and the board became boring very quickly.  Yes, the fakes were gone, but so was the fun. </p><p> </p><p>The question that we must ask is how important is it to have names anyway?  As Bob points out, they will all be fake ones.  And I'm sure there are alot of people pretending to be others out there, but what's the harm?  You should come to expect that on the Internet.  I don't care if someone makes up an exciting situation that we all enjoy because that's what makes this site fun.  Are they really telling the truth? </p><p> </p><p>Bottom line: If you make a formal registration process, you will lose users again.  It happened before, it will happen again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2003, 00:58</p><p>Bob: the system on the previous EyeScene BBS was that you could post without registering, but under your name was the word 'unregistered'. Other possibilities were 'junior member', 'member', 'moderator' and 'administrator' (that was Wurm as we now call him). </p><p>That meant that you could tell whether a post in the name of a registered member, and that was most of the regulars, was genuine. I don't think it worked in the chat though, but no doubt something could be done about that. I dread the thought of another re-hash though, with possible loss of all the posts! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2003, 21:31</p><p>I think having to use a password to use this site would be a mistake. For one thing, I am not organized enough to keep up with one more user name and password.  </p><p>Second, I have always thought some of the most interesting posts were from people who accidentally stumbled on this site who shared their experiences and feelings about wearing glasses. Most of them would not fool with trying to set up a user name and password. I know some of these posts have probably been fakes, but I don't understand why anyone would care. </p><p>This is the Internet. Nothing is real here. None of us are using our real names and for all anyone knows we could all be bored 72-year-old women making it all up.  </p><p>I think if you set it up with passwords and user names, you are going to end up with a click of about 20 serious glasses geeks, but lose just about everybody else. I think the site will soon lose much of what to me makes it fun. </p><p></p><hr>

I recently thought of one. I'm sure this will be met by opposition, but i hope that we can keep the flaming of this post to zero, but i feel that we should have to register our names that we use on the threads and also on the chat, since there are so many imposters these days, and also some of the NoNames that come around are really rude. I'm not saying that all of them are, but only some of them. I feel that this feature would get rid of the imposters and the spamming of the boards and the chat. Just think about it, ok?

<p><b>Pippa</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2003, 05:53</p><p>I feel I must comment on myopia during pregnancies. My sister-in-law had perfect vision until she was 4 months pregnant with my nephew and her vision started to get worse, (she was 19), when she was 5 months pregnant she had to get herself some glasses (sorry, don't know what the rx was),she has worn glasses ever since. I asked her  whether she blamed her eyesight problems on her pregnancy and she said yes, her optometrist told her that pregnancy can affect a woman's eyesight. She also said that it deteriorated with her second pregnancy. Maybe if affects different people in different ways.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andy</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2003, 22:44</p><p>Oscar, she wanted the abortion because her eyedoc has warned her not to have the baby because of the serious risc to become blind.

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2003, 09:45</p><p>Andy - just one other question about this very striking young woman (to me she's beautiful - and it's only a pity that the programme was on a subject where it would be unlikely to see her smile) - did she want the abortion because of fears for her own sight (i.e. becoming blind) or for the baby's? I'm assuming you saw the programme. The website for the TV company seem to have almost all of yesterday's broadcasts archived except this one - how frustrating...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andy</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2003, 04:53</p><p>Sorry I forgot to mention that they also said that her prescription was -25D.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andy</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2003, 04:50</p><p>Puffin, S4E, Lore, Yesterday there was a report on TV about abortion on in Poland. They had an interview with a young mother who had a big increase in myopia during pregnancy. Her doctor refused an abortion against her eye doctors advice. I have some screencaps of her under: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815103109/http://www.g-w-g.de/parsi/Alicja01.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.g-w-g.de/parsi/Alicja01.jpg</a> There are several more pictures if you change the number in the file name from 01 up to 07. I try to find out more. </p><p> </p><p>Andy</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2003, 03:10</p><p>I have heard about women losing the ability to wear contacts during pregnancy. And some other weird things too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2003, 19:26</p><p>Well Lore, since it was suggested by Susan back in 2000 that she had huge increases in myopia during pregnancy, I felt compelled to do some research.  I definately found a number of cases where already myopic ladies had to get much stronger prescriptions during pregnancies.  So, I felt that this was something I could use in some of my stories.  I am afraid that I can't accept your statement as fact in this case.  The only rule in myopia progression is that there are no rules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2003, 20:22</p><p>Susan's story was not true.  Women do not have huge increases in myopia while pregnant; it is something that does not happen.  It *is* true that acuity decreases while you are pregnant and/or nursing, but that is due to hormonal changes and acuity returns, in all cases, when the pregnancy and/or nursing stops.  The only exception I can imagine to that is if someone's eyesight was still changing anyway, in which case acuity would not return, as it would not have if the person weren't pregnant, but the change would not be any more rapid. </p><p> </p><p>I'm pregnant, so I've been doing a lot of reading on pregnancy, and this is an issue that actually comes up a lot.  Slight decreases in acuity are totally normal, as are problems wearing contacts, but there is simply no way that pregnancy can result in a permanent increase in myopia. </p><p> </p><p>A nice detail in the story, but the work of fiction (no doubt by a male author).  Just as there are no doubt tons of English headmasters of old who wore thick glasses, some of whom no doubt abused children.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2003, 19:37</p><p>Susan's story was proported to be more truth than fiction, with only the identifying details changed.  At the time I must say that I believed the story, although the high increases in myopia with the birth of each child did sound a bit of a stretch.  I was one who corresponded with Susan, and even in off the web e mails her story rang true, so I think that the discovery of the pedophile headmaster might just confirm it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2003, 19:22</p><p>Wow. I remember that story well. I remember thinking at the time that it had an awful lot of detail and length to be fiction, so it would have had to be either written by a fake with a super imagination, or, someone who was real ....... </p><p> </p><p>I forget if there was any follow-up on it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2003, 15:29</p><p>I also remember this story and I thought it did have a ring to it that seemed to be somthing more than fiction.  I actually don't remember it being posted under the fiction stories.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>chrisb</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2003, 15:11</p><p>Stranger than Fiction? </p><p> </p><p>Some old timers around here may remember, about 2 years ago, a lady posted under the name of Susan (I think) a story which she said was part fact and part fiction. It related her married life as someone with progressive myopia but with a husband who was pathologically unable to accept that she wore glasses. He would only allow her to wear contacts, and was violent towards her. One of her children was also mypic.  Eventually she had left her husband and gone to live with her GWG girlfriend; her sight had deteriorated further and she needed myodisks.   The denouement of the story was that 'Charles' her husband had been abused at Prep school (9 - 13 year olds) by the headmaster, who wore thick glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>In todays Daily Telegraph there is a half page story about a retired headmaster of a prep school who is accused of abuse by a number of former pupils. There, staring out of the paper is a picture of the man with thick heavy framed glasses. Could it be Susan's fiction was more fact than she was able to say. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2003, 04:03</p><p>Francine, you shouldn't be too discouraged if the response from this site to your Vision Training thread is not overwhelming. Although I don't know, I suspect that most readers of this site, if not fully-fledged OOs, are at least pleased and enthusiastic about glasses. Therefore most of them are probably at least content with their level of vision, and on balance probably more of them would prefer to increase their reliance on glasses rather than reduce it. </p><p>Having said that, I, for one, would deplore it if you felt you were being chased away. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion if expressed fairly. There is no excuse for rudeness, and I, too have noticed a degree of intolerance in some of the postings, eg on the subject of 'fakes' which seems to trigger a sort of paranoia in some people. I think it is best to ignore the rudeness; being seen to be irked by it only encourages them. </p><p>In a site of the diversity of this one (thank to Wurm, to whom we all owe a debt of gratitude) there will always be threads which we disagree with or are not interested in.

<p><b>Francine</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2003, 21:16</p><p>Hi Specs, </p><p> </p><p>Of course I agree with you. I know that Vision Training is a bit of a departure for this board, but I hope that the thread is going to continue and that Wurm will find a way to put it back on track. </p><p> </p><p>I am pretty busy these days but I like to post about VT, as I feel that it should at least be offered as an OPTION to people. Most people don't even know about it. There is a weird turf war between ophthalmologists and optometrists, and this keeps the info from being freeing disseminated. Some people HAVE to wear glasses, as their best corrected VA isn't even anything close to 20/20. Glasses are a valuable aid to millions of people. A lot of folks in third-world countries don't have access to glasses, and I've heard of specific charities that give out free glasses all over the world to impoverished people. </p><p> </p><p>It's a funny thing, too: The origin of most refractive disorders is actually a mystery. There are all sorts of theories about the etiology of myopia, for example, but they really are just educated guesses. The eyeball is not even enlongated in all cases. </p><p> </p><p>Vision, like the other senses, is to me sort of a miracle.

As much as I am a fan of people who wear glasses, I also realize that many of these same people don't want to wear glasses, and if vision training can help, as it has been proven to do in many cases, I say that people should go for it.  It seems to me far more sensible to attempt to correct your vision than to undergo lasik to correct a problem with surgery.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Francine</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2003, 20:53</p><p>Hi guys, </p><p> </p><p>I originally found this site because someone on another board told me it was really interesting. I think he found the desire of some people to INDUCE myopia fascinating and bizarre. </p><p> </p><p>I came to look and found myself posting about Vision Training, a time-tested form of vision improvement. "Wurm" (the moderator, I guess) was kind enough to put up a separate Vision Training thread for people who are interested in the subject.  </p><p> </p><p>I realize that "Eyescene" is mostly a board about wearing glasses and loving it. There will probably always be eyeglasses, and people who enjoy wearing them, unless someone invents a a chip or some nanotechnology that makes this all obsolete. Vision Training is pretty challenging, and I've never thought it was for everyone. Far from it. </p><p> </p><p>Why am I posting here? I just found out that there was a feedback thread, and I would like some feedback from you all. "Vision Training" was started last May, and it is not the most active of threads but I thought the questions asked have been relevant, and the information presented to be accurate and useful. In other words, it has been a valuable resource for people who have less than perfect eyesight, just like the rest of this board. </p><p> </p><p>Recently a couple of members have been, IMO, totally disrespecting the purpose of the Vision Training thread. They have been posting the usual stuff there, like Rx and how much they like wearing glasses, etc. This is fine on other threads, but totally OT on "Vision Training." I asked them to take their OT postings to the other threads, and the response was total rudeness. This kind of response really irks me...I wonder why. &lt;sigh&gt; </p><p> </p><p>This is why: I know from personal experience that if a bulletin board thread is allowed to go totally OT, it becomes totally useless. How do you guys feel about this? Do you feel that having a thread about Vision Training is useful? Should it be allowed to be thrown totally OT, or does it deserve some measure of respect and integrity?  </p><p> </p><p>How would it be if the fiction section was full of general postings about Rx ? Or if the thread about good_looking girls with glasses had pleas for info about glasses for 3-year-old hyperopes? The board would be a mess: Total chaos. Why would anyone like that to happen...? I'm sure that "Wurm" would like your opinions on this as well.  </p><p> </p><p>Of course I am not exactly unbiased, as Vision Training is a pet subject of mine. So I feel like this is something being done to ME. But generally speaking, taking a thread way OT, and insisting on keeping it there...WELL, I think it's just  destructiveness. Vandalism, pure and simple. </p><p> </p><p>Cheers, </p><p>Francine</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2003, 17:17</p><p>Julian, The more I think about it the more I see that you may be right about this.  I did say to the administrator of optical4less that I would be recommending his service to an online discussion group about vision etc. </p><p>My thinking at the time was that I didn't want him to think it odd if a sudden influx of high Rx orders came in.  I didn't mention Eyescene but it doesn't take long to get here via Google as we know.  If I have inadvertantly caused a problem I do apologise.  Having said that, the fact remains that my whole experience purchasing glasses from this outlet was genuinely positive and I did want to share that with everyone here. </p><p>Cheers......... tortoise</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2003, 12:00</p><p>Lens chat works in frames. (Ha Ha, but true) The upper frame contains the chat data, and the lower one contains the post code.

There was Stefan, who called himself nicebloke at first; and Yuen-Ming, and you. I remember your account of trying on your brother's glasses; it gave me quite a thrill ::) - it was a few months later that I read it when I discovered the site, which changed my whole attitude to the internet. Also, I think, you were the first guy on here to mention, very discreetly, that you liked other guys in glasses. I don't think you have to worry too much about posting what you've posted before; it's only small minority who look at anything other than what's easily visible, nowadays the last 25 posts in each topic. But then I would say that, wouldn't I? ::) </p><p>Good grief, what a ramble! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Daffy</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2003, 16:27</p><p>Sorry Mark, I wasn't having a go at you. I missunderstood. I know there are fakers, I don't want to say how I pick them as they may then change their writing style. Usually the fakers will get bored and have nothing else to say and usually go away (and make a new character). However, some seem 'fake' but I guess that the benifit of doubt must be given as I was proven wrong in the past. I don't want to give any more time on this topic. That's it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2003, 01:57</p><p>Ideally, everything posted on this site would be true, unless it was clearly fiction.  I can understand, too, how upset someone might be if they had invested a lot of effort and, maybe, emotion in a long correspondence only to find that the other correspondent was a fake. But, other than these rare(?) cases, who is actually harmed if their are some contributions which are not totally honest. We would wish it were not so, but sometimes I am a little alarmed (if that is not too strong a word) at the angry and intolerant reactions of a few contributors to suspected fakes. This has undoubtedly frightened some people off contributing and is our loss. </p><p> </p><p>Lets be tolerant and polite, even if you might be suspicious. This is not a criticism of any posters in the last few days, but i think most of us know the sort of thing I mean. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2003, 23:14</p><p>Daffy, don't misunderstand me. I'm not labeling anyone or any situation as an obvious fake. Rather, I was attempting (obviously unsuccessfully) to make light of the stories that get posted over and over where the writers have amazingly similar experiences, in the same basic sequence, on impossibly accelerated timelines. And I know firsthand what can happen when you try someone's glasses. I put on my brother's new glasses when I was 12 and was floored to see individual blades of grasses out the window. Of course, my reaction was to refuse to talk about it and ignore the reality of myopia for years. But here I go, typing the same things I've typed before so I'll stop now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2003, 12:59</p><p>I read Eye Scene daily. When I do not have the internet access (like when I am at my MotherÃÂs) I really have a cold turkey. </p><p>And the screen names seen as friends? YES! I do feel we are real friends.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daffy</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2003, 22:38</p><p>Mark, I think some of those 'obvious fake lines' are a little unrealistic. I for one first got glasses when it was about -3. Also, I do know people that got glasses just because they put on their friends (low power) and saw better. The other lines are obvious though.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2003, 21:08</p><p>I've been kicking around here since something like the third or fourth question of the original format. Difficult to believe it's been six years or so. Seems more like six months. Never thought I'd come to view screen names as friends. Julian, Filthy, tinyeyes and Chris (have never warmed to the Wurm label because he's so not one) among many others all qualify though. For me, I became more of a lurker when I found myself typing the same things over and over and over. I am most definitely still here though. Reading most active threads several times a week if not daily. As to the question of the moment, I could care less about whether a particular person's stories are fact or fiction. Rather I'm appalled and ultimately bored by the unoriginality of the obvious fakes. "I can't read the board at school. I tried on my friend's glasses and I could see. Does this mean I need glasses. Should I go for an eye test? How thick will the lenses be? Oh I went and I got a prescription of -3.5. Three months latter, I went for another test and now I'm -6. And in two weeks I'll get bifocals. Then prisms. Do you think I should do this?" What's my point? I have no idea anymore. But it sure was fun getting here.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daffy</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2003, 16:36</p><p>I started on the old eye scene. I don't post much, just now and then when topics of interest comes up and I have something to say. I remember being a novice at internet stuff. I can't remember how I found ES. I remember posting and downloading the archives to catch up on everything from the start. It took me weeks (if not months) to catch up. When I finally did, I tried to post and it wouldn't until I realised that it moved to this new format. </p><p> </p><p>I learnt how to pick up on fakes (mainly there language and phrases they use). None really ticked me off though. I just didn't respond. </p><p> </p><p>I was so happy to realise that I wasn't the only person on this earth that had a thing for GWG. This site made me realise that there are more like me, even though I still prefer to be relativly annonymous. I just hope that other new-comers can discover this site and find out that they too are not alone.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2003, 05:55</p><p>Thanks Filthy, Eddy, Bobby for your very helpful perspectives.  You have stimulated my interest and I've begun reading the archives from the start.  </p><p>Filthy, when you talk about your "journey of self discovery" you express very well what I am doing here and I'm sure it's true for others as well.  Thinking about all the people who have interacted in some way with Eyescene over the years, I think a huge amount of good has resulted.  Some will have made progress in understanding and accepting themselves while others just feel a little less isolated. </p><p>Sincerest thanks to Wurm for creating this remarkable venue.  Eyescene is the most active and easiest to use forum I have found but, more than that, it is a real community, diverse, tolerant, and inclusive.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;19 Jul 2003, 14:00</p><p>Tortoise, </p><p>my discovery of the ES was not spoiled by those fakes. At the beginning I was not able to recognize them, later I did not mind them too much. Only one really pissed me off: Erzsi. I wanted to visit her and almost set off for a trip to "her town".  </p><p>The fakes of today are not so interested as those old ones used to be. I cannot tell for 100% who is fake, but still I have some candidates. They will disappear soon, once their creators run out of imagination or pressure that helped tem to create their "second self". </p><p>Tom the Hungarian created many fakes and has many imitators. I must say that not only were TomÃÂs fake girls really hot, but also too hot to be real. I liked his stories. </p><p>I have met some members / lurkers personally, interesting experience, I like meeting friends from here.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eddy</b>&nbsp;19 Jul 2003, 01:02</p><p>At the risk of sounding a bit Rush Limbaugh, let me add my "ditto" to Filthy's comments about Chris. Thanks Chris. Of course the composition of our posting changes from time to time and some groups are more interesting than others. Six years is a long time; a twenty year today old was pubescent when this all started. And an intelligent reading of the archives reveals that some of our most respected posters have over time had enough personae to start their own schizophrenia society. But as Richie Cunningham would say, What the hey. I suppose I find some of the weirder manifestations of our shared interest as puzzling as anybody. The braces, amputations and suchlike don't do it for me. Come to think of it, at my age nothing much does it for me. But what has been truly remarkable has been the tolerance and forbearance with which everyone has treated this diversity. Even in the case of some MAJOR arseholes who have almost always been shown the door with far more diplomacy than your correspondent was ever capable of, even when he did diplomacy for his daily bread. Great work Chris. Needless to say I miss some of our old correspondents like Tom the Hungarian, some of the manifestations of current contributors and people like Meganekko. And it was great to see Yuen-Ming back again. The flourish of having lasiked down to -7 was true Yuen-Ming. What style!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;19 Jul 2003, 00:31</p><p>I cannot speak for Julian.  Well, I could, but he'd probably be pissed off if I did, despite the fact that he awarded me the title of honorary queen a few years ago. </p><p> </p><p>For myself, I have stopped caring all that much about who's a fake and who's not.  A few are obvious, a few are suspect, and a few appear genuine.  As for responding to a fake, well, the prospect of chatting online with a "real" glasses girl when there are so many around me is just not interesting anymore.  If Gayle or Sarah were to return, I'd be overjoyed; both were friends in correspondence outside ES.  Otherwise, I am older, wiser, and more aloof. </p><p> </p><p>Initially, this was, for me, a forum I used to work through my fascination with GWGs.  I had always known about it, but bringing it out and articulating it took me on a journey of self-discovery that was extremely useful.  I'll always be grateful to Wurm for putting it up and maintaining it for all these years. </p><p> </p><p>Tom was a bit too much for me, although I know many treat this as a forum for fantasy.  He manipulated people deliberately, obviously and unapologetically.   </p><p> </p><p>Although most people who post here are pleasant or at least harmless, there have ben a few that genuinely seemed creepy.  One guy snuck atropine into his girlfriend's eyes, for Dog's sake.  I start to have second thoughts about a person when they let on that they think about other human beings as mere avenues to gratification.  We all ogle.  Some do things that are more sinister. </p><p> </p><p>As for the "real" GWGs who went away, well, I guess there's only so long that people are interested in talking about their vision and their glasses.  Initially, they probably liked the novelty of all the attention, but       the glow wore off and they moved on. </p><p> </p><p>Sarah was remarkable - articulate and sweet. If she was a fake then she was the best fake ever - I got a Christnas card and a voice recording from her, and later managed to get a picture.    She was a congenital myope of about -23D, half Asian and unabashed about shopping for, trying on and wearing different frames.  One of her early posts used to be in the 'writings' section; it summarizes her writing style very well.   </p><p> </p><p>I have not heard from her in over three years, though.  I also hope she is well. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jules?  Anything to add? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yuen-Ming</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2003, 20:42</p><p>I am an "old timer" -- I lurk but I don't participate much any more. I had laser surgery to correct high myopia but I still wear contacts or glasses as the laser surgery only took me to -7.00 or so. </p><p>I have married since my Eye Scene days, and I have a little boy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2003, 20:32</p><p>Julian, Filthy, and other "oldtimers"; </p><p>It is always interesting to hear the reminiscences of those of you who were around at he beginning (or thereabouts) of this forum.  Do you think that the discovery that many of the most intriguing posters were fakes was a sort of trauma that has, to some extent, spoiled the experience for you since then?  I know the thought of responding to fakes or of being taken for a fake made posting quite difficult for me at first. </p><p> </p><p>Would you say that there are fewer fakes here today or are there just as many but for some reason they are not as colourful and enthralling as they were in the good old days?  Maybe the biggest difference is that "Tom the Hungarian" eventually went away. </p><p> </p><p>What about the ones who were real?  Did they just disappear without a trace?  I'd like to hear a little more about "Sarah" of the early days.  I wonder how she is doing now. </p><p>Anything more you would like to say about these early times would be welcome.

Funny how people were more interested when I posted on the other threads. It doesn't matter. All I wanted was to be able to give out the information, as the OMDs and POs act like VT doesn't even exist!!! </p><p> </p><p>BTW, sometimes I have to tell people, especially parents of little kids, that they SHOULD wear their glasses if the VTOD wants them to. Sometimes this is necessary so that overconvergence problems, etc. can even begin to be worked on.  </p><p> </p><p>Then there was the case on AAPOS where a mother said her little kid didn't want to wear her glasses. I told her they should be FASHIONABLE, really "cool," like glasses the moviestars wore, and then the little girl would be happy to wear them. I was all set to send people over here,as you folks on ES are really knowledgeable about fashion and eyeglasses. But they got SO angry at me for talking about fashion, I didn't DARE, LOL. </p><p> </p><p>Funny how some people think. Fashion is a multi-billion-dollar business, that alot of people DO take very seriously, heh... </p><p> </p><p>Cheers, </p><p>Fran</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;03 May 2003, 09:34</p><p>The site migration (mentioned below) is beginning. It's a fairly elaborate process, which may not be complete for a few days. </p><p> </p><p>I'm leaving posting capability on, for now, but posts made in the next day or two will be going to the "old" site, not the "new" site. </p><p> </p><p>I will probably be able to restore posts made over the weekend, but I can't guarantee it -- it will be a low priority. At some point there will be a 'rollback' of at least several hours while files are copied over to the new server. </p><p> </p><p>Also, this address location (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180815103109/http://eyescene.net)/" target="_blank">http://eyescene.net)</a> may "die" for a few hours as the new servers address propagates across the internet address servers. Then it should reappear as before, although the directory location of some of the BBS scripts will change. </p><p> </p><p>I will try to post some updates to the ES front page. </p><p> </p><p>During this time, your mileage may vary.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2003, 06:43</p><p>I will be transferring the scripts that run ES to a new upgraded server in the next couple of weeks. The site will remain hosted by Laughing Squid, and the front page will still be found at the same place. Some bookmarks might change, such as the main thread index for the BBS. </p><p> </p><p>One side benefit will be an increase in bandwidth for the site. </p><p> </p><p>There will probably be an hour or two of downtime at some point. </p><p> </p><p>I expect the project will be fairly routine. As I get further into it, I will post announcements here. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2003, 11:47</p><p>Daffy - I might check the postings a few times a day when I'm at home - especially if a 'hot' topic is being added to all the time. I don't have a particular favourite thread - as I find good comments can pop up almost anywhere. Like you and Puffin - the XXX Links have the least appeal. I'd sooner read something interesting than squint at a low-res nude to figure out if she's wearing glasses or just got bags under her eyes!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2003, 15:38</p><p>Daffy, I'm with you on your opinion of the XXX stuff. Most of it is simply nudes in amazingly boring and feeble lenses, you might as well have ordinary XXX stuff and have done with it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>myofan</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2003, 08:35</p><p>I generally use the "most recent" page to track threads of interest to me.

<p><b>Daffy</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2003, 16:41</p><p>Just wondering...those of us that are regulars...when going thru the treads, do you read 'all' the treads from when you last read them?

<p><b>Robert2</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2003, 11:48</p><p>Wurm, </p><p>For the past 6 years, you have done a great job of keeping the trolls and bickering on your boards under control.  That is not an easy task (a few unpleasant members of sci.med.vision drove all of the OO's from that NG about the same time ES was launched, and Yahoo message boards are useless for potitical discussions, as they are now some kind of perpetual cyberKlan meeting, regardless of topic).  I prefer not to register with sites, but if I had to, I would register with this one.  It has been one of my favorite off-the-wall sites since I hooked my old 133 Pentium up to the Internet in mid-97. Until that point, I thought that my fascination with GWG's was a weird quirk that I would have to keep to myself.  Keep up the retro-1995 site design (those of us with dial up connections appreciate that).  Happy 6th anniversary.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2003, 18:04</p><p>Thanks LG -- very festive!! 8-) </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2003, 09:23</p><p>Has the sixth birthday happened? 'Glasseschat 1: Are glasses sexy?' began on 30 March 1997. Was there something going on even before that? I found ES in August of that year, and have enjoyed it ever since (I wasn't always Julian) and made a lot of online friends.

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2003, 20:10</p><p>Well, I hope that this wasn't what bothered him so much. I did appreciate him keeping his site porn free, but if I were to venture a guess, I would guess that he has met someone who is very important to him, and he didn't want to reveal his secrets.  It does hurt me though to think that those lovely blue plastic framed myodiscs ended up in the trash bin. </p><p>Oh, and if my guess is correct I wish Alain much happiness, and I hope that his lady love is a suitably myopic lady.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>one who knows.</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2003, 09:00</p><p>I think i know what's going on with Alain. You know he's always kept a porn free site. About a month ago, he discovered that there was a link to his site from a porn site and that really upset him. It could be more than that too, but i believe that this is not something he took lightly.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GwGs</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2003, 01:54</p><p>Hi High Myope, </p><p> </p><p>I emailed Alain when he said he wanted to sell his glasses and asked how much he would sell the whole collection for - i was imaging it wouldn't be a vast sum of money but he came back to me and see he was selling the frames with the thickest lenses for 150 Euros each and the glasses with regular lenses (about up to -6) for 100 Euros each, i'm not very good with conversion rates but i think that would mean that he wanted between ÃÂ£75-100+ for each pair of glasses!!! </p><p> </p><p>I told him that i could no way afford that and was expecting them to be priced more like Stingray's glasses on eBay. </p><p> </p><p>I received no response. </p><p> </p><p>I emailed him again and said i hoped we could work something out as i would love to add a couple of his frames to my collection but i again didn't receive any response. </p><p> </p><p>What is going on??!!</p><p></p><hr>
