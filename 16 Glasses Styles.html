<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2013, 15:35</p><p>In commenting to "til" over in the "actresses" thread he posted a picture of a Rosie Huntington Whiteley wearing a pair of what appeared to be vintage glasses from the late 50's. Anyway I commented that I well remember that style of glasses and I even kept several pairs when I came across them in the donation boxes. They are so nice and I think they would be a big hit today.  </p><p>It got me thinking about one pair of glasses that I just couldn't part with and still have them. They are a pair of glasses made by a company called Artcraft and I  was surprised to find they are still in business today. The glasses came in a hard shell metal case with a small cleaning cloth and a business card inside. The business card had the date the glasses were sold and the name of the patient they were for. The date was 1941. Very small and light weight. They were 16 crt gold filled, they were semi rimless and the lenses were held in by just one screw around the bridge area. the lens were made of glass not plastic and the nose pads were made from ivory. The etching that was on the very narrow temples was hand etched and they were cable temples. Cable temples are the springy type that wrap around behind the ear. The real odd thing was that when I checked them out they were only +.25 in both eyes. In 1941 a war was going on and money was very short in most cases and I am surprised that anyone would feel the need to spend money on glasses that did so little. </p><p>I checked into Artcraft and they actually still have that very same style of glasses as the one I have, but I am sure it is not made with a gold filled frame or ivory nose pads and no hand etching etc. But that said they still look quite good and I am a bit surprised that I don't see them in any optical store as i would think they would sell. My only guess is that most optical stores don't like dealing with drill mount styles and that is what these are.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>independent optician</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2013, 01:55</p><p>A video response to the 60 Minutes segment on Luxottica. 60 Minutes forgot about the independent sector of the eyewear industry but here is what they have to say: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132717/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOteUP9R23E" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOteUP9R23E</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Oct 2012, 02:11</p><p>Thanks Wurm I saw that it was on the TV while at a sports bar but the sound was turned down as everyone else was watching a football game. I was sorry I had missed it. So I am glad you linked it. </p><p>I already knew about what was beings aid and I totally agree that it is no more than a monoply. I didn't know that they also had gotten into the insurance business as well.  </p><p>I have a very good friend that is an optician at the local Pearle store and they always runt the same sale, but change the signs colors every couple months to make the sale appear new. But even worse is that not long ago they did make a revision on the sign in very small print. The sale used to be simply buy one and get a 2nd pair free. Now at first glance it still says the same thing but in very small letters it says right below get a 2nd pair free (up to $250.00) Well the problem with that is that it is nearly impossible to purchase any glasses with lenses for much less than $400.00. So by taking advantage of the so called 2 nd free pair it will still add an additional $150.00 or more to your total bill. I told her that it is a bout as close to misleading as you can get and maybe even fraud. She just smiled and said "well they don't have to take the 2nd pair" So my point is not much of a deal. By the way this young lady of course takes advantage of getting her yearly free pair of glasses, but she also has purchased 5 pairs of glasses on-line as well and makes it clear if and when she quits she will never be a customer of Pearle and her glasses will be come from on-line.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2012, 22:50</p><p>60 Minutes ran a segment on Luxottica yesterday. It's an interesting look behind the scenes, hosted by Lesley Stahl. </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132717/http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7424700n&amp;tag=api" target="_blank">http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7424700n&amp;tag;=api</a> </p><p> </p><p>I wasn't really sure where to put this. It deals with fashion, the business and affordability (among other topics). So I thought I'd 'necro' an old thread. </p><p> </p><p>I'm not sure how viewable this will be outside the USA.</p><p></p><hr>







<p><b>Jim</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2010, 05:22</p><p>Emma. I have seen a girl in her 20s wearing some lovely glasses this morning. They had plastic frames with black rectangular fronts and silvery white wide sides. Her lenses weren't too thick, but she had one or two lovely power rings around both edges. An altogether perfect combination, and she looked very content wearing them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2010, 15:40</p><p>Talking about pince nez - I use pince nez in my photo shoots whenever a model has the appropriate Rx. None of my models ever saw a real pince nez and it's always a hilarious moment when they try to put them on. But they all liked the experiment and some of the portraits are really nice. I  posted a couple of photos of two models (in their fifties) in pince nez. The ladies enjoyed that minute and it was a very special, rewarding moment for the three of us. </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132717/http://ladiesbehindcrystalveil.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://ladiesbehindcrystalveil.blogspot.com/</a> </p><p>(Mieke and Margriet)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2010, 12:54</p><p>The only times I've ever seen pince-nez have been on Hogan's Heroes and the Three Stooges.  And considering the literal translation into English, and my love for big, bold, and beautiful plastic frames, I certainly will never use pince-nez.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2010, 08:56</p><p>Jennifer and Emma - About 7 years ago I came across a pair of the pinchers in our collection box of donated glasses. They were really pretty cool, they had spring loaded nose pads that you had to pich above the nose to make them stay on. I would think if you were to wear them for very long you would have deep marks on your nose where the pads hit. I made the mistake of letting a girl borrow them to show to her friends, when she returned them one lens was broke as they were made of glass. I wish I still had them. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2010, 08:39</p><p>Nice find, Emma.  It's always good to see historical items make a comeback.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2007, 00:56</p><p>Okay about sunglasses (maybe a sunglasses topic is required). Has anyone else spent a lot of money (well lots of small sums anyway) on sunglasses that looked fine in the little mirror on the stand with the tag hanging off, badly pushed out of the way, then when you got home they looked entirely different and usually ugly? </p><p> </p><p>I have. I've only ever had I think two pairs I've ever liked and I've lost one and broke the second.

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;21 May 2007, 07:59</p><p>I too LOVE drop temples, the larger the frames, imo, the better.

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2007, 04:20</p><p>Drop-temple lover, </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, the pictures of our favorite style that were on the web of glasses that I have are no longer there.  I'm disappointed, to say the least.  I do not own a digital camera, so I don't know of any way to upload any photos of my frames.  The last drop-temple frame I bought was over 8 years ago, as no place carries them anymore.  :( </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Drop temple lover</b>&nbsp;22 Mar 2007, 01:44</p><p>Christine - where can you still buy drop-temples? I'd love a pair! </p><p> </p><p>Melyssa - would love to see some pictures of your frames. Can you put them on the web somewhere? </p><p> </p><p>Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2007, 19:01</p><p>Sorry, I meant Christine.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2007, 19:00</p><p>Christina -- I have a medium sized face and medium sized frames and their size is 48-17-135, for whatever that's worth.  They're proportioned just right for me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daffy</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2007, 17:20</p><p>the first number descibes the maximum lens diamemter. </p><p> </p><p>the second number describes the bridge width (the part that sits on your nose) </p><p> </p><p>the third number describes the length of the side arms. </p><p> </p><p>All measured in millimeters. It all depends on your head size for a good fit.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2007, 10:15</p><p>Christine, </p><p> </p><p>As the "Diva of Drop-Temples," I would venture myself to be an expert on those frames.  But for any frame, the 54-15-140 frames are longer (140-130) on the sides and wider (15-11) than the 54-11-130's.  Personally, I prefer the larger frames for a better fit and for a better range of vision. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christine</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2007, 09:19</p><p>The other frames I am looking at are listed as </p><p>54 15 140 </p><p>Would these be much larger than the first ones? </p><p> </p><p>Again... thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christine</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2007, 09:17</p><p>I am looking to get some new frames online and I have a question about the size.  It is listed as </p><p>54 11 130 </p><p>These are retro low temple glasses.  I expect them to be pretty big, but am wondering just how large they will be.  I am not familiar with the numbers and waht they represnet.  Any help will be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daffy</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2007, 05:48</p><p>Here are some interesting stats that was sent ot me via email from a vision/eyecare professional bi-monthly e-newsletter. It's really interesting... </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Eyeglass Resurgence Leads to U.S. Optical Industry Growth </p><p> </p><p>After a precipitous decline in usage during the calendar year 2005, there was a revival of eyeglass usage in 2006 with more and more Americans utilizing eyeglasses as a means of vision correction. In December 2006, about 65.1 percent of the American adult population was regularly wearing Rx eyeglasses, representing a total of 146.6 million adults. The percentage of the population wearing Rx eyeglasses has crept up recently and the total number of adult eyeglass wears has increased by 3.4 million during the year 2006. This recent increase in eyeglass usage can be attributed to American men and Americans between the ages of 18 to 44, two groups that have historically used eyeglasses less frequently than other demographics. </p><p> </p><p>This increase in eyeglass usage has led to an increase in eyeglass sales in the U.S. during the 12 month ending period December 2006. During this period of time there were 69 million pairs of frames sold in the US (+4.9% over the previous year) valued at slightly more than $ 8 billion (+4.3% over the pervious year). Simultaneously, there were 76.3 million pairs of Rx lenses sold during the 12 month ending period December 2006 (+3.4% over the previous year) valued at $7.7 billion (+1.1% over the previous year). The strongest growth markets during 2006 were high-end frames priced at more than $150 per pair, single vision lenses, photochromic lenses and A-R coated lenses.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>groovylicious</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2007, 15:56</p><p>Yeap, I wear glasses. I've been togged up in them ever since primary four and my earliest frame were made from some hideous plastic thingy and it was huge. Made me looked like a dork but yeah, I was a dork. I was a nerd back then and every body hates me and now they couldn't believe what I have turned into. They even still gossip about me.. How could a nerdy misshapen into such a harebrained character. Whatever.. Like I care.. </p><p> </p><p>I hate wearing them coz it kinda restrict me from moving freely. The frame keep sliding down my nose [sebab tak cukup mancung, obviously] so my credit go to who-ever-invented-contact-lenses for the reason of his or her genius invention, I can now act as if I have perfect vision like everybody else. But my eyes, they are quite sensitive so I have to use my glasses more than lenses. </p><p> </p><p>I always heard that guys are less-attracted to girls who wear glasses. In fact in any movies, to illustrate the role of an unattractive girl, she will always be wearing glasses. What's wrong with people who wear glasses? It's like a statement everywhere and when I'm with it I'll feel..self concious..Like muke aku mcm tak siap..Padahal dah siap-siap dah tadik..weird..Lasik?No thanks, I don't like the idea something poking my eyes. I dunno but to me I do find certain girls with glasses are attractive, if the frame is right. For guys..I find no problem with guys who wear glasses. I think it's cute. You know back in uni, I'm quite attracted to guys who were nerdy and wear glasses. I'll like ..try to find any excuse to talk to them even it's obviously lame, like asking for a piece of paper coz I like to see them menggelupur even the fact that I rarely talk to people. Kiut dowh. Terkemut-kemut koyakkan kertas. And the next time I see them, I'll flash them a smile and they'll smile back sheepishly. Totally cute. But according to my friends, that kind of behaviour was mean.. And I just don't understand why. </p><p> </p><p>Actually I have a smaller frame before, a DKNY frame. I love that frame because at times I felt like me and esther canadias are alike [hahaha, I know..you don't have to say it]. But after an aghast occurrence somewhere between end of August and beginning of September, I decided to revamp my look so I purchased this frame without thinking twice. My heart was breaking like you-don't-know-how-bad-it-was and I need to buy something to cheer me up. A new pair glasses seemed appropriate. So, no more making weird faces on seeing me with my glasses on ok? And don't ask me why I wear them coz the answer is simple.. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2007, 08:18</p><p>Continued from last post: </p><p>2. Laura Biagotti frames.  Thick ovesize plastic frames, multi-colored fronts with black temples.  These frames were sheer beauties.  Came out about 1987. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Present day small rectangular plastic frames with wide temples.  These look good regardless of the prescription.   </p><p> </p><p>What do you like?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2007, 08:16</p><p>Thinking about all the eyeglass frames I have encountered over the years, here are my favorite 3 types of frames in this order: </p><p>1) A tie between the first rimless glasses held together with screws and facet lenses.  I was mesmorized in the early 1980's at the sight of rimless glasses, especially when the outer edges were highly polished.  Same for the facet glasses which shined like jewels.  I especially liked clear lenses, with many highly polished edges. </p><p>Will continue in next post.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Visitboy</b>&nbsp;12 Aug 2006, 04:45</p><p>Thanks Filthy. I haven't come across pantoscopic tilt before. However, I can see that this would be useful for a snooker player, for example, but why for a guy wearing single vision lenses like these? </p><p> </p><p>It wasn't the effect of the way the lenses fitted. It was a distinctly angled frame. The reason I put this in under Glasses Styles is that I've noticed that a lot of my grandparents' generation wore such angled frames. Great for seeing downwards, or just changing fashions?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2006, 16:17</p><p>Alternatively, where thick lenses are fitted such that the optical center is significantly either above or below the vertical center of the frame, the difference in thickness between the top and bottom edges of the lens can make it look like the lens is tilted, when in fact the plus curve (or plano surface, in the case of something around -8) should be about parallel to the frame.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2006, 15:53</p><p>It sounds like you are describing pantoscopic tilt.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Visitboy</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2006, 15:28</p><p>Has anyone noticed changing fashions in the angle of the lenses in glasses. I saw a guy in London the other day who wouldn't usually have grabbed my attention, but for (inevitably) a pair of nice thick minus lenses. They were in a light gold frame, rounded rectangular design, with great lenses sticking out well around the frame. I'd guess around -8.00 at least. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, the lenses were angled out about 30 degrees from the vertical. Frames just bent (Didn't look this way.) or is there adesign benefit to the wearer of lenses at this angle? </p><p> </p><p>Well he was cute with those frames, anyway!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wei</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2005, 14:30</p><p>Yes I agreeing large frame give more good view area and also is looking very nice on girl in dropped temple style i think.  Is great shame not in fashionable time now.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2005, 04:13</p><p>Absolutely, Frances.  My Mom (may she rest in peace) wore metal frames the last 30 years of her life, and they were large so they could accommodate her executive bifocals.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Frances</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2005, 14:08</p><p>good for you Mel, they still look great, for good vision you cannot beat a large lens, and for bifocal wearers, they must be really great, large reading area and large distance area. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2005, 12:50</p><p>To respond to Puffin and Lazysiow from the "Seen on the Web" thread, as one of the few women in this vast wasteland of a universe who still wears large and midsized drop-temples, I believe the frames (pardon the pun) "dropped out of sight" because they became very popular among senior women in the mid-1980s, causing my contemporaries to stop wearing them because they "looked too old" as some said. </p><p> </p><p>It's true that how a frame looks depends upon the wearer.  I still get lots of compliments about mine, and they are my favorite style. </p><p> </p><p>As for those new little drop-temples, I actually saw one our local NFL players wearing them as sunglasses.  He's over 6 feet tall and 300 pounds, so I guess no one will make fun of him.  It was odd seeing it, though. </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

I've always thought it's somehow easier for men to look good with glasses, but there are a couple of attractive and stylish women at work who have done it; they make glasses part of their personal style, that's the key.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2004, 07:58</p><p>GWG's, My current prescription is OD -15.50 x +1.00 x 090 and OS -13.00 plano add +3.00. I've had this Rx for a couple monthes now, but these glasses fold down really well. It's just that i had the aforementioned problem with some of my weaker glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2004, 06:37</p><p>Paula, </p><p>The problem that i've had in the past is where the lenses are so thick that i cannot fold my glasses totally down. I hate that. I haven't got that problem with my current glasses, Thank goodness, because i do like to fold my glasses up when i take them off. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Drop Temps Rule</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2004, 04:14</p><p>Clare so what kind of glasses did you end up getting? Any pics?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dr.S.</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2004, 05:18</p><p>I have also had a problem where the nose pads were held too close together by the thick inside edges of lenses. This is very easy to fix - you can do it yourself or get an optician to do it. Just remove the lenses from the frames and grind away part of the inside back corner of the lenses (bevel them) in the nose pad area, to create some clearance. Plastic lenses are best beveled using a sander with fine sandpaper. Glass lenses should be done by an optician, because the grinding needs to be done wet, to avoid cracking.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>PAULA</b>&nbsp;02 Feb 2004, 21:07</p><p>Theother problem I have had is sometimes the lenses are thick enough so that you can only open the nose pads so far</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;02 Feb 2004, 14:43</p><p>Paula, I'm sure you would look great in rimless.  In my opinion, rimless sometimes look insipid and dull in very low prescriptions, especially with high-index lenses which can look very flimsy.  With stronger lenses the lens itself can be the feature and can give a real sparkle to your eyes. </p><p>I say go for it.   </p><p>Do let us know what you decide and how you get on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dr. S.</b>&nbsp;02 Feb 2004, 08:27</p><p>This responds to note by Paula in Sightings, regarding rimless glasses for -16.25 prescription. Semi-rimless frames with invisible nylon bands holding the lenses in place will accept lenses of any edge thickness, and thick lenses tend to look quite attractive in such frames. Pick a frame with hinges set well back so the temples will fold behind the lens edges. Screw mount rimless frames are more of a problem. The maximum edge thickness is limited by available screw length (10 mm is about the thickest lens you would want to try). High index is not necessarily a solution - the lenses are thinner but may be more brittle and hard to drill. Myodisc lenses are an excellent choice for very nearsighted folks who want rimless. Ask for lenses with a "positive carrier" (plus curvature on the part of the lens outside the viewing zone). That will help to keep the outer edges quite thin where the screws go through.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2004, 20:38</p><p>Clare, In my opinion most women are stunning,in rimless with no tint especially in your -2.50 lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2004, 18:43</p><p>Clare, </p><p> </p><p>I think the new "drop-temples" and the various high modernist and crafts looks are played out for now. Smaller laminated plastics are holding up pretty well, but aren't exactly a new thing. </p><p> </p><p>If you want to play it safe, rimless are supposed to be big this year. The new wrap-style lenses are a relatively fresh rimless look. </p><p> </p><p>If you'd like to be more ironic, daring or avant-garde, look for something large and dramatic. </p><p> </p><p>Of course, the real quest is for what looks great on you regardless of the dictates of fashion -- kind of a "know it when you see it" thing. There's nothing like finding a frame that's uniquely you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GwGs</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2003, 03:24</p><p>Hi Lorrena, thanks for posting a couple of great stories about drop temples; </p><p> </p><p>I am a great collector of drop temples and large / "oversized" womens glasses and would love to see a photo of your glasses or you wearing them. </p><p> </p><p>I had bought a lovely pair of Christian Dior gold rimmed Sophia Loren style glasses with thick lenses (the power must only be about -2.75 to -3 but the lenses were incredibly thick and must be about 2 or 3cm thick at the edge!! - i presumed these were old skool lenses) on eBay from America but i went i got them the lenses had fallen out and was embarassed to take them to an optician to get the lenses fitted back into the frame. Anyway, I plucked up the courage and walked into several shops, two of which asked if i had bought the frame in there which i said i didn't know as they weren't mine, they were my mums and she couldn't see very well without them hence me asking them to fix them. </p><p> </p><p>Well, these first two opticians said they didn't they could do anything as the frames were so large, and the lenses so thick (!!!) but they'd have a go - i came back in ten minutes and both stores said they couldn't fit them back and they didn't think anyone could. </p><p> </p><p>I was annoyed as these glasses were so beautiful but had only $7.00 US for them so it didn't matter that much i thought.  </p><p> </p><p>But then i remembered there was a Boots opticians and i thought a big chain of opticians instead of the previous two independents might have better tools or more experience at this type of thing so i gave them the glasses, and remarkably, at the same time there was a lady there with her drop temples and she also wanted her lenses putting back in. </p><p> </p><p>They did mine within about 5 minutes for free but i did get a dodgy look from one of the assistants when they gave me back the glasses - he said he'd never such big frames or thick lenses before!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RNR</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2003, 14:02</p><p>Lorrena, Im actually not that big fan of drop temples, but as always the right combination would make the day. But those "modern-style" ones look really cool. If you only go with them because you try to find the "perfect fiting" pair, think there would be alot more options available, like light weight rimless styles, or for example the whole Lindberg Titanium collection (air titanium). Also a rimless pair would offer the option for a larger than todays normal style lense shape, to offer the all around clear view as you said. </p><p>Think I can imagine the faces of optical business people if they come across a young woman wearing a frame that was hip 20 years back :-) but more important is to wear whatever you makes happy and not what others might think about it...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alana</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2003, 11:28</p><p>Can anyone recommend makeup for rimless glasses? I'd like to get some but I think they can be difficult, especially for those that have colour on the arms or bridge. I tried some nice ones with blue arms etc but my eyes looked like they disappeared a bit. I have blue eyes and blond hair so I thought the blue in the frames would complement. Is it better to play the makeup effect up or down do you think?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lorrena</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2003, 16:39</p><p>RNR, thanks for the link. Those drop temples look great! I'll have to explore those frames as they are a mix between the small squarish look and the drop temples. If they look good on me, I'd wear those. </p><p> </p><p>Currently, the ones is have to wear at home are large. They are dark blue (almost black). I like those a lot as my vision is clear all around. You should see the look on the eye docs when I take them in to get a new RX in them. I tell them that they are my moms and she is too sick to go out. </p><p> </p><p>I wear those only because they are so comfortable. Not because I particualarly like drop temple frames. When I first got them, I tried on a lot of different pairs. I went to the ridiculous frames just to try them on. When I put the drop temples on they felt so snug on my nose. They felt like they were made for me. I'll try to explain...the nose bit sits so snug on the sides and the top. When I take them off, the mark that's left on the nose is on the sides and the top (unlike metal frames where the nosepads only make the mark on the sides). Other plastic frames also sit on the sides of my nose. But my drop temples sit on the entire nose. That's what makes them so comfy. I've tried on other drop temples but they didn't have the same effect. </p><p> </p><p>Yes, they do suit me, but am reluctant to wear them out as they are fairly large. I remember when I took the frames to the staff and said I want these, she just looked at me as asked if I'm sure I want them. I got embarrased and my face went red. She appologised for making me feel uncomfortable and said that she'll get them made up. If she didn't appologise and run off with them, I think I would have changed my mind. I don't regret getting them at all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2003, 04:26</p><p>It would be a dull world if everyone liked the same thing. But I have to say that I never liked the drop temple style, nor the huge plastic frames in bright colours which preceded them. These made the wearers look silly and the drop temples (IMHO) make the wearer look somewhat old-fashioned. </p><p>I know that lenses will tend to be thicker in these large frames, but you can see the edge thickness much better in the more delicate and elegant frames which are currently popular. </p><p>Further, I believe the popularity of small oval , rimless and semi-rimless styles has resulted in a swing back from contact lenses to glasses amongst young women (not young men, though, I fear glasses are seen as 'wimpish' in the current macho culture). This is because they enhance the appearance of many and have enabled lightweight styles and are seen as both fashionable and comfortable.  </p><p>I was recently at a wedding where several of the young women wore glasses in their finery and looked absolutely splendid. I don't think that would have happened in drop temple days. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Martha-Jayne</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2003, 04:21</p><p>There was a commercial during the 1970's, I believe, where a young woman was speaking about herself being fashionable from the shoes on up, but when the camera reached her face, she said sadly, "So where did I go wrong?"  She was wearing clunky black frames with rhinestones on the front.  Then a male voice said, "Fashion doesn't stop at the neck[line].  You've got to wear the right glasses."  Then the commercial shows her in many different large, colorful, mostly drop-temple frames.  As she touches one of them while winking at an interested guy, she then purred, "Who says girls with glasses don't get passes?  It just depends on their frames!" </p><p> </p><p>Sorry the post is rather long, but that ad basically cinched my wanting to buy drop-temples when it became time to wear glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

I've been reading here endlessly on a weekly basis, but have not posted anything only because I have nothing really that much to say. </p><p> </p><p>Since the topic of 'drop-temples' came up again, I'll only say that I wear drop-temple frames. I'm 26 years old now. My prescription is about -3. I only wear those at home when no-one is about. I love them because they are so comfortable on my nose and ears. I usually tend to forget they are on since the frames are a larger than what is out there now. </p><p> </p><p>I have the normal trendy everyday pair that I wear out to work and about. But once I get home I take them off and put the drop temples on. Call me mad, but I love them. </p><p> </p><p>I only accidently wore them out to go to the local store once as I forgot to take them off. I only realised when the store owner asked about them. My face went bright red as I realised they were on. I made the excuse that they were my mothers and mine broke. Since then, never have I been caught.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Leon</b>&nbsp;26 May 2003, 02:28</p><p>As you probably know, a lot of eyewear trends come from Italy. I talked to an Italian designer recently and he had some interesting things to say: </p><p> </p><p>1. Translucent or transparant plastic frames are very hip in Italy right now. These frames are mostly squarish, sometimes with rounded edged.  </p><p>2. Rimless frames are still OK, but only if the frame parts have a striking (bright) colour, such as red, purple or yellow. </p><p>3. Lenses with fashion tints are still hip (pink, yellow, blue and so on). </p><p>4. Drop temples are definitely coming back. Many Italian manufacturers offer the coolest drom temple frames now. </p><p>5. Big is beautiful. </p><p>6. Round frame shapes are coming back in fashion.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2003, 08:08</p><p>And in today's Evening Standard, a report on celebs and the way oversized sunglasses are coming back into fashion. All good news for me, anyway. It seems that at last the irritating teeny-tiny-frame fad is coming to an end, yippie!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2003, 07:06</p><p>Over the last few months I've seen a slight but noticable return to what I've always thought as "Real" glasses, sensibly sized, sort of midway between 80's oversized and recent teeny-sized, and more rounded and less angular.  </p><p> </p><p>Even ordinary type lenses seem to be appearing again on those that previously wore thin lenses, very strange but very encouraging. Perhaps the thin-lens craze is slowing down, but perhaps just for those with weaker prescriptions where it really does not really make a big difference?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2003, 14:43</p><p>UnixGuy -- I would think that if you ask at an optical shop, they could probably supply something suitable...they will usually tint lenses as desired.

<p><b>Fildar</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2003, 14:03</p><p>Sorry!  I guess the below post should've been put under "Psychology Of Glasses", instead.  Seeing Lore's post mentioning aviator glasses just got me thinking.. and posting..</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fildar</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2003, 13:40</p><p>I'd like to see a psychological study be conducted somewhere (I should've thought of this when I was taking Psychology classes 8 years ago).  Call it a "First Impressions" case study... </p><p> </p><p>Basically, you fill a room with people, and show pictures of people on a slide projector, assuring the viewers that the pictures were taken recently.  Then, the participants have to immediately write down what they think of the person whose picture they're currently viewing.  They have to draw conclusions based only on appearance (you know, like, the way it typically happens in real life? :)). </p><p> </p><p>They'd be given 5 minutes to write down things like what they think of the person's overall appearance, what that person probably does for a living, whether or not they think he or she is involved in a romantic relationship, etc. </p><p> </p><p>I wonder this, as I've shared in this forum before about my college days, when I used to wear my +4 large, square, plastic-frame reading glasses around school.  This was the early- and mid-90's, so they were a bit out of style.  But being Optic-Obssessive, that was part of the joy of the experience :) </p><p> </p><p>I often wonder what the women in my classes who saw me wearing those glasses every day really truly thought of me and my "look". </p><p> </p><p>I've posted my picture on "Hot Or Not", and my rating has been hovering around a 5.5 to 5.7.  Apparently, I have gotten some "10" ratings from a couple of people, which is very interesting, unless they were just joking around.... </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132717/http://www.hotornot.com/r/?eid=KUGRKYE&amp;key=BCY" target="_blank">http://www.hotornot.com/r/?eid=KUGRKYE&amp;key;=BCY</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2003, 06:56</p><p>As to the "small and narrow" glasses, I'd say don't look a gift-horse in the mouth :).  There are plenty of people, myself included, who would be wearing contacts instead of glasses if the kind of larger frames that used to be popular were all that was available.  I've actually found that, in most places where I've bought glasses, a variety of frames have been available, in all sizes and materials.  I think most people, right now, just gravitate toward smaller frames, and I have no doubt that the move toward making smaller frames (which are in turn less heavy and less thick) has induced a lot of people to wear glasses or (if they'd previously worn contacts) return to wearing glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I think the presence of very large aviator glasses for men in every optical shop I've ever been to backs up my theory that it's not the supply that determining people's glasses, but taste.  I always see a dozen or so pairs of extremely large aviator glasses when I choose frames for myself.  And yet, with all of their availability, I've never seen anyone under the age of 40 or so wearing them.  All of the guys who wear glasses that I see on campus wear small (generally small wire or semi-rimless) frames.  It doesn't have to do with supply, clearly, but with taste: just like they aren't going to wear plaid golf pants, they aren't going to wear very large glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Plus, once again, the practicality issue.  I really liked the drop temples that were just posted, for example, but if I were to get something like that, it would be in brown or black, not lavendar, for reasons of practicality.  I wear my glasses every day, and I need a pair that will go reasonably well with pretty much all of the clothes I own.  In most cases, small, unobtrusive frames, or larger frames in more sedate colors, are much more practical than large, colorful frames.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2003, 02:30</p><p>I see more variety of styles in provincial "backwater" towns now than I did a couple of years ago. But around here (London) it's still a bit stuck with the small and narrow stuff.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2003, 19:39</p><p>I usually hate drop temples, but I actually really liked the Guess ones.  So, perhaps modernized--a little bit smaller and less either fully round or fully square, like they used to see to be--they'd make a comeback.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2003, 18:00</p><p>I've been seeing a return of the medium to large round wire frame among the twenty-something set. Kind of funny to see that style come back after just a few years hiatus. </p><p> </p><p>I wonder why? Maybe these folks are hearing that larger frames are coming back into fashion and round wires are the style in that category they are most familiar with. </p><p> </p><p>I'm not crazy about the aesthetics of round wires, but I like the visible lens edge they often reveal.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2003, 08:38</p><p>Tony - While rimless glasses were popular quite a while ago, they weren't the same then as they are now.  I think that's going to be true for any style that becomes popular.  It can "be retro", but if it really just feels like "the 40's" or "the 60's", it's not going to be popular.   </p><p> </p><p>My black plastic horn-rimmed glasses don't look all that much like anything you could get in the middle of the 20th century (and I'm glad about that).  </p><p> </p><p>I do think cateyes and buddy-holly's have, in a sense, started making a comeback.  But only sort of.  Drop temples, too, perhaps -- given the link that was posted a while back (maybe on seen-on-the-web).  Those weren't your mother's drop temples!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2003, 07:01</p><p>I like the current trend towards frameless glasses. they look so cool and you can see the true thickness of the lens. A bit like having all the icecream and not needing the cone that contains it. </p><p> </p><p>In contrast I also think that Buddy Holly styles for men and Catseyes for women are very sexy. </p><p> </p><p>It's interesting that the current frameless styles are by no means new and were very popular in the forties. Remember the Glen miller glasses look! </p><p> </p><p>What do other people think about this? </p><p> </p><p>Also will Buddy Holly frames and Catseyes ever come back? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2002, 03:41</p><p>I wonder how long it will take to get the preceding post deleted</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2002, 22:04</p><p>Thanks for the instructions, OGL. I found both of them. Your wife is fortunate to be able to choose three new pairs of glasses at once. </p><p> </p><p>I looked further at the site and was also surprised to find some frames that look exactly like mine (Vogue 3246) although I did not get them from Lenscrafters. All I have been able to read on my frame is that they were made in France, and I recall my optician saying something about a brand name "ABC"? I have never paid much attention to the brand names and designer names on eyeglass frames, but as with the rest of the material objects in life, everything now has to have a recognizable or "designer" name. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2002, 09:11</p><p>Much to my surprise, I did find a place where you can see 2 of the 3 finalists for my wife's new ones.  Go to the Lenscrafter site, click on Product Information. Mark the blanks All Styles, Plastic, Geometric, Oval, Rectangular and on the right highlight Vogue, then Search. Do the same highlighting Anne Klein also. When Vogue comes up there'll be thumbnails, double click on 2203; on Anne Klein double click on 8014.  They're not perfect, but will give you a pretty good idea.  The third one was a Guess which they don't carry.  Found my way backwards to this site through a good old Google search.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2002, 06:19</p><p>Forgot to answer the other part of the question re progressives.  My lab has 22 different "brands" in CR-39 alone, trial and error of course works as they will replace any orders within a year for change of scrip or non-adaptation or any other customer service issue but I try not to abuse that privilege. They are real nice people to deal with so I try to return the favor.  Probably the best thing is to find an optician you trust, don't be afraid to ask if they are ABO, and have a nice discussion about the various designs. If they have experience in the field, they will be knowledgable enough to explain the pros and cons of the various designs. </p><p>Speaking of labs, one thing I miss (about the only thing) about being back up north is being able to drop by that lab to drop off and pick up my orders personally and shoot the breeze with the general manager and the lab manager.  They are busy, but didn't mind chatting while they worked.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2002, 06:10</p><p>Portia: being computer illiterate and not having vast amounts of time to explore the next, I don't really know where to tell you to look for these frames.  I don't have access to a digital camera or I'd post pix, but in any event a photo doesn't do these justice, you have to see them for real and turn them various directons to catch the ambient light to show off the depth of color of the dark parts and then show off the subtle blue outlines.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2002, 11:45</p><p>Any chance of posting on T.G.W.G. site?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2002, 10:28</p><p>OK, here's the latest update on Mrs. OGL's next glasses, we've selected a frame using some of the ideas y'all presented earlier.  These will basically be a replacement for her "house" glasses, although of course she will integrate them into her eyewear wardrobe.  Her "house" glasses are dark blue metal Giorgio Armani's, and the color has been scratched/rubbed so she basically wears them around the house and wants something with blue in it for outside wear.  Her specifications were they had to be both dressy and casual (!) and she was very receptive to plastic.  After getting the info on available Trivex progressive lens designs, we narrowed it down to (a) a Guess rectangle in solid dark blue which was discarded as too casual, (b) an Anne Klein modified rectangle in dark reddish amber with light blue zyl laminate behind the eyewire and the winner: a Vogue 2203, 47 eyesize with about a 26 B measurement.  This makes it a small rectangle, dark brown as the predominant color but with a two-tone laminate behind the eyewire, the backside of which is light tan clear zyl and the middle color is clear blue zyl.  When you look at if from the front, especially from a slight angle, the blue is a nice subtle outline around the edge of the eyewire, she really looks nice in them. </p><p>The Trivex is made by Younger Optics, and their progressive design is called Image.  She has adapted well to that design in her polarized sunglasses which have about the same B measurement so I think she'll be just fine in about an 18 seg height.  This only leaves 8 mm of distance, but as mentioned, this works in her Armani suns as well as the VIP's in her Ungaros. </p><p>Trivex has an Abbe value of 45 and an index of 1.53 while her HI has an Abbe of 36 and an index of 1.56.  She is a polycarb non-adapt which I suspect is because of it's Abbe of only 29 so I think the Trivex will be the answer. Interestingly, the Trivex is actuall lighter in weight even though the index is slighly less than HI because of it's high density.  If this works, it will prove to me that Trivex is superior to poly.  Of course, she doesn't know this aspect of the glasses, she just wants the new frames! </p><p>The order is being mailed to the lab today, will post the results when they are in.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2002, 08:31</p><p>What makes you think this settles the discussion? 8&lt;) From an optician's point of view, they'd be a nightmare to rx, unless they have eyewire screws that can't be seen in the photo.  A "rigid" plastic frame can have lenses inserted by heating &amp; gently stretching the plastic.  These would have no give at all, the lens would have to be the perfect fit and even then insertion would be very difficult.  That's why most of the wooden frames you see have wooden temples only, or at the most wooden trim on the frame front.</p><p></p><hr>

In a recent trade journal Smilen Eyewear advertised their Sabatini 2 featuring West African Wood temples, no less, and Roi Eyewear of Scottsdale AZ has licensed and is distributing Bulova brand Exclusively Wood.  Roi has a website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132717/http://eyewearbyroi.com/" target="_blank">http://eyewearbyroi.com</a> but interestingly enough under their Bulova section they don't mention the wood templed variety.  Maybe it hasn't been updated for awhile. </p><p>Don't know what part of the globe you're from, but in the U.S. we lag behind Europe in cutting edge eyewear, so I would suspect that it's been available over there for a longer period of time than her.

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2002, 15:18</p><p>Squabella - I'd expect there to be some problems with wooden frames.  But it would be great if you could post some pictures of the ones you get! </p><p> </p><p>Gary - since "normal" has varied tremendously over the years, and since lens thickness is really quite sensitive to the size of a frame (compared to the wearer's PD), there is a pretty wide range of possibilities.  But I have a pair in that range and I'd say most frames are going to land between 4 and 7 mm thick (give or take one)...bottom line: they'll be substantially thick, but not extremely thick. </p><p>  (On the other hand, I have a pair of -6's in polycarbonate and a recent two-tone plastic frame.  You can't see the lens thickness at all; they might as well be plano as far as the thickness goes.) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2002, 10:46</p><p>Charlotte: if they are properly adjusted, the small buttons should be no problem, I have them on mine. But make sure you get the soft silicon jobbies, they stay up better with less pressure on the nose.

Vas ist los? </p><p>To all the others, thanks for your advice, for the most part this was the direction I was going.  There's one particualar Anne Klein I have in mind that also looks black but has inlaid colors as well.  She's definitely over 30, but looks good in younger styles, here's my dilemma.  The better looking plastic frames have a short B measurement, and I don't yet know the fitting height on Trivex.  In an AO Compact or such I only need 14-15 mm to get the progressive seg in, but the other designs need a minimum of 18 mm &amp; currently in her Sola VIP she's at 19 mm which is pushing it.  All I know about Trivex so far are the technical optical qualities of the material, am going to have to find out what the manufacturer(s) recommend for seg fitting.  If they can't go up to about an 18, 19 would be better, the plastic frames I've got in mind won't work. Will keep you informed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Charlotte</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2002, 10:07</p><p>Hi all, </p><p> </p><p>I have been wearing glasses for the past two years and have just got my prescription upped to about -3.5 at a checkup a few days ago.  Right now, I have my eyes on a pair of dark navy retangular metal frames with circular nose pads. </p><p> </p><p>I thought they looked fabulous on me at the optical, and they fit quite well too, but am wondering if slippage would be a big factor once the lens are fitted in.  Do you think I should stick with the more traditional nose pieces (which of course have a larger area), or does it really make that much of a difference?  Thanks!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pete</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2002, 04:48</p><p>OGL Mrs OGL sounds like the perfect candidate for black or dark brown plastics, Mrs Pete who also wears glasses ALL the time shifted into plastics a while back and loves them, she has ten pairs one for almost every occasion and five of them are plastic which she now tends to wear mostly. She is blonde long hair and green/aqua eyes and the plastics are quite a statement. She has one pair of plastis that look black but change color from every angle so cool, we can't disclose her age (though fear of retribution) but just lets say she has progressives!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2002, 03:28</p><p>You have got me sussed OGL:)   Peter </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2002, 13:55</p><p>OGL, </p><p> </p><p>If she were under 30, I'd say plastic is an almost-obvious choice.  I'm not sure exactly how old she is (you needn't say), but a little older I suspect.  But even so, I think you can promote plastic to her as being quite popular now and not requiring or indicating the boldness it used to.  And in the script, CR39 might show a little edge even in plastic, so the hot new material might be a good way to go.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2002, 11:47</p><p>She's around a -4.75 -1.50, and thick edges don't bother her but as she's my showcase (you'd be amazed at the number of customer's I've gotten because people have noticed her various glasses) I want to go with what's popular. The gap in her wardrobe is plastic, and she has a nice bridge on her nose that lends itself to a good fit, but I don't know if she's bold enough to try it.....that's one reason I'm soliciting input.  She wears glasses ALL the time and is truly "wardrobed", she wears each pair on the appropriate occasion, she has her favorites for at home, some for work, some for extreme dress occasions, etc.  Her rx sun are a #3 brown polarized for bright days, and a #2 brown CR39 for hazier days.  Interestingly, one of her favorites are metal frames that "make a statement", dark blue Giorgio Armani ovals, so maybe it won't be such a leap to plastic.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2002, 18:44</p><p>I don't remember her prescription...that will say something about the frame choice if you want to showcase this new material.  Yeah, plastic doesn't show off high index material well at all in minus scripts (unless the script is monstrous).  Metal frames are the best way to show off high-index, in my opinion.  (Rimless glasses don't need to be thin - in fact, I think they look better if they aren't, though if they are thin they should be really light.) </p><p> </p><p>Does she wear all the different frames at different times?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2002, 18:40</p><p>I really like plastic, and that seems to be the gap in her glasses wardrobe.  Plus I'm sure you can get the shape right (usually when plastic doesn't work well for someone, it's because the shape isn't quite right and plastic makes that more dramatic, I think).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Leon</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2002, 11:56</p><p>OGL, I'd say: get Rim Titanium (by Lindberg), the 'Kella' frames are quite beautiful. Be sure to choose the dark purple rim. </p><p> </p><p>My wife is blonde and blue-eyed too and she looks fantastic in those purple rimmed frames! (By the way, her lenses are CR-39 and I love that!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2002, 11:48</p><p>A tongue in cheek answer in my last post to the Love Of The Lens thread got me thinking.  It's been 6 months now since Mrs. OGL got a new pair, so she's due.  There's a relatively new lens material out called Trivex marketed as either Phoenix or Trilogy that I've been wanting to try and maybe this would be the opportunity.  She's a polycarb nonadapt, and Trivex has a high Abbe value and high index, maybe it's the answer.  The question is, what frame?  She has 5 metal in various colors and shapes, 1 semirimless and 1 drill mount.  I was thinking (to showcase the Trivex material) about a screwless drill mount Silhouette or Air Titanium.  She is very fair complected, very blue eyed, and very blonde, so I may try making a statement with dark earthtone or two tone plastic.  How about some opinions from the posters?  And Peter, your vote has already been recorded.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Daffy</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2002, 16:15</p><p>Are the drop-temples back in? Well I went to an optical chain in sydney (australia) just to see what was on the shelves. What I saw took me by suprise! There were a few frames in the 'what's new' section that were 'drop-temples'!!! They were metal frames, small, oval-ish. Nothing i've seen before! I'm just wondering when I will see them on peoples faces...not too long i hope.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2002, 07:00</p><p>Ahh,my dearest Portia: thank you for the opening.  You didn't broadcast it "far and wide", wide and thick would be better terms.  It's just a matter of physical optics that lens size coupled with the material to whatever extent makes the lenses appear thicker and stronger.  For those of you who have never been in a lab, you would be amazed to see a 76 mm finished -4.00 or so blank; the edges are THICK but when edged into a small oval frame basically disappear.  From a purely selfish point of view, the 70's and 80's frames made it very easy to be a human lensometer because they stuck out far enough from the cheeks that I could always get a good peek through them at the target object, and were almost universally CR-39 so the index was standard. </p><p>Having mentioned index, I don't have any hard proof of this but I suspect that the numbers we use as benchmarks such as 1.47 for CR-39 and 1.53 for crown glass aren't always accurate. I suspect that the lower end opticals buy cheap and in bulk and therefor have a lesser quality product that may have a lower index than the above.  In-store labs (read: one hour places)love the new small frames, as they no longer have to stock the 80 mm blanks, 70 &amp; 76 mm will nearly always do it. </p><p>One of the reasons why my !@#$^%&amp; collection is over 500 and growing is because I have this list of "untouchables" that I won't sell at any price, and unfortunately, I've classified too many of them as such. Two illustrate the above point: I have a pair of silver aviators, mint condition, with glass lenses that weigh a ton and appear to be at least -3.50. They even fooled me, imagine my surprise when I put them on my real lenso and found them to be -1.50 sphere OU!  A great pair for GOC as I can see pretty well without them and more than one latent myope has discovered how clear things are through them!  The other pair is a classic early 80's Tura unisex, black with some silver trim at the temples, in a 59 eye, 56 B measurement, and 62 ED (diagonal) which makes for very sharp corners.  They are CR-39 with unpolished edges, look to be over -5.00, in reality they are -2.75 sphere with about -1.00 cyl for wear when I want the world to think I'm a flaming myope! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;09 Oct 2002, 22:39</p><p>Oh dear, OGL. Did we all exagerate our prescriptions back in the 80's?  </p><p> </p><p>I remember being told that every frame I ever chose called for oversize (an extra cost) lenses. </p><p> </p><p>We didn't know enough then to realize that our fashionable large lenses broadcast our prescriptions far and wide. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;07 Oct 2002, 07:03</p><p>Gloria is a myope (now presbyopic myope) of low proportions.  I remember very early on some great photos of her that allowed me to get a good fix on her scrip, she's in the -2.00 to -2.50 range.  The reason why she wore those big aviators was protest, in those days women intentionally went ugly to the point of wearing men's frames to protest this, that, and the other thing.  Her aviators, both rimmed and rimless were her signature.  I thought it must have been hilarious, her posing (and she could do it very well) as a Playboy bunny and then putting on aviators when she was out of costume. The reason why she looks more myopic than she really is comes from the size and shape of the frame and the CR-39 which is 1.47 index material.</p><p></p><hr>

I of course had to do some glasseswatching while over there. The huge trend over there was rimless or semi-rimless, and almost nothing else.  I found it very interesting.  It would have been cool to go into a few optical shops, but I didn't have time, or want to bore my husband.

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2002, 11:13</p><p>One more time on older rimless/semi: I went back and found my cousin's 1948 high school yearbook from our tiny Iowa town, and it was interesting. In the senior class of about 15 girls, 3 of them wore glasses. Two were just plain clear plastic and one was an octagonal semi.  One who was not wearing any at all came back years later (I was in 2d grade at the time) as my music teacher and by then she was wearing low minus semis. Have had many fantasies over her based on a one on one encounter with her as a 7th grader but that's another story.  The faculty had a group picture, there were 10 females and 3 of them wore glasses all 3 of which were octagonal semi's.  Unfortunately, the yearbooks then jumped to my frosh year which was 1955, but even at that those 4 years provide an interesting insight into the progression of frames over the years, especially when I add them to the next 6 years of college and grad school yearbooks.  All in all, they span from 1948 until 1964 and the pictures tell quite a story.  The times they have been a 'changin.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2002, 08:08</p><p>I think rimless glasses with an AR coating make for a great back-up alternative for people who usually wear contacts lenses. For that off day when you get up too late, or run low on solution of you feel an eye infection comming on. Rimless glasses hardly alter your appearance and are "invisable" from a distance. You may not even get those annoying, "I never knew you wore glasses" remarks. Some people may just question to you or just to themselves: gee you look different today, what is it? Once you have returned to your contacts, few people will remember your day in glasses because people mostly remember colors and shapes, as well as tastes and smells.

<p><b>S-type</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2002, 13:18</p><p>Back in HS in the '70's metal frames were all the rage. With the round John Lennon style the most popular for both boys and girls. Once in a while someone, usually a girl would break away from the pack and wear a plastic frame. It would be a large Dorothy Hammil oversized frame. However there were two girls then chose rimless glasses. There were no semi rimless then with fish line holding things in place. It was drill mounts and screws only. Thinking back, those two girls were really hot in thier nearly invisable peepers.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2002, 18:42</p><p>S-type: you're absolutely right.....my black frames look horrible with my blue dress 8&lt;)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>S-type</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2002, 16:21</p><p>I think the whole thing with the rimless or semi's is that they go with anything as far as fashion goes. this is much more important for women than men. A pair of black frames might not "go" with a blue dress (example). But with rimless its not a factor. Of course today almost every glasses wearer also has contact lenses  for that special occassion.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2002, 14:48</p><p>Clare - Well that was sure fast!  </p><p> </p><p>  Seriously, though, I agree about plastics offering more of a 'real look'.  I've had more people tell me that my rimless ones are invisible than I've had people say they like them.  Plastics are really visible, and I think they assert (very clearly) that one's glasses are an expression of style.  Metal frames, semi- and rimless glasses -- even if they aren't purely aiming at the "as invisible as possible" goal -- seem to say "I have to wear glasses, and I'm trying not to let that damage my appearance."  If a person is wearing plastic frames, in most cases they obviously could have chosen something less dramatic.  (For strong myopes, though, plastics can definitely do a lot to keep the strength of the lenses from being overbearing.) </p><p>   One thing that seems to be pretty different between your experience and mine is that essentially *NO ONE* comments on my glasses.  I mean, I wore my new, very bold black plastic pair all last weekend and none of my friends said a thing.  My girlfriend did say "cool glasses" when she first saw them, but I think she was pretty shocked, as she didn't know they were coming.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2002, 14:21</p><p>Alan - okay I'm prepared to be convinced otherwise!  Out with a friend of mine at the weekend, I did a spot of spex shopping which was unusual for me because I've always gone on my own. She was lamenting needing a test (she's a mild hyperope who's had glasses for ten years and worn them little - although as we no longer work together I'm not sure if that's true, but she seems to be able to read without them still). She was looking at some Georgio Armani semi-rimless and I took the opportunity to peruse the plastic display (ever-keen to broaden my horizons!). Cutting the long story short, I ordered a pair of black plastic (yes, ehpc - black frames, blonde hair!!) in a not-too narrow rectangular frame.  Although I can't remember now how good they looked in the shop, I think they'll be okay.  And it may be that the difference will be so startling that I'll actually think that they enhance my appearance.   Perhaps its a case that the everso-light Lindbergs, though stylish, don't make a major contribution to a *look* of any sort.  I'd like that - a real *look*.  More later ...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2002, 09:49</p><p>S-type, lemme add one more thing re your comment "until a new design comes along".  One of the beautiful aspects of a drill mount is the flexibility. Quite often, I'll show a lady several different demo frames, tell her to select the bridge and temples (even mix and match if she likes) and then have her try on a variety of ALL frames and then select the shape and size lens. In effect, she's customizing her glasses and every such pair is a new design.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2002, 09:44</p><p>You guys are going to think I'm some kind of undying advocate for semi's and drill, but not so, just saying it as I see it.  Having qualified that, I think we're seeing two different demographics. Wurm, you may be observing the young and hip crowd and are probably right. But in the industry, there's the other 95% of the world and they're still exceptionally strong with no foreseeable let up. As I posted elsewhere (I think) there are two main ways to style frames, the make a statement way ("hey, look at me, I'm wearing glasses and it's cool") and the "give me the closest to no glasses at all look" with of course shades of gray in between each.  A lot of first timers don't want the rims both for cosmetics and so they don't see them through the glasses. Etc., etc., keep adding up the reasons and semi's will be around for a long time even though the young and hip will keep "discovering and discarding". S-type, as far as value goes, that's not a player if you shop right.  A good pair of semi's with a poly carb lens, a Perry Ellis or a Vittadini for example, can be bought at a chain for under $200 and I can sell the same ones for $90. Or, when Lenscrafters for example has a $99 sale you can get a CR-39 with scratch coat and what they call an LC Basic or MK semirimless for that amount. And finally, Billie Jean; yeah, she wore those after the old plastics she wore when she first hit the big time tennis scene, and I have that frame in my collection in a -5.00 or so. But, I seem to remember hers had cable temples and mine have skull temples although if I really was worried about authenticity I could put on some cable from a different pair. They are fun to wear from time to time (GOC of course) in casual cloths, can't </p><p>wear them with a suit and tie because then I do look like McNamara or Rummy. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2002, 07:57</p><p>Former tennis pro Billie Jean King was/ is a wearer of rimless frame glasses. They are known as a "three piece set" [two tempeles and the bridge] and with octagonal lenses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2002, 07:10</p><p>Clare, </p><p>   In light of your perspective on plastic versus metal or rimless frames, I had a very ironic experience last night -- I was talking to my girlfriend about my new plastic frames compared to the rimless pair I've had for a while.  She said she likes them both, but the plastic ones have a lot more personality whereas the rimless ones seem more serious -- so if I'm having a meeting with my boss or something, I should probably avoid the plastic ones.   </p><p>   Looking around at who I see wearing plastic frames the most, I'd say plastic gives the impression of someone young and quite "in style".  They seem to be appropriate anywhere for women.  One key for women, in my opinion, is to avoid a shape that is too angular and gives a more masculine and serious appearance...this applies to all types of frames, but it's more glaring with plastic frames because the frames are more obvious.  All in all, it's probably more important to get the shape right with plastic frames than with others.  I don't think my rimless glasses are quite the right shape, for example, but it doesn't matter as much because it's hard to see the edge of the glasses most of the time anyway, as there is no frame. </p><p>   Bottom line -- at least where I am (Eastern US, mostly around either middle-aged engineers or young professionals), there's nothing "serious" about plastic frames, in general. In fact, I'd say the opposite is more often the case.  But this may vary depending on where a person is.  Look around and see what people are wearing and what looks good.  And then what looks good on *you* depends on the size and shape of your face.  I do think it's good, though, not to judge prematurely.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>S-type</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2002, 03:02</p><p>yes it seems rimless and to a lesser extent semi's have run their course. for now at least until a new design for them comes along. also they are more expensive to buy and repair and are not as durable as frame glasses. in these economic times value rules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2002, 11:04</p><p>OGL, sales of rimless may be peaking, but my impression is that they have gone cold as a trend. The two factors may be associated -- sort of like the musical group that gets popular and alienates the fans who originally "discovered" it. </p><p> </p><p>I am, right this minute, wearing a pair of Sferoflex semirimless so don't think I'm trying to play fashion dictator.  </p><p>Personally I'm a big believer in "wear whatever looks good on you" but trends have a big impact on what I see others wearing, hence my interest.</p><p></p><hr>

Limited usually to Catholic Nuns and secretaries of Defence, ie: Rumsfield and McNamara and also worn by people who spend a little too much time at the YMCA/YWCA. LOL! But semi-rimless is another story. They are more durable than rimless and come in many more variations in style,color and materials used. Semi's are even made in plastic.  </p><p> </p><p>A lot of young girls amd some not so young are going with full plastic frames det to their maximum style effect on the face. metal is more minimal on facial features. Semi's and true rimless even more so.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2002, 12:03</p><p>S-type and Fathom: you're pretty much right on in your plastic/metal observations.  Wurm, it may be regional, but I don't see the semi trend fading at all, if anything it's getting stronger through drill mounts. Was in Chicago for Eyequest, and semi's &amp; drills were everywhere. Silhouette has the flagship frames, and one new vendor has a line of stainless and titanium knockoffs that are so fabulous and well priced I would've bought some for my business inventory were it not for the fact we were in the process of moving. If have a lot of semis and drills even as it is, and in the last year fitted many everywhere from young 20's to mid-50's (femmes, of course). At the chain store fitted at least three semis per shift (we didn't do drills)once to a delightful little 10 year old with a blue fashion tint for her very first glasses! Would be in Vegas as we speak at Vision Expo West were it not for some bad luck, but Lenslover is there and he'll report back.  The trade journals still feature them very heavily.  As an aside, I have some REAL semi's, from the 40's, in a -5.00 CR-39, 56 eyesize, talk about thick!  At Eyequest in the Silhoutte booth they had a small oval drill mount for show, -7.00 OU wiht a 1.71 HI and they were absolutely gorgeous (by normal optical standards, that is), the lenses were very thin and looked like crystal jewelry. Clare: not all plastics are heavy, I've got several including some Emporio's like I mentioned earlier along with some Vogue and Georgio Armani's that are very thing black plastic and very flattering. My wife's Ungaro's that I mentioned in a different post are a dark bronze wide rectangle, and metal, a fine pair of glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2002, 06:24</p><p>There is something new called lasEk that is for people with thin or flat corneas. Its like a cross between lasIk and prk. It employs a much finer flap cut into the epedermal layer only. Also PRK is available to you. Both lasEk and prk have longer healing times than lasIk.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>S-type</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2002, 05:09</p><p>I don't think LASIK will ever be the "standard" for vision correction. Just as Contacts are not the standerd. Glasses continue to be. Lasik isn't for everybody. It is not effective for high plus or minus Rx's and the same is true for astigmatism, presbyopia and those needing prism correction. I myself cannot have it because I have flat corneas with my hyperopia and astig. not to mention shallow pockets. LOL</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GwGs</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2002, 03:27</p><p>Agreed Wurm, you look at nearly any young person now and they have rectangular plastic frames on that are usually black rimmed - there are thousands of frames to choose from so why go for the most boring ones? </p><p> </p><p>It would be fantastic if drop temples made a comeback, only time will tell i suppose but with Lasik becoming more popular and no doubt cheaper, how many people are going to choose to wear spex if they can afford Lasik?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2002, 00:38</p><p>Rimless seems to be fading fast as a trend, but I'm sure it will always be a good fallback "barely there" option for us more mature folks ;-) </p><p> </p><p>I would agree that the young gals seem to be all in plastic these days -- typically a black or perhaps laminate frame in some smallish and fairly wide shape. I suspect we'll see kids experimenting more and more with larger shapes over the next couple of years.  </p><p> </p><p>I am curious to see the extent to which the new drop temples take hold. The industry has pushed them to a surprising (to me) extent, but adoption seems a bit slow. I do think they look sensational on those who I've seen wearing them: the shapes are very sleek. I have wondered if the market would prefer drops that stick more strictly to retro appeal: big clunky decorative 80s things. Time will tell I suppose. </p><p> </p><p>Looking ahead, I'm beginning to think that in the next few years we will go through a period of eyewear that appears inspired by Gaudi -- strange shapes, an emphasis on craftsmanship and attention to multiple colors. An organic art deco movement, if you will. In that kind of design environment, we'd see groundbreaking styles but undoubtedly some real ugly stuff as well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fathom</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2002, 18:37</p><p>Clare, my thinking actually runs along the same line as yours, but the women in my univeristy campus (over 30,000 students, so there's a LOT to see) seem to think otherwise. </p><p> </p><p>Plastic seems to be the material of choice for the 'fashionable' set -- those dressed in the fashion du jour and who you know spend considerable time in front of the vanity in the mornings.  If they're going for the trendy, fun look, almost inevitably they're in plastic frames.  From my observations I'd say that around 80% of the fashionable types wear plastic; the other 20% go for metal.  For those who seem more serious and don't pay as much attention appearance-wise, around 90% are in metal frames. </p><p> </p><p>For some reason, for the guys the reverse seems to be true. </p><p> </p><p>I'm of course observing only from an image point-of-view, as I've no idea which of these glasses-wearers are actually serious and studious and which aren't!  (Not to mention those who are BOTH fashionable and studious.)  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>S-type</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2002, 15:04</p><p>Plastic seems more serious I think because your first glasses as a kid were plastic. Just being told at age 10 that you wll have to wear these strange things on your face to be able to see as well asyour friends and for the rest of your life is "serious". And starting school is a seriou time and your parents kept telling you to be careful with your glasses, that they cost mommy and daddy lots of money, is all serious. Latter as a teen you got "cool" metal frames like some famous Rock star wears or you meet someone of the opposite sex who wears them and suddenly having to wear glasses is not so serious anymore. Its just the way I see it. No pun intended</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2002, 14:07</p><p>Alan, continuing my comments about plastic frames on this thread then. Okay this may be completely irrational, but this is my thinking - feel free to try and convince me otherwise.  Somehow it seems to me that plastic frames are more business-like than metal frames. Hence I can imagine wearing plastic for work for that *professional* and serious look, but not for social occasions or weekends when I'd want a less business-like look.  Does that sound like nonsense to you? </p><p> </p><p>Interesting what you observe about rimless.  I think they can be difficult to get right - some people really look stunning, on me they disappear to the extent that they look less flattering than something more visible.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2002, 13:41</p><p>Hmm...not a popular thread, even though the topic is popular.  Come on, folks...use this one.  ;) </p><p> </p><p>I spent a week in Washington, D.C, a couple weeks ago.  I was amazed at how many pairs of rimless glasses I saw.  I'd say they were several times more common there than they are in Philadelphia -- just a couple hours away.  Pretty surprising. </p><p> </p><p>There was a post a couple days ago, in Seen on the Web, about Yana's plastic glasses versus the metal ones.  Plastic does seem to have gotten a lot more fashionable on yound women, doesn't it?  That doesn't seem so true for men, though.  I wonder why that is.  </p><p> </p><p>I bought a pair of black plastic frames from 39dollarglasses.com, which came last Friday.  First off, they're really great; they fit a lot better than I might have expected, and they look pretty good, I think.  (It's kind of embarrassing that they cost about 10% - I'm not kidding - of what my last pair cost.)  It's also interesting how NOT strong they look.  I got them made with a prescription around -6, but none of the tell-tale signs of 'strong glasses' are obtrusive at all.  And even on close inspection, it's hard to detect any thickness to the lenses (which are polycarbonate -- thinner, but not extremely).  I was surprised at how dramatic this effect was. </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;30 Aug 2002, 12:04</p><p>OGL, </p><p>   Are these available already?  Who makes them?  I've heard of 30-day extended wear lenses (PureVision and some other one) -- same thing, or different?  I'm interested in reading some about them.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;29 Aug 2002, 18:11</p><p>Bilbo: yeah, I've kind of been in on the ground floor of this development through a doc friend who's very renowned in the industry and who told me about them nearly a year ago. It's the CL industry response to Lasik, trying to market a product that will keep people in CL's and away from the cutting edge, if you'll excuse the pun. Historically, there were three problems with long term continuous wear, the biggest being the threat of infection. Think of a contact lens as the inside of a petri dish, a wonderful place to nourish nasty little microorganisms with it's gelatine like culture and constant 98.6 temperature.  The second, and one that affects me big time, is sleeping with a lens in (done it a time or two after a few sips of John Barleycorn)is the blur the next morning either with or without glasses or with or without the contacts caused by edema to the cornea (not everyone reacts this way but I do). Finally, is the cutoff of oxygen to the cornea which the cornea desperately needs to survive. The new lenses are of a material that suppresses infection, allows bountiful oxygen to the cornea, and doesn't cause edema....supposedly.  Some day I'll get my hands on a pair of freebies and give them a trial, but my own feeling at this time is who needs them? Soft lenses and solutions have come such a long way I have no problem at all just removing at night and inserting in the morning.  Or wearing my glasses, of course.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;29 Aug 2002, 07:28</p><p>Ah, Glasgow! Yes, Peter, definitely one of the best places around for gwg-watching. On Sunday lunchtime, for instance, I was enjoying a quiet meal in a bar on Byers Rd when my day was made when in came what I assume were a father and daughter, since both had strong myopic correction and they interacted like a parent with his grown-up child. Lucky Dad is all I can say. His lenses were very thick indeed, but hers were pretty strong too, sticking out noticeably either side of her (quite small) frames and catching the light in a most delightful way, with very obvious power rings. Somewhere in the region of minus 6 to 8 for certain (the dad was quite a bit more than that). She was in her 20s I guess, looking very pretty in jeans and a black hooded top. They were talking about the production of Swan Lake which they had seen in Edinburgh the previous evening, among other things, so quite a cultured pair. Hope I run into them again, especially the girl who was a really lovely gwg.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>aviator</b>&nbsp;16 Jul 2002, 12:19</p><p>Some observations on the differences between the frames currently in vogue for sunglasses and prescription glasses:-  </p><p> </p><p>Over the years the styles for sunglasses have often lead the way for prescription frames, but at present there seems to be a wide divergence. A large proportion of prescription frames are dark plastic, generally with a small window, although the trend is going towards a wider, if not deeper window. The other main style in prescription frames are the rimlsss variety, but again, the lens/window size is generally small. </p><p> </p><p>Sunglasses, on the other hand, are almost entirely very large, mirrored, and  curved around the face. The only common link with the style of  prescription frames is the rimless element.  </p><p> </p><p>It is curious, that so few people seem to be attempting to have prescription glasses made in styles which follow those of the large sunglasses. There are, of course, technical limitations, but even so, the average prescription can be made up using a large lens size, and then mounted in a rimless frame, and tinted to individual taste. In practice, I have seen very few women with this combination, but on the rare occasion I have, the effect is awesome.  </p><p> </p><p>Because the lens is large, a prescription of say 5 produces a considerable edge thickness, which on a rimless frame is always interesting. Viewed front on, the combination of a tint and the distortion of the lens on the face also has great appeal.  </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if we can expect this to be the next style in prescription glasses fashion? I would certainly prefer it to plastic frames which end up hiding too much of the face, and downplay the impact which a good minus lens can make! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Rimless don't work with glass lenses, which I use, but I figure an elegant pair of gold wire frames for me might do the trick.

The good old days were back in the 80's and 90's when large plastic frame glasses were in style.  I have eight different pairs of glasses that I wear at different days.  I have a rimless pair that has large lenses in them and I have a metal framed pair with large lenses and a titanium frame with large lenses.  Other than that, my favorite pair that I always seem to wear most of the time is a small brown plastic frame oval pair by Calvin Klein. </p><p>Take care for now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2002, 10:09</p><p>Rimless is really nice in my opinion.  And Portia is quite right when she says rimmless have been around for years.  I have, as one of my most treasured purchases, a pair of rimmless from the late 30's that are glass myodiscs.  The left eye is about -23D, the right is around -20D. They are a plano front, with a plus rear carrier.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dr.S</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2002, 09:04</p><p>I really like rimless or semi-rimless, especially the traditional styles like the Art-Craft Rimway or Shuron Ronwinne with screw mounting and cable temples. But one thing I am finding is that if you need (or want) lenses that are really thick, few if any opticians will consider putting such lenses into this kind of frame. Does anyone know of an optician, preferably web-based, that is willing to try such a mounting and has the necessary tricks such as cutting steps or ledges into the lens outer edge so the screws can get through?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JT</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2002, 08:06</p><p>Sorry . . . not present tense but in the future when someone bored with the uniform super thin lensed rimless subtlety is willing to sacrifice some comfort and visionability and opts to replace them with thick chunks.  Style is not about comfort whereas uniformity is. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2002, 06:44</p><p>JT - what was that about stipulating pre high index rimless glass chunks? </p><p> </p><p>An interesting element about frame styles -- I feel like there is a bit of tension between comfort &amp; appearance versus function.  What I mean is that the glasses that are really popular right now tend to be quite small and somewhat oblong (oval or rectangular or in between, but not round) -- and this makes glasses lighter and also, I think, better looking.  But it can cause functional problems -- the field of view is smaller.  For me, this usually doesn't matter at all, but a few times I've been annoyed when I was doing desk work and had to bend over too far in order to avoid looking below my lenses (which made things blurry).  I guess someone could have different glasses for different things. </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The guy</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2002, 02:32</p><p>Alan, </p><p>My lenses are high-index and not that big either. i still like the frame I have now better than any of the other options lol otherwise I wouldn't have picked this one ;)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JT</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2002, 23:28</p><p>Yea, funny thing about styles.   Minimal no frame correction is style, too.  Consider this . . . while the white interior stays pure  remember  how often style changes  and  how we crook our necks to indulge.  Sadly, rimless may be back as briefly as anything (goes).   </p><p> </p><p>Then again the  New Order will deflate the stigma of vision problems and well cut to the chase:  correction with classic rimless . . . as non descript as mens underwear. </p><p> </p><p>Then.

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2002, 21:31</p><p>All styles are somewhat likely to become passe, though I think the better rimless styles stand a better chance of lasting a long time than just about anything else.  I think that because they are "elegant" -- there isn't much to the glasses except for the lense and some small pieces of metal.  Things like this tend to retain more popularity than 'louder' things.  For example, in homes' interiors, white is always safe, whereas fancy wallpaper is likely to be out of style in no time, even though the wallpaper seems wonderful when it's first put in.  Rimless glasses are also quite unobtrusive, which reduces just how "bad" they could be, style-wise.  But styles will surely change, and they probably won't be as popular in a few years. </p><p>   The guy - at -6 or -7, there's no reason rimless glasses shouldn't be completely feasible if the lenses are somewhat high-index and not too large of an eyesize. </p><p> </p><p>Alan </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>spexalot</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2002, 12:59</p><p>Plastic frames on people make the person in them seem more lke they really need vision correction (regardless of the Rx). More so than those who choose to wear wire or rimless styles. Maybe this is why plastic or horn rim glasses have that "nerdy" image and those in wire or rimless are viewed as "hipsters". Plastic is more noticeable while worn compared to the others. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2002, 09:58</p><p>In the spring, everyone around here emerges from hibernation and shows off the new styles for the year. So I'm looking forward to next month and should have plenty of glasses sightings. Haven't seen much that is radically new around here yet -- still lots of small geometric plastics in black and laminates. I'm still waiting for frames to creep back into medium sizes. </p><p> </p><p>Come to think of it, isn't a medium sized frame pretty ideal for the average face? Strange how often they are out of fashion (last time was mid-90's with those round wire specs). I'm currently wearing medium sized silver semi-rimless aviators (52 eyesize), so I'm doing my part.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4iiii's</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2002, 19:06</p><p>By "best" I meant from a satety standpoint. Your correct, Polycarb is more expensive and is recomended with anti scratch coating. For most Rx's (-6 to +4) color "shift" shouldn't be a problem. but all Hi- index's except glass have that problem.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2002, 11:40</p><p>4 iii's - There is still more chromatic aberration with polycarbonate than with other lenses, I believe.  They are also more expensive than CR39.  They scratch more easily.  And they are thicker and heavier than a higher index lens for strong prescriptions.  So I don't think it's fair to say they are "the best" lenses.  But for prescriptions that aren't that strong, and for people willing to spend extra money (for the lenses and scratch-resistant coating), they are often the best choice. </p><p> </p><p>As for trademarks - well, this isn't the proper forum to dwell on this, but I don't think having a trademark registered is a legal requirement for protection.  I think it just makes protection easier, since the trademark holder can point to the registration and there is no doubt about their claim; otherwise, the legal process can take a while.  Point: if you're planning on stealing someone's trademark, I'm not sure you're free and clear just because it isn't registered.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4 iii's</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2002, 03:58</p><p>I have one pair of glasses that have hi-index lenses. The lenses seem very fragle when I've had them out of the frame. I could easily break them in half if I wanted to. I am now afraid to wear the glasses. Polycarbonate is the best choise for lenses, its much stronger. Much better than CR-39 too. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fathom</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2002, 00:57</p><p>S4E: Thank you for the info!  I'm curious about why tints don't stick well to hi-index glass.  Have heard of this before but the 'why' is something I've yet to learn.  But while they can't be tinted, I've been told - hopefully correctly - that edge coatings (i.e. painting/coating the lens edges in the primary colour of the frame) can be done for even the highest index glass.  Any ideas why this might be so? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2002, 09:22</p><p>Hey Fathom; I would have to say no, no, and no.  As far as tinting, the tint might come out really light, but I think that they will tint a bit.  It is possible to drill hi index glass, but the chance of breakage is so high that no one will do it.  It is also possible to put the little line around the edge to put the fine nylon line into for rimmless, but again, no one wants to do it.  And for the tint, well again no one wants to do it because it might come out looking splotchy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>boringeyes</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2002, 07:57</p><p>A TM after a sentence only means that they have applied to have it trademark.  If there is no "R", it leaves it open that the registration is not complete.  Let's say I have a band called, "Party Pukers" and I decide I want the slogan to be, "We turn your puke psychedelic."  Let's say that you want to use that slogan too (why, I don't know, because it's pretty bad, even for off-the-cuff).  Well, if I have TM after that, you might still be able to use it.  I might have sent it in five minutes ago.  The only danger you have is that if my registration comes through, and I start using the R, you have wasted all that time marketing a slogan you can't use anymore.  The other danger you have is that the registration has gone through and I just didn't put the R, and now I can sue you.  But there's still the possibility that the registration dudes will tell me I can't trademark that slogan, in which case we can both use it. </p><p> </p><p>That's very oversimplified.  I'm not a trademark lawyer or any lawyer, and there wouldn't be any if it were broken down that easily.  I just thought my meager knowledge might help clarify things for some.  </p><p> </p><p>Laura</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fathom</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2002, 05:35</p><p>A couple of questions for those in the know:  </p><p> </p><p>Can glass lenses (both regular and the really high index, i.e. 1.8 and 1.9) be fitted into a semi-rimless frame?  I've already been told that they can't be drilled into for rimless...is there another way to hold a lense in rimless frames besides drilling? </p><p> </p><p>Is it possible to tint hi-index glass (again, 1.8 and 1.9)? </p><p> </p><p>Any and all help would be much appreciated! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fathom</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2002, 03:58</p><p>I'd have to agree with Alan about Lenscrafters probably not having good enough frames to stand by that wonderful ad.  I'm a frames aficionado and enjoy wider availability, but for them what's on the shelf is what you get - at least at the Lenscrafter outlets around my area.  I was told by the staff that they couldn't order in alternate colours of the frames on display, and that they also couldn't get in other models from manufacturers they represent.  (But not all large optical chains are like this!)   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2002, 02:20</p><p>Possibly off-topic,but on the matter of arcane copyright situations,the well-known tune to'The Twelve Days of Christmas' is non-copyright,with the exception of the four notes which set the words 'Five Gold Rings'.This part of the tune was added in the nineteenth-century,and the publishers regularly renew the copyright,as the addition of these notes entirely alters the character of the tune.Any composer or arranger making a new arrangement or orchestration of the tune we know now must apply to the publishers who first published this tune. But the publishers only receive copyright royalties on the proportion of the tune that is 'Five Gold Rings'. I believe this is estimated at 5%. </p><p>Peter                                     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2002, 00:18</p><p>It's a little known fact that the tune for the ever-popular "Happy Birthday to You" which is sung a million times every day - is still in copyright - but I gather the copyright owners are resigned to the fact that they can't bring the entire world to book over the matter!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eddy</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2002, 16:21</p><p>Believe me Alan, as someone who has tried on several occasions to trademark simple sentences, it'd NEVER stand up in court, even if the registrar would accept the registration in the first place. But, as you say, a great idea.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2002, 15:25</p><p>That Lenscrafter's line is excellent...I mean, it's despicable that they could claim that a perfectly plain and natural sentence can be a trademark...but what a great sentence for the world at large to buy into!  I hope they will...but I don't know that Lenscrafters tend to have good enough frames to make the world feel that way.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fildar</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2002, 19:55</p><p>I know many people on here aren't big fans of the national eyewear chains, but I spotted this wonderful thing in a LensCrafters commercial the other day.. I guess they were touting their lines of expensive designer frames..It went something like.. "Don't you wish you were lucky enough to need glasses?" </p><p> </p><p>How cool is that? :)  And, there was a "TM" (trademark) symbol after the phrase, so that nobody else can rip it off.  They're really trying to combat the laser eye surgery thing now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2001, 12:45</p><p>I love that idea RnR!!  What's an Optiholic gotta do around here ta get this idea rolling?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RnR</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2001, 12:27</p><p>Wouldn't it be cool to see the other eyescene users glasses in a online gallery (like a pic of the glasses and the prescription of the lenses), I think many users have cams / scaners and stuff like that and can make easy a pic of their specs, so we all could discuss about the style and look of different glasses / prescriptions, people could get an idea how a -10 or +7 can look... and we can see what styles work great with different prescriptions in real life... </p><p> </p><p>think about it </p><p> </p><p>cheers </p><p>RnR</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2001, 11:52</p><p>I've noticed a developing trend. The trendiest glasses are taking on the look of a face shield -- the lines of some newer spec styles seem like something you would see a superhero wearing as they leap into action. </p><p> </p><p>It's a sleek look that may not get co-opted by the mass market as quickly as the wraparound did. Anyway, wraparounds are hard to get prescription lenses into.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patthew</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2001, 12:06</p><p>I've seen a few students at my University with Aviator-style frames, and being a huge fan just got a pair myself.  I really like them, they're different than the hum-drum frames that have become so homogenously common.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2001, 17:43</p><p>Hi Alan, </p><p> </p><p>I currently live at Ione Plaza, which is on the PSU campus although it's a private building. </p><p> </p><p>Rimless are around, although they never really caught fire beyond the SE Asian community here. However, among those wearers I see a tremendous variety of sizes, tints and styles. The overall trend among both men and women wearing rimless here might be described as decorative contemporary: basic shapes augmented with crafted decoration. </p><p> </p><p>I grew up in Portland, but have also lived several other places in the US. Native New Yawker.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2001, 17:38</p><p>Wurm, </p><p>   Is the college you're talking about Portland State, Reed, or something else?  Have you lived in Portland for a long time? </p><p>   How common are rimless there?  Do any very-new trends seem to be emerging? </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2001, 07:32</p><p>Currently I see mostly small, narrow shapes, some in wire, some thin plastic and many heavy plastic frames particularly in black. Most of it is basically unisex: rhinestone decorations seem to have largely disappeared, taking the retro-50's look (for both women and men) with them. </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps retro trends in general will fade away and usher in an era of new technology and style innovation. </p><p> </p><p>I'm in Portland, Oregon, USA. I currently live on a downtown college campus, so I see a lot of what the Bauhaus-loving urbanites are wearing. On the other hand, it's Oregon, so I also see the habitually out-of-fashion viewing the world from behind large round metal frames. Which looks fine on some of them. </p><p> </p><p>I've been switching off between a narrow semi-rimless and a comfortable old standby large chunky plastic frame. So I'm certainly not breaking any new ground these days.</p><p></p><hr>
