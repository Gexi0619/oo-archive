<p><b>Adam</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2018, 09:35</p><p>28 Jun 2018 16:20 post was not me. I think trolls should go away from this site. </p><p>Of course, I could deal with the situation, that's a very silly comment.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JC</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2018, 06:17</p><p>Bensmith: </p><p> </p><p>Yes! I work in the airline industry and I like to hang out around the flight information display systems for just that reason. I notice a lot, maybe most, squint at them just because they are concentrating on them -- maybe not because it is hard for them to see.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bensmith</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2018, 02:27</p><p>Adam, </p><p> </p><p>I've been thinking about that. Teachers and professors must witness a whole lot of squinting. When I think about my time at school and at the university, there were squinters in nearly every group. Or at least it was not that uncommon. </p><p> </p><p>It would be strange to have an occupation like that when squinting is such a big turn on for me. I guess the same goes for working in fast-food restaurants where people have to read menus on the walls.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adam</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2018, 16:20</p><p>I forgot to mention that immediately after my presentation, I went off to the nearest bathroom and unloaded.I barely got my pants down before I spuged all over the stall,and even got my shoes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adam</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2018, 11:06</p><p>About 2 years ago at the university, I had an experience with a squinting girl during my presentation. She was squinting hard to read the ppt and it was quite difficult for me to concentrate on the presentation as squinting is a huge turn on for me (as huge as seeing a naked girl). She is never wearing glasses and she also squinted at other one's presentation, too. She was also a bit cross-eyed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Trent</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2018, 20:33</p><p>Nice sighting in the park two young ladies walking both wearing black tights. One with a rather large fanny wore black frames with significant edge thickness. Maybe minus 12.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2018, 02:19</p><p>Interesting times as an increasing number of my wife friends start needing reading glasses. At every new gathering there seems to be an additional woman showing off her new reading glasses, mostly when reading a menu at the restaurant. Or when showing stuff on their smartphones. Most are in their early forties, and whilst 1-2 years ago everybody was still trying hard convincing the others they could still perfectly reading small print, the specs now go around the table, are tried on and compared.  </p><p> </p><p>I must say some have found very sexy frames, in bright colours or with other flashy details. Reading glasses often sit atop their heads, there is clearly no shame anymore in showing them. </p><p> </p><p>Last Saturday, I also eavesdropped on a myopic friend telling another invitee she had recently switched to progressive lenses as reading became too much of a hassle with her previous lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gerry</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2017, 13:42</p><p>HI Specsforever, Its nice there are others like you and me in here, we can tell the ladies truthfully we accept their thick glasses as part of their attractiveness, infact ladies who need to wear their glasses all the time because of poor vision, are much more genuine, have warm caring personalities, and their is real beauty in their eyes behind the glasses. Thanks for your reply have fun Gerry. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Six</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2017, 23:58</p><p>I work 3rd shift at a local gym. Tonight, I had an interesting nearsighting. I saw a girl walking towards the front desk, squinting hard as she was trying to clean her glasses with a paper towel. I could tell that she was not having much luck since dry paper towels are not the best thing to try and clean glasses with. I happened to have one of those moist towelettes that are made to clean glasses with me.  </p><p>I told her that I had a glasses cleaning wipe with me and asked her if she would like one. I reached into my pocket, got the moist towelette out and offered it to her. At the same moment the girl held out her glasses towards me. She asked me if I could clean them for her because she could not see clearly to do so.  </p><p>Of course, I could not pass up the opportunity like this! The frames were the popular plastic framed glasses. The myopic lenses were thick and had several power rings inside. More power rings in the left than in the right lens. I took out my cleaning cloth and began to clean her thick minus lenses for her. There was a deep curve and the sides were noticeably sticking out of the frames.  </p><p>I cleaned them more thouroughly than needed and I chatted up her and her boyfriend while I was cleaning them. If her boyfriend was not there, I may have worked up the courage to ask her to exchange glasses. I even cleaned her frames for her. I held them up to the light. They were perfectly clean, but I pretended that they needed additional cleaning anyways. She was squinting hard at me, even though I was not even three feet away. I finally offered them back to her.  </p><p>Now this was the first time that I had seen the glasses on her face. The thick myopic lenses made her eyes look smaller, yet brighter and clearer. She was no longer squinting but had a focused stare. I could not help to to stare at her thick, clean myopic glasses, knowing that I was the one who had just cleaned them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gerry</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2017, 05:08</p><p>Hi specs forever, I can get into posting an email my al does not work something to do with the company i am with. It was really nice to see your reply sometimes like you i thought i was an odd ball I do not think its an obsession  with glasses,I think its more about seeing the whole person and not the glasses. I do love and i find i,m attracted to ladies wearing glasses, with designer frames and hi index lenses they can be a fashion statement. </p><p>If you would like to be in touch your welcome. arnoldmartinjock@hotmail.com</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2017, 07:26</p><p>Hi gerry.  It has been a long time since I posted my e mail address on here, but over the 20 years I have been reading the postings in this group I have made a few friends here. At first, like probably everyone else here who has an obsession towards glasses, I thought I was the only one, but eyescene has helped me realize that there are a lot more of us out there than we think.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gerry</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2017, 12:30</p><p>I left my email address in here a lovely lady contacted me.she has really strong glasses which i love she herself is beautiful. Sadly she is only 17 years old, i,m almost double her age. I,m sure we can become good friends, but i would consider it inappropriate to date such a lovely beautiful young lady i adore her in glasses. Atlas i have found a lovely friend. Have you fond a friend in this site.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NNVisitor</b>&nbsp;07 Sep 2017, 14:55</p><p>I went to a place I frequent for lunch today. The have a huge blackboard with chalk written menu items. A lot of the writing is in small letters. My corrected vision is 20/25 or better so I know what a reasonable distance is to see the menu items on the board with proper correction. While at my table a couple both wearing glasses comes in. The woman walks much closer to read the menu items. Later two pairs of women walk in. The first pair walk really close to the menu to read it. The second couple seem to have no problem reading it from a distance. One of them suddenly goes closer to see something on the menu. </p><p>The woman from the first couple had a low myopia prescription. She needs stronger glasses now. The couple that went really close did not wear glasses but must be nearsighted in need of correction. </p><p>Judging from their distances to read the menu I'd say the three of them probably see anywhere from 20/50 to perhaps 20/80.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bensmith</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2017, 21:55</p><p>At the airport grocery store, two beautiful Russian 20-year-old girls had probably left their contacts and glasses in their bags, as I noticed they were both both squinting at the products. They would slowly lean closer to the shelves - closer than people normally would - with a squinty look and pick up products to examine them closer to their eyes. So hot. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>2hard2see</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2017, 10:07</p><p>I loive nearsighted girls more than anything.  i remember watching a tv when i was a kid with this girl who needed very strong thickies, but bullies uses to take her thickies.  she was so hot hwen she was blurred.  i watched shows in secret to masturbate from it.  i love the erotic look of girls eyes when she needs thickies and cant see good.  if her eyes baddest they are even more attractive. omg i love movies where thickies get crushed and girl is vulnerabel and trapped in blur. i love seeing her distoriented, dazec, condfused from no more thickies. please oh please oh pleasue of please girls do not wear thickies, crush them!!!!!!!  i always think of these girls when they masturbate how cummy it must be for them to live with no thickies and blur. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jake</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2017, 17:36</p><p>Is there any "natural" way to become nearsighted? (Like reading with little light, etc.) I've heard of numerous ways but Im not sure which ways work, if any. Thanks!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2017, 11:04</p><p>Janelle </p><p>So you were first prescribed glasses / contacts about 2 years ago when you were 17 years old. At that time you only needed correction for astigmatisms. Now 4 months ago one eye required a -.50 correction for SPH (distance) Was there any change in your astigmatism correction at this time from 2 years before? Generally speaking astigmatisms don't usually change much if any over time. But in the last 4 months you are noticing some problems with seeing distances even with your glasses or contacts on and you're concerned. It would seem that it is the myopia that needs to be increased. It's likely that you were just under prescribed at the time you had your eyes examined. Since it is not much past 90 days which many doctors and optical stores will usually offer to re examine your eyes and even change the lenses in your glasses and replace your contacts with new ones you should not waste anymore time and call where you had your eyes examined at and got your glasses and contacts from. Just tell them that you have been noticing this problem nearly from the time you got your new glasses and contacts. Thye should at the very least do a re exam at a very reduced rate or at no charge to you.  </p><p>Because your already 19 and only have a weak prescription now I wouldn't expect that your eyes are likely to change all that much over the next few years. And actually your already very close to the time when your eyes could be starting to become stable. I really don't think your eyesight will ever become very bad. I base this on the fact that you apparently didn't have much change in the 2 years between eye exams. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adam</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2017, 09:20</p><p>Last year I spent a day in Karlovy Vary when I saw a Chinese girl with strong minus glasses, about -8. Once she gave her phone to his girlfriend to take a photo and also took off her glasses for the photo. She wasn't squinting, maybe just a bit, but I saw in her eyes that she can't see anything. Her look was like 'seeing to nowhere'.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Janelle</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2017, 14:35</p><p>Hello, </p><p> </p><p>I have had glasses for 2 years, and also contacts. Prior to four months ago, I had correction for astigmatism only. I now have a small (-.5) myopia correction in one eye. However, I am lately noticing difficulty seeing in the distance again, even with correction. I'm a little concerned that I'm having trouble seeing already. It makes me worry about how much my myopia could progress in the long run. I'm a 19 year old female so I think I'm likely to experience more vision changes? Any thoughts? </p><p> </p><p>Janelle</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2016, 20:33</p><p>A.P.E.  </p><p> </p><p>Sounds similar to this movie about an optician in the wild west who becomes a reluctant hero and prescribes Wyatt Earp eyeglasses <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104293/" target="_blank">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104293/</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2016, 08:28</p><p>Two wonderful sightings in the past weeks. </p><p> </p><p>One at the airport: young lady around 30, long brown air, brown eyes, good body, squinting here and there while walking to the gate. Wanted to see something in a shop window and got there squinting then getting really close. I followed her as much as I could and a certain time while looking around searching for the rest room (which she finally located) we crosses our eyes and she gave a deep and prologuend quint at me. She was clearly unable to see my face even I was really close to her. Must have been not less tha, say, -4. Unfortunately I was with a colleague of mine so I could not have the opportunity to chat with her and ask her prescription. </p><p> </p><p>Second sighting in a holiday village on the seaside. Very cute tall brunette around 18th always wearing a pair of very strong glasses (more than -10 for sure). No evidence of contacts or even prescription sunglasses during the holidays. She only removed glasses when sunbathing or swimming. Astonishingly she was able to do even alone and bareeyed. I'm wonderng how she could see her steps.... very very attrative.</p><p></p><hr>

In that case it is completely normal that eyes go "bad" without any particular reason at all. It happens to a lot of people and probably had nothing to do with you wearing other peoples glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2012, 09:59</p><p>Blurry in Boston </p><p>In regards to any questions being asked about the glasses your wearing and that they may not be the correct prescription for your eyes. Simply take off your glasses right before you enter the optical shop and tell them that your glasses were lost and that is why your there because you need to replace them. I'm sure you have a Lenscrafters in the Boston area so and the the doctors are separate from the where you purchase your glasses from. So when the exam is over simply pay for your exam and ask for a copy of your prescription and if they ask about glasses say you have someone you get your glasses from. No questions will be asked. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2012, 06:32</p><p>"I have this fear that they will ask me how my eyes got so bad and why am I not wearing glasses now, and I don't want to tell them that I have been wearing strong glasses for my pleasures.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2012, 19:37</p><p>Blurry in Boston, </p><p>An eye exam is one of the easiest and most painless medical exams there is.  An eye exam is not like an exam in school where you have to answer questions or justify your answers.  The only questions the examiner will ask are about how you see without correction and how well you see lines of letters on a chart with various trial lenses.  You should not wear glasses that were not prescribed for you to an exam. </p><p>An eye exam consists of 3 parts. </p><p>1. Visual history and general health - some health problems can affect your vision.  You don't have to tell them about trying glasses from the thrift store.  Just tell them some things across the room are a bit blurry. </p><p>2. Objective Exam - This is where they look into your eyes to see if there are any obvious problems and get an idea of your approximate prescription.  Sometimes, part of this exam is done by asking you to look into a machine called an auto-refractor.  You will probably see some kind of picture and the in a few seconds, the machine will print out your approximate Rx. </p><p>3. Subjective Exam - If the Objective part of the exam indicates that some vision correction is needed, you will be asked to look through a machine called a Phropter that has a lot of different lenses that can be easily selected and you will be asked to tell the examiner what lens is clearer or in some cases which lens is fuzzier.  The examiner has no way to tell what you see, only what you tell him/her you see.  However, you should not try to cheat.  You want the most accurate Rx you can get. </p><p>After you find out your actual Rx and if you decide you would like a different Rx, we can tell you how to do it safely. </p><p>Based on your comments about the clarity of the poster, I suspect you may be a bit nearsighted. </p><p>Here is a quick test.  Hold a book or newspaper at normal reading distance.  Gradually move it away  and note where the normal sized text gets unreadable.  Measure that distance.  Do this a couple of times and let us know the distance.  Ideally, you should do the test from close to farther away and also from too far away to read until it just becomes readable.  Also try to notice if the straight lines that make up letters like E, W, K, &amp; H are equally clear when the letters become readable. </p><p>Many people who are nearsighted like wearing glasses that a bit stronger (more minus correction) than they need because that often makes their vision sharper and more vivid.  People who need plus glasses sometimes think that more plus in their glasses will help them see better, but in general, plus glasses help you see close things better and sometimes too much plus makes distant things blurry. </p><p>There is nothing wrong with wanting to see well. </p><p>May I ask your age? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2012, 18:51</p><p>Blurry in Boston </p><p>Well if you have created an actual need for glasses and it is as bad as you claim you won't be able to hide it for much longer. I assume your either not of driving age or you don't drive? Doesn't sound like you will be able to pass the vision test for driving. Also many jobs require good vision as well.  </p><p>Do you live with your parents? If so I don't know how you have not been caught by now?  </p><p>Like Cactus Jack recommended you probably should make an appointment to get your eyes checked so you at least have some idea what your true vision is, then if you still feel the urge to wear different and stronger glasses you can order some online that are just slightly stronger every so often. But I think just buying glasses at thrift stores is really a pretty bad idea. That's kinda like taking pills from other peoples medicine cabinet. You have no idea what harm they may be doing. Wearing stronger glasses is one thing but the way your doing it is very dangerous in my opinion.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Blurry in Boston</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2012, 16:50</p><p>Thank you for the help guys.  I have no idea what my prescription would be because I avoid getting my eyes checked at all costs!  I have this fear that they will ask me how my eyes got so bad and why am I not wearing glasses now, and I don't want to tell them that I have been wearing strong glasses for my pleasures.  But I wonder if they can tell the difference between someone who made their eyes bad over someone who just needs glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I know that my eyesight is getting worse.  I have a Justin Bieber poster on the wall in my room and if I stand behind my bed, I would not be able to figure out who he is without getting closer.  I remember a time when I used to be able to see that poster clearly. </p><p> </p><p>If my parents find out about me needing glasses, they will ask how is it I need them too, and it's bad enough I almost got caught a couple times, so I can't tell them I get a sincere sexy pleasure out of it.  I would be *so* embarrassed to say that! </p><p> </p><p>But nobody has answered why I get such a rush out of stronger and stronger glasses.  Am I developing a tolerance like some of my friends have with beer?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2012, 20:29</p><p>Blurry in Boston, </p><p>I may have missed it, but I don't think anything was said about an eye exam or a real Rx.  If we had a starting point, even if it is an Rx of 0.00 in both eyes, we could offer suggestions for enjoying almost any desired visual experience using high quality, low cost glasses from online retailers.  It would be a much better approach than randomly trying glasses with unknown sphere and cylinder powers. </p><p>We can even tell you how to do some simple preliminary tests to get an idea of your actual visual acuity and what to say when you go for an Eye Exam. Also, it is important to know your age because that helps us understand your uncorrected vision better.  If you have been reading some of these posts, you are probably aware that at some point, presbyopia will begin to play a role in any suggestions we make, no matter what other factors are involved. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2012, 20:02</p><p>Blurry in Boston </p><p>First off I for one don't think your insane. I have friends that are in their early 20's and they are a little like you in that they tell me they have found the blur they get when they take off their glasses is very much like being high or drunk only better because it is not against the law and they can quickly correct the feeling by putting their glasses back on. That kinda sounds like what your enjoying. The main down side to what your doing is that as your finding it is getting harder to find glasses that are strong enough and yet nor so strong that you can't function wearing them. Also since many glasses have astigmatism correction in them and it can be hard to determine that when your just trying them on at a thrift store. Astigmatism may make some of your selections very uncomfortable to wear for any period without getting a massive headache. My suggestion is to go into any optical store in your area wearing your latest glasses and ask the optician to read the prescription off the lenses for you. If they ask why, just tell them that people have been asking you what your prescription is and you didn't know. Having that number to go by then after you get bored with your glasses and want something else you can go on line and just order glasses that are a little stronger than the ones your wearing and don't use anything but the SPH numbers. What is you age as that is a factor to how much your eyes will change from wearing all these glasses? Are you at a point now where your vision has changed and stays blurry all the time? </p><p></p><hr>

I normally buy glasses second hand but that is scary because I always fear I will get caught by someone who knows me.

I once told one of my girlfriends and she laughed so hard and I was so embarrassed that I never told anyone else again!! </p><p> </p><p>I don't want to use my real name here because I am afraid someone will find out who I am.

Not only do we screen the athletes, but we make glasses for them on-site.Of course some prescriptions are extreme, so we have to order lenses for those folks. For the folks with more normal prescriptions we make the glasses for them right there (as many as 90 in a single day). A lot of work, but very rewarding.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>EyeTri</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2012, 16:15</p><p>Thanks for that wonderful information.  I've often thought about whether or not to volunteer to pick up glasses, distribute glasses, and whatnot but with such strong sexual feelings that I have attached to this fetish, does that make me ineligible and inappropriate?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2012, 08:28</p><p>Soundman is correct, there are many others, but as mentioned this one goes a step further because of the sustainability aspect; still and all, their primary mission is to restore sight to those previously thought to be blind by the simple means of a pair of glasses.  I know of one OD who told of a young man in a school for the blind, but when fitted with a pair of -13 diopter glasses was restored to a normal life. </p><p> </p><p>The Lion's Club is a wonderful charity and very necessary, and I also am aware of the mechanics of their organization. Their own volunteers, and volunteer opticians, screen, neutralize, and catalog the donated eyeglasses for donation.  But it is OGS and the others that dispense them after examination, all of the OD missions use Lion's Club glasses.   </p><p> </p><p>Another very good one is Volunteer Optometric Service to Humanity (VOSH)which OGS often supports financially.  And, OGS because of its close ties to the global optical community also provide brand new glasses by buying frames and lenses in bulk. </p><p>So, they do need a large cash flow.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2012, 10:47</p><p>Revolver is correct there are several groups that are very good including "Gift of Sight" and "The Lion's Club International" Money of course is more than welcome and can be used in so many good ways but if your not in a position to donate money but you have a drawer full of old glasses that are of no use to you, donate them at your eye care professional's office. Almost all of them have some type of box for that purpose.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2012, 10:37</p><p>Eye Tri (and all of us):  one of the best, if not the very best, is Optometry Giving Sight.  It is a truly global group, sanctioned by the World Health Organization, and sets itself aside by providing sustainable eye care.  That is to say, when a mission group provides exams, diagnosis (including drugs where applicable and surgery where applicable) and eyeglasses, they also provide teaching to people in the country to make sure that the work they've done continues when they leave. it was founded by, and still run by, Doctors of Optometry with the help of all ECP volunteers and support staff.  They also help to fund, when they can, other organizations that provide eyeglasses to the needy. I've long been a supporter, seen them in action, and think they're tops.  You can learn all about them at www.givingsight.org </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>EyeTri</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2012, 17:55</p><p>Just curious, Sound...  Let's say I wanted to help out those in need of glasses with a donation.  Better yet, let's say if everyone here - all the active Eyescene members - contributed just $5 (or USD equivalent) toward helping all those poverty stricken individuals.  How far would that go to helping them get the glasses they sorely need?  How could we do that? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2012, 18:53</p><p>Eye-Tri </p><p> </p><p>I think that is probably a true statement. Due to poverity in many parts of the world I am sure there are millions that need correction but no means of getting the help they need. Not long ago I saw where they said that here in the US that more than 65% (not sure of the actual percent) of the population wear glasses or contacts and of course there are certainly many that have not been found out that need correction yet. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>EyeTri</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2012, 17:46</p><p>@ Soundman Someone once told me that if you look globally, there are more people in the world who need glasses than people who currently wear glasses.  What do you think of that statement?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2012, 19:02</p><p>Eye-Try </p><p>Interesting question, and one that is really not possible to answer. If someone goes through their life somehow without decent vision they can't be counted as we would not know about them. I do get your point and I can tell you you find many that may have glasses that they received some 10 or more years before so as you can guess the rx is no where near what they need. One big change happened about 12 years ago when the FDA (Federal Drug Admissistration) finally allowed the collected glasses be used in this country. For the years prior the glasses we collected could only be used in other countries. It didn't matter that doctors were giving the exams and even picking out glasses that were very close to what someone needed. They wanted everything to be a prescribed prescription only. This has helped make things at least a little better now. But now due to so many people that were let go from their jobs starting around 2008. The side effect was not only a household loosing that income but also now not having health insurance any longer. Now dental checkups and vision was left go. It soon became something that a family could not afford, most dental work is very costly and the same goes for glasses. I hope that with the job market improving this will allow people to take care of their eyes.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>EyeTri</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2012, 18:30</p><p>@Sound  Can you shed some light on the real state of vision in this country?  How often do you encounter someone going through life without badly needed glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Mar 2012, 16:31</p><p>Eye-Try </p><p>That is a tough question, but since glasses would last much longer than a meal I would have to say glasses would be the correct answer, but if your talking about going without food for a prolonged time that makes the decision much more complex. Sadly I know that there are decisions being made every day just like the question you asked.  </p><p>It really saddens me when I see how much money is spent on politians trying to get elected into an office. That money could do so much good helping people. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>EyeTri</b>&nbsp;22 Mar 2012, 15:14</p><p>I guess that I can see where eliminating blurry vision becomes a secondary goal, but wouldn't that just make life harder?  The eyestrain, headaches, and inability to see could cause more frustration than simply giving in and getting the glasses up front. </p><p> </p><p>It raises an interesting question though.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2012, 19:11</p><p>Eye-Tri </p><p> </p><p>Sadly there are many that are forced to make the same decisions as she had to make. If not for a child maybe to pay a bill to keep electric or heat in the house or even the house itself. Her case I have seen many times. I have been with a volunteer vision group for about 40 years and I am in the US a country that should have plenty and yet it happens here as well. The only thing I could suggest to you to maybe help her is by seeing if she can get a copy of her last exam and order them on-line as that would be the cheapest way. </p><p>I am a bit surprised that the person she was with. That her insurance didn't cover everyone in the car.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>EyeTri</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2012, 15:18</p><p>I have been chatting with this wonderful young Latina online whom I noticed getting very close to the screen each time I typed.  I asked her if she needs glasses and she told me that she used to wear glasses,but got into a car accident and they were broken beyond repair.  Since it was her friend driving, and she did not have insurance, she has had to go without glasses for awhile now.  Because she also has a child, her biggest priority has been feeding the child and glasses come later. </p><p> </p><p>So it has been several months now that she has been living in a blur without glasses, and it makes me wonder how many other impoverished people go through this sort of thing.  They forsake glasses, even if their eyes are very bad, just to ensure there is food on the table for a family. </p><p> </p><p>I always thought perfect eyesight was the most important thing, but apparently it is not to some people.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jack</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2012, 20:54</p><p>I was just reading Strip Club Fan's posts about that nearsighted stripper without glasses and something occurred to me. Even if she had glasses, would she really wear them out on stage? She's a stripper, so her job is to look attractive to men. The majority of men would prefer to see her without glasses, so wouldn't she take them off for work anyway?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2011, 14:34</p><p>I had a sighting of what I would call a perfectly bespectacled lady in London on a recent guided house tour. She looked southern european, about 25 with a dark complexion but when she asked the guide questions spoke with an american accent.Her clothes were nicely understated but what made her special were her eyeglasses which were small oval rimless with the outer sides cut off slightly and delicate gold curved side arms without hinges or they were well concealed. The lenses I judged about -6 to -8 probably high index and made by a craftsman with exquisitely polished edges. The fronts were perfectly flat[at what minus rx do lens fronts become flat or is it to correct some other eye defect?]and sparkled prettily as there was no anti glare coating.The lenses thickened nicely at the edge and as she looked sideways there were lots of flashing of power rings and lens fronts.As the tour lasted nearly an hour I was able to see her at all angles. Despite her rx looking at her face straight on her beautifully made up eyes could be clearly seen through her small lenses with a nice bit of cut in at the outer sides.Her spectacles were a perect fit and a credit to her optician,however she gently adjusted them from time to time.She was a nice looking young lady but those glasses made her very special.There is no substitute in my book for rimless eyewear to show off lenses to their best advantage. Her choice of frames was a way of turning a necessity into a very individual look.They were like wearing expensive diamonds the way they sparkled.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2011, 09:40</p><p>Indigo: </p><p>for sure that father is not one of those forcing his children to wear glasses. From what you describe about the two teens they most probably have glasses (e.g. for school) but prefer not to wear them full time. It is possible that you can survive with -3 or even more although everything around you is a blur: at the end it's still your choice and most young girls do that (there was a girl reporting of being bereeyed despite a strong myopia in another thread, wasn't there?). On the other hand the youngest may be at a higher level (say -4 or more) or just not so reluctant to wear and preferring a sharp vision instead of a better look. </p><p> </p><p>Strip Club Fan: </p><p>any news about the shortsighted girl in the club? Please report if she is still working there and if she moved to glasses. I can understand that her boss prefer her bareyed (it's typical when your look is part of your job), but why don't she move to contacts?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Indigo</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2011, 12:18</p><p>Had an excellent nearsighting last night.  I went to a restaurant, and as I was ordering, I noticed the table nearby.  It seems there were two young ladies, probably in their late teens, an older man, and a younger girl around 8-10 years old. </p><p> </p><p>The younger girl was sitting there wearing a rather strong pair of glasses.  But what made this interesting, is that the two teenagers were both squinting when reading their menus and looking at the television sets around the room.  Occasionally they would make comments, like can you see this or that, and most of the time each other would reply that it was too blurry. </p><p> </p><p>The older man didn't seem to pay too much attention to their visual problems.  But I found this rather odd.  Is the younger girl allowed to get glasses in the family, and the older girls are not?  Their eyes were obviously quite bad, holding the menus just a few inches from their eyes, yet they lived in blurs all around them.  I figured perhaps the parent got the younger girl glasses for school, but thinking about it, the two older girls must be failing everything in school with eyes that bad. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KC</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2011, 01:32</p><p>The worst is still yet to come for most people.  I wonder how many will be left wandering without glasses when Hurricane Irene is all over Monday morning.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;27 Aug 2011, 09:31</p><p>That's "Irene," not "Eileen."  My husband has some relatives who lived in "Hurricane Hole NC" as he calls it, and those who wear glasses did not lost any, nor did they know of anyone who has.  (They've moved to another area with not the greatest climate either.)  I'm glad they survived the hurricanes, in more ways than one. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specsever</b>&nbsp;27 Aug 2011, 05:26</p><p>I remember seeing ictures of some of the people after Hurrican Katrina in New Orleans.  One girl was wearing a nice pair of decently strong looking glasses, and she commented that she had lost her contacts.  I am thinking that anyone who wore strong glasses would make sure they they were with them at all times. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;26 Aug 2011, 18:13</p><p>Funny you mention that, it reminded me of a SF/disaster book I once read, there was a meteor strike and a minor character was the only one who didn't carry a gun in the ensuing mayhem - his glasses had been smashed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The Morning After Eileen</b>&nbsp;26 Aug 2011, 16:17</p><p>Hurricane/disaster aftermath:  I've often wondered how many people lose their strong glasses during events like this and have to go days or weeks in a blur.  Does anyone know if there is some records of just what happens to all the people lost in their blurry worlds?  Does the Red Cross offer glasses or what?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Strip Club Fan</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2011, 16:26</p><p>So I went back to the strip club and waited to see Mathilde.  Sure enough she came out but still not wearing glasses.  For a moment I thought she was wearing contacts or something because she didn't squint that much, but then I noticed some pretty hard squinting when there was money on the ground further away.  Strange, shouldn't she be wearing glasses? </p><p> </p><p>So I paid for a dance with Mathilde again, and asked her what happened to her getting glasses.  She said she did get glasses, but at this club they don't like glasses on stage, so she has to keep them off.  But I asked her about the squinting and why she didn't seem to squint as much.  She said she knows the layout better now and has been told that it doesn't look attractive when she squints, but sometimes she said she just cannot see good enough.  Isn't that very hard on her I asked, and she said at times it is very hard, so she is not sure if she will stay with this club or not because everything is so blurry in the dim lights. </p><p> </p><p>The dance was incredible and she wore my glasses again during that time.  Again she told me she could see so much better out of my glasses, but I don't seem to recall asking whether she meant compared to her blurry world or her new glasses.  She does have the most amazing eyes too, so in a way, I prefer to see her nearsighted like this.  I am getting a bit off on the semi-helpless thing watching her struggle. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2011, 09:10</p><p>Astra </p><p>From what "Strip Club Fan" said she broke her only pair of glasses and was working without any glasses at all. When he noticed her squinting and asked her she she had placed an order for new ones but they were at the time almost 2 weeks out. She didn't say what the rx was on the ones she broke only that her rx had gone u to -5.75 now. She asked "SCF" if she try his glasses which were -7.50 and of course found she could she much better than with nothing and asked if she could wear them during his dance. I'm sure it would have been quite a turn on if only he could have seen it?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2011, 02:11</p><p>soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>it could be the old glasses she did keep are much lower than required. resulting more than -2 undercorrection.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Highmyope</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2011, 01:52</p><p>Not to brag (ha), but I actually had two myodisc sightings at the exact same spot in the exact same store (at a bench near the checkout lanes). One wearer was on old woman, and the second was a middle-aged man. (Not hot young co-eds, unfortunately. Still.) Of course I wondered if they were sitting there rather than walking around shopping due to visual limitations....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2011, 15:30</p><p>Strip Club Fan </p><p>What is more scary is i wonder how she is getting to and from work? I sure hope she is not driving. Her eyes may accommodate a little but she will still see mostly blur. You know you could be a hero to her if you happen to have any of your old glasses lying around the house. In her situation i am sure she could care less that they are mens are even how they look as long as she can see better. </p><p>I'm a bit surprised that she didn't go somewhere that could make her up some glasses in an hour or at least by the next day. I wonder if she ordered them on-line as that is about the time frame needed for most of them?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Strip Club fan</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2011, 14:13</p><p>At a strip club yesterday and the new girl Mathilde with very pretty eyes kept squinting alot on stage.  As hot as she was, I asked for a lap dance with her.  I asked her about the squinting and she was hoping nobody noticed.  She said she broke he glasses a couple days ago, and is waiting for new ones to come in.  In the meantime she said, "lots of stuff is all blurry to me."  I asked her what her prescription was, and she said it had gone way up since the last time, and it was -5.75 now.  I told her she must be pretty lost without her glasses, it has to be all blur.  She said it really is, and it is much harder working than outside because the lights are so low it makes everything much blurrier, but still needed to work.  I asked her when her glasses are due, and she said next Thursday.  Wow, and she said she was going to work several days up till then.  She asked to try on my glasses, and I told her they were -7.5s, but she still said it was much better with them on.  She wanted to continue the dance wearing them, so I agreed because it was incredible and blew my mind. </p><p> </p><p>This absolutely amazed me.  I can't believe people having to function so long without such a strong prescription to see better.  She looked pretty wasted in the eyes, and I guess that will only get worse until next Thursday.  I would really like to see how she looks just before she finally gets glasses.</p><p></p><hr>







<p><b>ksnl</b>&nbsp;06 May 2011, 04:58</p><p>It's quite rare to see young people wearing glasses where I live, they all opt for contacts or walk around bare-eyed. I am fortunate that where I work I get to see some glasses wearing. My boss wears quite strong glasses and both her sons are full time glasses wearers too (I work from her home office). I see more of her oldest son than her... he does most of the ordering around.  </p><p>Today it was raining outside and he walked in with rain all over his glasses, so he took them off to clean them (SO HOT). While they were off he asked me if there were any paper clips on the other side of me in the container and he had no squint at all, the way he looked with his glasses on, he looked with them off (no crows feet there). I have no clue what his RX is but he's a full time wearer and that's the first time I have seen him with them off and he didn't even squint in the slightest!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;04 May 2011, 11:36</p><p>Actually, I find squinting-induced crow's feet can be cute/sexy. On a younger person I can find them attractive, I think for the very reason that they do indicate squinting. Everybody gets them as they get older though, so then it's not a big thing (and I have to say I'm generally not attracted to ppl past a certain age, sorry, although we do have a local TV news announcer here who must be pushing 50, gray hair and crow's feet (never seen him in glasses though), but I think he's cute). </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>very progressive</b>&nbsp;03 May 2011, 13:45</p><p> </p><p>To all that find squinting to be cute or sexy. Be advised the "crow's feet" that develops is hardly either !!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;01 May 2011, 16:35</p><p>I hope to have a real-life myodisc sighting someday, but most of the time it seems like I'm the most nearsighted person in the room wherever I am. Which is nice, but still... </p><p>On a (mostly) unrelated note, you know how ppl here have talked before about how myopes tend to have "shiny eyelids"? I've noticed it too and tried to think of an explanation. So far what I've come up with is that since myopia can be caused by an abnormally long eyeball, which may have been able to stretch to this size because of a structural weakness of the tissues of the eye, maybe myopes tend to have somewhat "weak", unusually stretchy skin tissue as well, and the growth of the eyeball stretching backwards and forwards has stretched the eyelid skin. So basically those "shiny eyelids" are like stretch marks. Does this make sense to anyone?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2011, 10:56</p><p>I've only ever seen them twice myself, both one-off fleeting glimpses. Perhaps I should camp outside an opticians if I want more sightings.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jim H</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2011, 14:04</p><p>After working at the same place for a while with no gwgs, things have turned around. </p><p> </p><p>One of our managers is 7 months pregnant and has started wearing here glasses all the time.  She is 31 and attractive with shoulder length dark hair and has dark tortoise shell rectangular frames with at least -10.  Flat fronts and great cut it!  I got to sit across from here today in a meeting, can't remember what it was about. </p><p> </p><p>New receptionist is 24 and tiny with long brown hair and came in last week wearing weak minus black metal square rims which look nice on her.  She seems to have gone full time right away. </p><p> </p><p>And finally someone I work close with, she is very pretty, petite with long dark hair and a nice figure.  She has been wearing here half rim black metal frames with wide sides more often because she says she can't see without them.  I knew one eye was stronger than the other but wasn't exactly sure.  Our prescriptions came up because she wants to get lasik, she is R +4.00 and L + 0.75    </p><p>She is very sexy in her glasses and I wish both eyes were that strong because she said she doesn't mind wearing glasses, she just doesn't like the difference in her lenses.  Unfortunately, she had a consultation and is getting lasik on the one eye. </p><p> </p><p>As for my wife, she is still wearing on and off even though she has headaches almost every day from eye strain and is realizing she needs them.  This weekend we went to a spa for a massage and outdoor hot baths.  After the message, which she thought would help her eyes and didn't, she wore here glasses in the shallow pool and hot baths.  She looked very hot in her bathing suit and glasses!  And so did the other lady in the pool in her mid 30's with her -7 purple half rims.  It was a tough time to also be in a bathing suit!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2011, 19:53</p><p>All4Eyes </p><p> </p><p>I have the same issue with the computer.  I have to get so close that it's easier to just put on the glasses.  I think squinting is absolutely adorable, and it turns me on when I need to do so.  Unfortunately, it does get uncomfortable after a while. </p><p> </p><p>I was amazed that squinting could make such a difference on a Snellen chart.  I definitely must try that.

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2011, 16:34</p><p>Chino: I'm -4 and find it similar, I can go around my home bare-eyed fine, outside is a bit unnerving, especially at night, but still doable. Using the computer bare-eyed is quite an effort though, have to lean in close and squint like crazy, which soon has my eyes stinging and hurting and watering. Squinting does still make a BIG difference for me though, subjectively it doesn't seem to anymore except at quite short distances (like the PC screen), but I've measured with a Snellen chart and found I can go from not being able to read the 20/400 line to being able to read the 20/100 line just by squinting. What i love most about going bare-eyed is how great it feels to finally put your glasses back on and how everything seems so clear, for a couple minutes it's almost as good as when you get new glasses. BTW, I'm in Florida too, wouldn't it be funny if we ever ran into each other? </p><p></p><hr>

There were two women attending the meeting both had to be -10 or more. One wore semi rimless frames that were large so the lenses were thick. The other had smaller frames that did not have as much thickness, but produced more cut-in, her glasses were badly in need of adjustment as they kept slipping so she would have to push them up. I had to really watch my self not to stare at her too much during the meeting as she constantly adjusted her glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2011, 21:28</p><p>Had a fantastic sighting while donating plasma today at DCI Biologicals in Tampa, FL. </p><p> </p><p>I was reading the TBT and noticed something strange in my peripheral vision.  I looked up and noticed a middle-aged woman who was practically holding up the TBT to her nose.  Her glasses, in thick clear plastic frames, were perched on top of her head. </p><p> </p><p>I was confused at first because I couldn't tell what type of glasses they were (bad angle).  I initially thought they were plus lenses, but there's no way she'd be able to read from so close if she were that farsighted or presbyopic. </p><p> </p><p>My confusion was cleared up once they called her and she slipped her glasses on to walk towards one of the rooms (less than 5 feet away).  She is very myopic.  I think she was the most myopic woman I had ever encountered in real life.  Based on how close she held the TBT to her eyes (about 3 inches), I'd say her RX was somewhere between -16 to -18. </p><p> </p><p>I was in heaven the whole time because they wound up placing me next to her while we were donating.  She kept it up the entire time, holding the newspaper about 2 inches from her nose while leaving her glasses on her head.  I could have gazed at her the entire time and she would have never known.  Unfortunately, everyone else would have. </p><p> </p><p>I'm looking forward to seeing her again on Fridays.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2011, 21:17</p><p>jen, </p><p> </p><p>As Soundmanpt said, there's no fixed number.  It really is up to the individual. </p><p> </p><p>I'm -5.5 in both eyes.  I'm actually quite comfortable going bare-eyed.  I can recognize buildings and spot vehicles, particularly during the day.  It's much more difficult at night, but I still manage to do my daily walk at night while bare-eyed.  At night, anything beyond 40 feet or so is an unrecognizable gray blur. </p><p> </p><p>Getting around bare-eyed is pretty easy for me, especially if I'm in a familiar environment.  I walk around my university bare-eyed all the time.  Recognizing people is a different story.  However, my university has 35,000 students, so actually crossing paths with someone I know is unlikely. </p><p> </p><p>To read while bare-eyed, I need to bring things withing 9 1/2 inches of my eyes. </p><p> </p><p>As far as things I can't do while bare-eyed, driving is obviously one of them.  It's also pretty much impossible for me to read signs of any sort.  As long as I don't need to read anything more than a foot away, I can function bare-eyed all day. </p><p> </p><p>I have been experimenting with wearing plus lenses to simulate higher amounts of myopia.  I bought some +3.25 reading glasses, which effectively made my vision that of someone with about -8.75D of myopia.  I was still able to get around campus okay while bare-eyed during the day, but I don't think it would take much more to make navigation impossible.  I'm thinking -12D would be close to the upper limit.  Beyond that, there's simply not enough useful vision to perceive and avoid obstacles.  You'd be bumping into everything.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2011, 09:55</p><p>Of course, with glasses on, as they almost always are, I see things a tad better.  :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2011, 09:54</p><p>Jen, </p><p> </p><p>As one with -9.00, all I can see of this page two feet away are blue lines for the links, and black blurs for the regular words.  At distances, I see just a jumble of colors.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2011, 14:47</p><p>jen </p><p>There is no set in stone number of when someone could no longer go without glasses full time. Age and accommodation makes it somewhat different for everyone. That being said I would think that -3.00 would be considered as full time wear for most. A person needing -6.00 or -9.00 would see only blur after a few feet and would certainly be full time. If you knew someone with -3.00 glasses and you borrowed them your eyes could probably adjust to them after a short while for distance but you would probably have a lot of trouble seeing to read a book at a normal distance.  </p><p>Ask your friend if you can try her glasses on for a few minutes and I think you will get a pretty good idea of what she can see without them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jen</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2011, 11:18</p><p>when would you have no choice to wear fulltime? how much would you see with -3 -6 -9</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2011, 12:44</p><p>jen </p><p>Sorry!  I forgot to respond to your earlier question of when someone would need to wear glasses to get around. This is a question that has many answers. Often it is more determined by the wearer. Some people feel and say they are blind without their glasses at very low rxs, others can tolerate a rather strong rx and wear glasses seldom. Most doctors would say between -1.50 and -2.00 is when it gets more difficult to do without glasses or contacts. However because glasses have become a big fashion accessory many wear glasses full time with very weak rxs of as little as -.50 or even no rx at all. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2011, 12:33</p><p>jen </p><p>If you are interested to know how it would be to be somewhat nearsighted, meaning your distance vision is blurry, next time your in a store that sells over the counter readers find a pair of say +2.00 or +2.50 glasses and put them on. Now try looking in the distance at signs or other things. Everything should be out of focus and blurry after a short distance. This is what someone that is moderately nearsighted sees without glasses. Your friends vision is a good deal worse than this test will show. May I ask if there is a reason you are asking about glasses? Are you considering wearing glasses yourself?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jen</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2011, 10:55</p><p>no i dont wear glasses so dont know what its like to have bad vision</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2011, 12:14</p><p>Jen - your friend's script is a bit less than my gf's but if her eyesight is similar then she won't do very much uncorrected.

<p><b>murky</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2011, 17:32</p><p>The most exciting eye trick for me is to borrow some ladies low plus glasses,( they often leave them on the desk) and wear them round the office, like they are yours,exclaiming how good they are to wear... waiting for her to claim them back,hours often!    then ask for her old pair to try , usually a slight prescription change, and wear them claiming "I am just trying them out", and see what the office staff say, I have done it a few times, quite stimulating, in a fetishy way to see how people look at you.. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2011, 12:32</p><p>Two nice sightings of late.  </p><p> </p><p>1) About a -1.25 asian girl who whipped out a chunky plastic pair with a tiger stripe pattern to read the board at Starbucks. She was right in that sweet spot between being able to function and starting to need them. She was working her eyes intensely behind the glasses trying to force them to see further and kept one hand on the arm being both shy and trying to get her eyes to work well enough to take them off. They weren't that strong especially when I looked from behind but the frame choice made them look stronger than they actually were. </p><p> </p><p>2) Lucious black woman who kept a stylish semi rimless pair on her head at the supermarket. Thought they were reading glasses but she did take them off her head and held them with out with one arm for a bit before putting them on to see things and saw they were actually pretty strong high index, about -5 or worse. Pretty much vanity keeping them off at all times, she looked amazing wearing them when she did though. Didnt get a chance to chat her up as she was already on her way to the checkout and I'd just walked in. Wondered how she managed to do her shopping comfortably like that though</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2011, 12:28</p><p>Tom you should expect to see more and more of that. Thanks to all the small devices out there. Also because of the over the counter readers it makes it easy for them to self prescribe. I have come across more than one young person that wears those.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2011, 07:39</p><p>Was in a shoe store over lunchtime. A mother and daughter trying on Birkenstock sandals. The daughter (in her late twenties Iâd say) was struggling to adjust the buckle of a strap. I saw her ask something to her mother, upon which the latter handed over her reading glasses to her daughter. She put them on and quickly managed to get the strap fixed. </p><p>Interesting to see a young lady like her being apparently that  farsighted at fairly young age.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>myopeinhere</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2011, 07:52</p><p>Yes,know it well,was recently with a lovely -9 lady,watching tv she wasnt wearing her glasses as she'ld just popped in the shower,came back and sat down with me and the vacant look was amazing,just not even worth a squint </p><p>She eventually gave in and said I cant see a thing,dried her hair,popped the lovely specs back on and instant back on this planet..</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2011, 04:12</p><p>Very intriguing sighting!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Like lenses</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2011, 23:20</p><p>Cite Monger </p><p>  Yes that vacant unfocused look in the eyes of a myopic woman is quite alluring. </p><p>  At minus 9 or so it is at the max, but it actually begins at about minus 2.00.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cite Monger</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2011, 15:36</p><p>Encountered a very stimulating situation the other night while waiting for a table at a restaurant with my wife.  It looked like several sisters were there showing each other pictures and things on each others iPhone.  But there was this woman with very pretty eyes in the middle who looked semi-dazed.  Each time the phone was passed her way, she took out a pair of very thick lens glasses, probably -8 or -9, and gripping both arms with her hands, thrust them over her eyes, look at the phone and then rapidly put the glasses back.  She must have repeated this 5 or 6 times, and heavens it was driving me crazy.  Particularly because each time she removed the glasses and went back to the blur, she looked more dizzy and had this very lost look.  Her eyes just seemed to increase more in their sexiness with each glasses pass.  She eventually stowed the glasses and peered out at everyone with this blurry stare. </p><p> </p><p>But sadly I had to maintain a supposed lack of interest while my wife continuously spoke to me about this or that.  Here I wanted to leap on the other woman as she was driving me stimulation crazy, but I had to pay attention to her. </p><p> </p><p>They were conveniently seated in the table just behind us, and I saw the woman thrust her glasses on again to read the menu, but then kept them on for the entire duration of the meal.  I wonder if the blur was just too much for her to take.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BillyE</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2011, 14:33</p><p>Not a sighting, but an interesting comment.  A 20 something cousin of mine has just posted on his facebook page something along the lines of "Been wearing my glasses too much, keep pushing them up my nose when I've not got them on".  Seems the family myopia is catching up with him.  Maybe it won't be too long before he goes full time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2011, 10:31</p><p>flaine is so right, I learned many years ago that I would feel much worse if I saw an attractive young lady, mostly wearing glasses of course, and didn't say anything. Later I was very mad at myself for keeping quiet and not making some kind of a comment, nothing ventured, nothing lost. So I soon decided i would say something, usually small talk to start with. In your case you could have easily asked her if she rides this train, bus or whatever as you had not seen her before. Or even since you were reading a newspaper made a comment about not sure why you read the dailies as the news is always bad. I call it an ice breaker. You would get an idea at that if she wants to chat or not very quickly. Of course you will have failures where the answer may be a quick yes or no and they will look away or something. But then you don't care anymore anyway, and at least you know you tried. From what you described it sounds like she was wanting a comment and none came. Even in my older years I still do this if I see a good looking woman of any age. I've never been cursed at or slapped so I think that is a good sign. haha! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Flaine</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2011, 02:51</p><p>Lazysiow, </p><p> </p><p>Was her glasses rather striking/lens rather thick for -4? I think sometimes, its better for a man to say something in these circumstances that ur attention was rather obvious on her, thinking that her true identity is hidden behind those glasses was probably the obstacle preventing you from a direct communication. Thus, this might be the reason why she took off her glasses for a period of time, it was rather sort of losening the tension of the atmosphere if u read it enough i guess..and then seeing u not striking a conversation, she might have thought that she have actually acted wrongly in this situation, thus rushing off at the end of the line..of course, this happens ONLY if she had realised ur OBVIOUS attention on her rather than thinking u actually did..somehow, at this point, i think we woman feel a sense of insecurity. </p><p> </p><p>Hope that helps:)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2011, 00:02</p><p>To describe this sighting, was sitting across from a 'quietly beautiful' asian girl, about a -4 D&amp;G; glasses, I thought they made her quite attractive in an unusual kind of way. I must have been pretty fascinated was likely staring quite intensely at her trying to figure out if I was actually attracted lol. I was also reading a paper at the time and eventually went back to it. When I looked up again, I saw that she had taken them off and now sitting sort of sideways and very shy looking. Now I couldn't tell if she liked my attention or not, but at the very least she seemed very self conscious now like maybe her glasses were the reason I hadn't talked to her yet? I probably should have at this point but couldn't read the situation well enough. The next time I saw her, she'd put them back on again and we both got off at the end of the line, when I turned around to say something though she'd already disappeared. </p><p> </p><p>So.. ladies, verdict on this, was this a creep out? or did I just make someone who is probably really shy even shyer?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2011, 17:38</p><p>Mad Seyentist </p><p>You are most likely correct. Too bad none of them wore minus glasses because i'm sure they would have came out for testing as well and you would have found out for sure. I guess you don't want to give yourself away by suggesting she get an eye exam?  </p><p>A young lady that I new was interested in wearing glasses for fashion and I don't have any samples that are plano because we use them as test pairs for our vision group. So the weakest ones i have are -.50, anyway she tried them on and said just like the girl in your office that they made everything blurry. I had only one pair that was a +.50 and sure enough she found them perfect and wears them now for more than fashion only. She probably could use +1.00's now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mad Seyentist</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2011, 15:46</p><p>We had an interesting experience in our office the other day.  Girls who don't wear glasses were trying on this girl's glasses which were strong plus lenses.  Many of the girls said everything looked magnified and larger.  But one girl said the glasses made her world just a blurry mess and couldn't even read close up print anymore. </p><p> </p><p>I thought this was interesting because in my experience of wearing plus lenses as reading glasses, if I am wearing contact lenses, they work like magnifiers and make everything easier to read.  But if I have my contact lenses out and am seeing nearsighted and blurry, plus readers seem to have the opposite effect and blur everything even more. </p><p> </p><p>Based on that, I believe the girl who said she couldn't see at all through the glasses is nearsighted.  She doesn't wear glasses, but I bet she is hiding her blur from everyone based on this experience.  She gave out her secret without anyone but me realizing it. </p><p> </p><p>Anyone ever noticed something like this before where one person can't see at all trying on plus lenses?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2010, 10:45</p><p>I have always enjoyed flying, partly because it seems the women in airports and planes are often wearing glasses. I think it's because the air on planes dries out eyes and makes it difficult for some to wear contacts. But I had a sighting the other day that was definitely a first. After a short flight I was getting off plane and the pilots were greeting passengers. One of the pilots was tall, attractive, dark haired woman wearing rimless glasses. She did not have a strong prescription, but they were definitely minus glasses. And for all of you who might be afraid to fly with a bespectacled pilot, the landing was smooth and easy. Obviously her depth perception is okay.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eye Tri</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2010, 10:42</p><p>In the early 90s I was racing at Road Atlanta. On Friday night we decided to go into Atlanta to celebrate a successful event. We went into a strip club that I think was called the Cheetah III. In this club they had dancers on three stages at the same time and some of them were wearing glasses. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, beautiful women taking off everything but their glasses. The girls in glasses seemed to be popular ,as people were having them do table dances. </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately I've never been back (Atlanta is a long way from where I live). Maybe someone can tell us if there are still GWGs dancing there. It's a very pleasant memory!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2010, 07:25</p><p>Went to a strip club over the weekend while out of town, and one of the strippers seemed to be very nearsighted.  She kept squinting, and very hard squinting, when she came close to the edge of the stage.  Then she would pretend like everything is normal, but had this very lost look to her eyes.  Maybe she lost her glasses, broke them, or just needs them very bad, but I dunno it was so sexy it drove me crazy, and I really wanted a lap dance with her but was told she was booked for the night.  I know that when I go back, I will be there looking for some time with her.</p><p></p><hr>

At some stage she kept them off for a while and she was blinking madly squinting from time to time.

<p><b>Observing Owl</b>&nbsp;26 May 2010, 09:53</p><p>Last week I was in a train station getting ready to depart on a short trip, and I noticed this very attractive woman standing near the arrivals/departures screens having what looked like a seriously hard time reading the board.  She squinted several different ways, and honestly I was getting around watching.   </p><p> </p><p>But then the unbelievable happened!  She said, "I can't see the board from this far, can I please borrow your glasses for a minute?"  O M G.  I couldn't believe she asked that, but of course I gave them to her.

<p><b>ChrisB</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2009, 14:45</p><p>A few years ago I worked in an office where a colleague had an rx of -8. His daughter helped out in the University holidays. She was in fact very pretty but there was something odd about the way she looked into the middle distance, unfocussed but still returning a smile (or my smile at least)   One day she came in with the intention of driving her dad home, but this time wearing glasses. Her rx must have been at least -3 or 4. When someone who can focus returns your focus you get a subconcious feeling when their attention has come to rest. Thats whats mssing with someone who's myopic.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Visitor2</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2009, 10:19</p><p>I have always observed. But I now see the need to participate. Persons who are more myopic usually have unfocused eyes. From -3.00 up though.  I am -4.00 and whenever I take off my glasses my daughter usually tells me to put them on back.  She mentioned that my eyes appear "ghostly". This is embarrasing because she usually say it around others. Since she has mentioned it,I have noticed that other myopes with -4.00 and over have this unfocused look in their eyes without glasses. I agree that this is a physical way of detecting myopes who really need glasses. What about the early stage of myopia? Any physical signs?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2009, 14:28</p><p>Getting closer to look at something or read something, or holding things further away.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curious</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2009, 11:03</p><p>I got thinking about this the other day and started wondering.  There are alot of women out there who try to hide the fact they need glasses or contacts, and live their world in somewhat of a blur.  I've been wondering that If they don't squint, is there a change to their physical appearance or behavior that gives away someone who needs glasses?  Are the eyes more glassy?  Pupils more dilated?  Redness around the eyes?   </p><p> </p><p>I remember reading one site that gave warning signs about whether your child needs glasses, and one that stood out to me was "peculiar looking eyes" but with no further definition.  It does seem to me that women with particularly attractive eyes seem to need glasses, but I am not sure if that is what is being referred to here. </p><p> </p><p>Does anyone else here have any observations they can add?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Icing</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2009, 11:23</p><p>Had a visit to the skin doctor yesterday and there was a young girl and what appeared to be her mother sitting in the waiting room.  There was a television across the room and the mother was actively watching it and asking her daughter to look at different things on the tv screen.  What stood out to me was that the young teen was obviously quite nearsighted because she squinted madly to look at the tv screen from where she sat.  But the second her mother faced toward her, she immediately stopped squinting.  Back and forth this went for about ten minutes until the nurse came for me.  Made me think that the young girl is probably hiding the fact that she is nearsighted from her mother. </p><p> </p><p>Has anyone ever seen anything like this?</p><p></p><hr>

Now she does wear them for close up like reading and computer but eventhough the optometrist told her that she does need them for distance as well she says they're crap for distance, it's blurry and above all she doesn't like to see through plastic lenses which do not render the true aspect of things like colours, shades... She says that she prefers a blurry vision and prefers even squinting and struggling to see clearly than looking through those lenses. So i'm excited to watch her squint and struggle to see as i am quite fond of it. She was talkiing to friends about it and started simulating a squint and getting stuff closer to her eyes, saying that would be much better than wearing thoses lenses....Looking forward to it but she's not yet at that stage but getting there!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;05 May 2009, 06:24</p><p>Fascinated man </p><p>I was carrying out some interviews at the British Council offices in London some time ago and was being shown around a department by the manager. She was mid-thirties and sat peering at me from across her desk while I talked to her. We got up to take a tour of the department and while we were going round, some people a short distance away would speak to her but she usually just squinted at them and didnt reply. </p><p> </p><p>On getting back to her desk she picked up a document to read and then took out a pair of pink tinted at least -6.00 glasses. After we had finished reading, she immediately took her glasses off and squinted at me again. </p><p> </p><p>If she didnt wear glasses outside, how she managed to get around London without being run over is a mystery. </p><p> </p><p>Quite recently I was browsing in a local opticians when an early twenties girl came out after seeing the optometrist, the girl was saying she didnt think she would get glasses as she might just start off with contacts and would decide later, while the optometrist was saying that she really should be wearing glasses. Her notes were put on the counter and I looked at the scrip which said R -4.25/L -3.75, quite how she functioned without any glasses is also something of a mystery. </p><p> </p><p>It just goes to show there are some quite high myopes around who just dont wear glasses and still manage to get around alright. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fascinated Fan</b>&nbsp;05 May 2009, 05:17</p><p>I've always been fascinated by women who don't wear their glasses, and so obviously need them.  It is very sexually exciting to see a women squint.  Just the other day I saw a woman drive into a parking space next to me, and after stopping the car, she took off these amazingly thick glasses and put them away.  She then got out of the car like nothing was different, but she had to be blind as a bat.  My heart almost stopped!  Does anyone know women like this?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dependancy Factor</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2007, 10:42</p><p>Tim... come on.  Didn't you know the Romanian women work out of studios that have the computers, and who said anything about them being high tech?  They are basic computers with webcams, and not much else.  It works the same way out of other third world countries too.  I've talked with some of the girls before and they say that if they are very good workers (bring in lotsa money), they sometimes get to have a work computer in their home and can work from there. </p><p> </p><p>That's why they can afford to be on the internet, but not afford glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2007, 21:29</p><p>So these Romanians can afford state-of-the-art computers and broadband access, but not a pair of specs? Eh? Here in Yemen broadband access alone costs half a month's salary for the average Yemeni!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dependancy Factor</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2007, 06:07</p><p>I will be honest and admit that I enjoy online cam sex, okay there I said it.  But what I find most interesting are the women I meet who are willing to play with their glasses for you.  Most of the sites allow you to see thumbnails of the rooms before you enter and you can pick one with some good glasses.  I prefer <a href="http://www.cams.com/" target="_blank">http://www.Cams.com</a> and <a href="http://www.streamate.com/" target="_blank">http://www.Streamate.com</a> most of all.  Check out GeishaGirl and DarkAngel13 for some serious glasses pleasure. </p><p> </p><p>But I have also discovered many women on these sites who need glasses but don't have any.  Wow that is such an attraction to me, and if you pick the right girl, they are willing to share stories about their poor vision with you.  There are many girls I have come to meet over the years and some eventually got glasses while others never have so far.  I am not sure if it is because many of the women on those sites are from Romania and other poorer countries, but I recommend them highly! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>not so new guest</b>&nbsp;13 May 2007, 18:51</p><p>All4Eyes - funny you should mention the bare eyed and barefoot thing. A couple of years ago I went to a mall early one morning to see what shops were still in business there. It was still early enough for none of the stores to be open, so it was mostly senior citizens there getting their morning walk in. Anyway, what stood out was this one guy. He was in his early 20's, he was barefoot, just jeans and a t shirt but was wearing some of the thickest glasses I had ever seen. He had to be every bit of a -20.00 myope. I got to thinking about how screwed he would be if he lost or broke his glasses, but imagine how much more helpless he would be if it happened when he was barefoot. Trying to grope around a strange environment when your barefoot would be pretty hard if you couldn't see the ground or what you were stepping on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;10 May 2007, 14:14</p><p>Scott, </p><p>I assume her eyes were bointing outward.  The condition is called exophoria or exotropia depending on certain factors.  It is the opposite of esophoria or esotropia, sometimes called crossed eyes or squint. </p><p>Exophoria is more common in adults and esotropia is more common in children.  Usually, either condition can be corrected by muscle surgery. </p><p>She may have not have had sight in one of her eyes or her brain may have developed the skill of switching vision from one eye to the other.  It is highly unlikely that she had stereoscopic vision. </p><p>I had one person with mild exophoria tell me that his peripheral vision was excellent, with a chuckle. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2007, 13:45</p><p>I figure this qualifies for the "Nearsightings" thread, since it's not so much a description of one particular sighting as a general observation I've made. For those of you who have a "bare-eyed and bare-foot fetish" (I myself have the former but not the latter), might I suggest going to martial arts classes? When I was a kid, I had a friend who took karate and sometimes I would go and watch his lessons. They had this room in the back where everybody would change out of their street clothes and into those white suits with the various colors of belts, depending on their skill level, and take off their shoes and socks and glasses (if they wore them). The action out on the floor at one of these places is probably right up a "bare-eyed and bare-foot" persons' alley, though I myself preferred to hang out in the changing room and play with everyone's glasses while they were out there breaking boards with their fists and such. Everybody was Kung-fu fighting-Hiy-yahhh! Incidentaly, that kid's mother one day out of the blue announced to me that he had had his eyes checked and the doctor had said he was a little nearsighted, but not enough to need glasses right now, although he probably would in another year or two. Unfortunately, they moved away before I got to see this great happening. 8-(   </p><p> </p><p>What do y'all think of my new sign-off? I figure putting my name on there will at least stop any gender confusion my unisex nick might cause (I'd considered calling myself "Miss Myopia", kind of a take-off on the Miss America thing, but then thought "No, if anyone's going to be Miss Myopia, it wouldn't be wimpy little -4 me" Actually, I think at the moment Aliena has my vote for that, a great writer of glasses stories (real and fictional), studying to become an opthalmologist (or she was last time I heard, anyway), and she just happens to really need myodiscs, too, she's my hero!). </p><p>I ALWAYS make passes at guys who wear glasses, Marie </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2006, 16:59</p><p>I guess the Nearsightings thread is the place for this, since its not really a Sighting per se (its about my Mom and I). This is more of a wish you couldve been here postcard or a virtual sighting for you guys. Picture it: A smart, funny, myopic woman in the I can read better with my glasses off stage is sitting at her computer, playing a trivia game in a mIRC room; her smart, funny, myopic (not to mention beautiful) 22 year old daughter is sitting beside her, looking over her shoulder and playing along. The problem with this room is that the background is black, the writing white and various neon colors, which is quite difficult for your lovely ladies to read, although no one else seems to have trouble with it. The regular questions- (these are all ones I got. What does a dipsomaniac crave? Alcohol. 60s music: Name the artist Lets live for today? The Grass Roots. (Im really good at music trivia!) What is the capital of Czechoslovakia? Prauge. (Bobbyd have been so proud!) werent too hard, but over half the questions were like this: Unscramble this word: shta? Hats. Only they didnt use short, easy words, they used words like Unsportsmanshiplikenesses. So there we were, my Mom bare-eyed and squinting, me squinting and tilting my glasses and tilting my head to look through the bottom part of my lenses and everything else I can think of to try to see the screen better. And constantly asking Is that an l or an i? An r or an n? Mother is typing, since shes the faster typist of the two of us. Now, I cant type if I have to be reading to you she says. I say I know, but I cant see. She says Well, Im having trouble, too. It was crazy-we were seeing letters that werent there, not seeing ones that were, and to make matters worse, every time someone got 3 questions in a row right, the bot would type A cold beer for ___ for answering the last 3 questions and we were managing to do this a few times (I told you we are smart!), so it wasnt long before we were virtually drunk! And we totally cracked up! I dont know which was worse, though, the sideache I had from all the laughing or the headache I had from all the squinting (or maybe it was the virtual beer)! So there you have it, two nearsighted women having a ball, with their intelligence and senses of humor on full display. What could be a better O.O. moment? Ok, now Ill quit bragging on myself (and leave that up to my legions of adoring fans throughout the universe. LOL).  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2005, 14:24</p><p>When they dilate the eyes, it paralyzes and relaxes the lens in the eye.  If the blurriness in her vision is "pseudomyopia" (an inability of the lens to relax), dilating the eyes would give this away.  Without dilating, the blurriness is more likely to be diagnosed as plain old myopia....properly treated with glasses. </p><p> </p><p>If she actually has become myopic (no pseudomyopia), then dilating doesn't make much difference.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2005, 12:08</p><p>John - why would it make any difference if they dilated her eyes? Does this part of the test give something away?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2005, 06:18</p><p>Frank - It's possible that her vision would return to 'normal' after going without the glasses for a while.  But if that didn't happen within a couple days, the change might be permanent. </p><p> </p><p>If she isn't seeing well, a trip to an eye doctor should result in glasses, and they wouldn't "suspect" anything.  People's eyes can change at any point in their lives.   </p><p> </p><p>The only exception would be if the blurriness was "pseudomyopia", basically an inability of the lens in the eye to relax (same as with latent hyperopia).  In that case, they might give drops or exercises to try to get her eyes to relax. </p><p> </p><p>I guess since she wants glasses, she should probably go to a chain optical, someplace where the exam won't be quite as thorough.  She should make sure they don't put drops in here eyes to dilate them (if they want to, she can just say she has to do some paper work shortly after the exam, so she can't have her eyes dilated).  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Frank</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2005, 04:15</p><p>A girlfriend of mine with good vision told me she always wanted to need glasses, and her quest eventually became her obsession!  She would always talk about how she wondered what it is like to see things blurry.  She told me how she would sit in class and try to blur her vision by on her own by straining her eyes, but that took alot of concentration.  As she got older, she would borrow her friends glasses and even tried to fool the eye doctor during tests, but later I found out she was unsuccessful.  About six months ago she bought a pair of eyeglasses from a thrift shop and even though she said they were strong, she kept wearing them as much as possible progressing all the way up to full time wearing.  Well a few days ago she told me she lost them, and guess what, her eyes had adjusted so much to the glasses, she said she now had trouble seeing without them!  She asked me if she could go to the doctor and get real eyeglasses now, and would they believe her.  I told her that I thought it might just be an adjustment and within a few weeks her vision could return to normal.  But I am not sure.  Can someone answer this?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2005, 20:59</p><p>I went to the movies last night to watch "Mr &amp; Mrs Smith". My wife went to 'powder her nose' before it started. A couple walked in and sat behind me - nothing interesting - until i heard the girl say "i forgot to put my contacts in". She then asked her date if he has his glasses with him. He replied "no". Then she asked him "where are they?". He told her that they are in the car. Both were too lazy to go and get them, so they both ended up watching the movie in a blur. I though it was interesting to report :/</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2005, 10:03</p><p>I know that it's been awhile, but I promised you guys that I would give you another story about my modeling days.  Back when I had just left high school, my friends talked me into trying out to be a model.  Personally, I really thought that guys would be hung up on my hips because they are a big huge, but some of the guys I dated thought they were nice.  So I decided to give it a shot. </p><p> </p><p>I had these really cool pictures done at a studio, and brought my glasses along.  At this time I was a full time wearer like you guys like to say here.  Anyway, so I come in to take the shots, and the photographer tells me that I have really hot eyes, but that my glasses cover them up.  I thought that was a great compliment, and little did he know how much I love my eyes as well.  So after taking a few shots with my glasses, I took them off for a few more.  I remember how blurry things got and so I guess I tried to focus too hard because the photographer kept asking me to stop squinting.  Well, great advice guy, because when I didn't squint, the blur was worse.  It was something to do with the combination of lighting in there, but I felt so dizzy and blind without my glasses there.  It was harder that I could have believed because when I went without glasses outside, the blur wasn't nearly as strong. </p><p> </p><p>Well, so after I got the pictures and all, I thought I did look much better without the glasses.  There goes my self criticism again!  Anyway, I made this appointment to go see this talent agency.  When I went there, it was really weird.  They looked over my photos, and asked to stand up, and turn around.  And then of course, you guessed it, the lady who was interviewing me reached for my glasses and took them off.  "You have such amazing eyes, darling, you really need to throw away these silly glasses!"  Well, I kinda liked my glasses so I said to her that I couldn't see without them.  She said it wasn't a big problem but I should try to get contacts because my glasses were just dominating my face.  Hmmm... </p><p> </p><p>When I went home, I had to reason with myself.  I took off my glasses and looked into the mirror.  I sort of enjoy the blur, but it gets me dizzy if I go around too long without them.  I got real close in the mirror and looked at my eyes better.  I knew they were one of my biggest assets (okay guys ONE of my biggest assets) and decided to go try out the contacts thing.  I like my black frame horn rims, but if that is what it took to get the job, I was gonna give it a shot. </p><p> </p><p>More on how that went later.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bespectacled Professor</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2005, 10:34</p><p>Julie, </p><p> </p><p>Do you wear glasses today, or did you switch to contacts when you began modeling?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2005, 09:52</p><p>Well, I haven't meant to stay away as long as I did, but since you guys still sound interested, I'll give you the scoop on some more of my memories. </p><p> </p><p>Those days back in high school really convinced me that I needed to start wearing my glasses full time.  The more I wore them, it was like I became addicted to them and my eyes seemed to get real whacked without them.  And I mean really whacked!  It is amazing how different your world and personality can be when you live in a world of blur and can't really see what's going on far away.  For awhile people commented on my glasses, and I got alot more attention from the guys.  Most of the girls wanted to try my glasses on, and more than a few said they were way strong.  The guys that I could actually see again started showing an interest in me that I hadn't expected.  Something about a long haired blonde with blue eyes and black horn rimmed 1950s style glasses seemed to set them off.  I started to get used to that crowd and I got more popular.  But I did notice that some guys seemed to be more interested in my glasses than me! </p><p> </p><p>Remember my babies?  I kept those for years, and continued to wear them in private because of the hot feelings it gave me to suddenly be thrust into an intense blurry world.  But guys, I gotta tell you, after a few years when my own eyes got worse and worse, I started to see clearer and clearer out of my babies.  So I had to try to find stronger ones, and that wasn't easy.  I took several trips to the local thrift shops and left my glasses in my purse.  By that time, I was almost -8 and it was getting very difficult to see anything without glasses.  I couldn't see things clearly without pushing my nose into them!  So I had to ask my way around the store, but I didn't want to ask where the used glasses were and I wandered aimlessly in a few stores before I could find them.  Alot of stores keep their used glasses in a plastic bin and I could sift through them and try them on.  At -8, it took quite a few pairs to find ones that were stronger than mine.  I remember one time I found a great pair and when I went to the cashier, she was just a soft unfocused blur.  She rang up the glasses and just waited and waited.  Eventually she said "Miss.. that will be $2."  When I thought about it, I was in such a daze but I guess she expected me to be able to read the total from her screen which was completely out of the question!  But it always made my heart race everytime because I always feared that one of my posse would see me buying these glasses and they would wonder why I wasn't wearing my glasses and what is going on.  But I really found some great babies this way, and they were nice and cheap! </p><p> </p><p>A few years later my friends tried to convince me that I was a hottie and twisted my arm to try out for modeling.  Let me tell you how all that went next time...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>xisle</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2005, 13:32</p><p>im currently at -9.5 on my script and i have never worn glasses. i have been wearing contacts for years. i was just curious if i went with a smaller frame and 1.67 high index lenses, what would be my edge thickness on my glasses. im guess in like 5mm but thats just a guess. if anyone can give me some info on thickness it would be apriciated</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2005, 11:05</p><p>My cousin, in addition to being very highly myopic, has all kinds of eye problems and has always seen ophthalmologists - she has gotten good care from them and they stopped a serious problem before it could go too far. But she felt like one of her eyes was getting lazy because for years the vision following laser surgery was pretty poor in that eye, and not fabulous in the other.  </p><p> </p><p>She visited an optometrist for her most recent glasses RX change, and she says she is seeing better than she has in years, and that everything is now sharp in both eyes. It sounds like your friend might profit from visiting both an optometrist and an ophthalmologist. A school of optometry might be his best option.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2005, 10:46</p><p>On the same topic - saw him today and asked him, and he said he hadn't been for a test yet. He tried my glasses on again, and said he could see a woman at the other end of the bar, which he couldn't make out without them. I offered to try out my trial lenses on him, and he agreed - he didn't seem surprised that I have them - he knows I was on an optometry course for a while though. Should be interesting :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2005, 16:07</p><p>J Smith UK - I don't know, he hasn't said that he has, but I will ask him when I see him. He wasn't too sure where to go as he has retinitis pigmentosa &amp; he thought an ordinary optician might not be able to test him properly - I think they would. He has never been to one, only to the hospital opthalmologist, and he doesn't remember having a proper refraction done. It was funny - he was amazed that everything was clearer, and said 'it would be great - I could get some contacts'! Would love to see him in glasses though :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2005, 11:24</p><p>A couple of 'speccy' incidents today.. I was having coffee with a friend &amp; I took my glasses off to clean them. I don't think she has seen me without them because she said (loudly) 'oh my god you have got beautiful eyes - you should wear contact lenses!' If I had been feeling brave I would have told her that I like wearing glasses, but somehow it seemed like she would think I was mad. Coming on here, I forget that people think like her. Then later on I was shopping with another friend, trying sunglasses on. I asked him to hold my glasses for me (the -3s) &amp; he put them on. First of all he pretended that he was going to fall over (!) but then he said 'actually, I can see clearer with these - is that meant to happen?' He has never worn glasses so I suggested he go for an eye test &amp; he said he would. Will be interesting to see what happens.. :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;02 Feb 2005, 07:32</p><p>I guess this is the thread for this...I talked to an old, very good, friend last night who I hadn't spoken to in a long time.  She used to be a -6/-7 myope, usually in contacts but occasionally in glasses, and strikingly beautiful in either case.  While the beauty part is still there, the myopia is (sort of) no longer...now lost to Lasik.  She's excited, and I tried to be happy for her.  "Now I can see the alarm clock when I wake up in the morning," she said, like everyone else who gets Lasik.  That seems like such a natural thing to say and be excited about, but my view of it changed completely when I heard someone point out how crazy it is; what, really, is the significance of being able to read the alarm clock in the morning?  I mean, do you even really want to know what it says?  It seems like this is one of the last things a person would want to be able to see.    Well, for someone who was dependent on glasses as a child and probably had some bad experiences with that, there's probably a strong sense of "freedom" in not having to wear glasses or contacts.  Still, without something truly problematic about glasses or contacts, it seems like a waste. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2005, 18:03</p><p>MattP, I think I can answer your question:  they are not myodisc lenses.  The circular shadows you see are typical of strong minus lenses when a strong light such as the sun or more particularly, camera flash, is projected on them.  The cut in goes right to the edge of the lens in this photo, whereas with myodiscs, the cut in would be contained within the circular disc of minus lens.  The outer carrier would show no cut in or maybe a "plus" effect.  It's hard to describe in words... hope this helps. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2005, 18:02</p><p>I think it's the "shadow" that is created by minus lenses, nothing else.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2005, 14:06</p><p>By the time I ran into my old friend, I had been wearing the glasses nearly all day except for that class.  She got right up into my face and said "Let me see your glasses, Julie."  She said it calmly but I felt nervous because her and I haven't really talked since I busted up her own glasses.   </p><p> </p><p>"They're just part of my costume..."  She took off her glasses and reached for mine, literally taking them right off my face.  I watched almost helplessly as I slipped back into my familiar but more blurry world.  I remember shaking my head for a moment because it was a big change.  The nervousness of seeing her and the fact she had my lifeline to clear vision resting in her hands made me tense.  Then suddenly she thrust her own glasses onto my eyes and the blur disappeared again.  I could see that she was wearing my glasses and squinting through the lenses.  "Okay well then let me play secretary girl too, okay... WOW, these are strong glasses and no way these are part of your costume!"  Her glasses were quite a bit stronger than I needed and I had bite my lip to fight off erotic feelings climbing inside me.  Her glasses reminded me so much of my precious babies. </p><p> </p><p>"Soooo... you aren't mad at me?  Please please don't tell anyone they are for real."  She told me "Girl you can't keep this up, you needed glasses a long time ago and I can tell that your eyes are so bad now you can barely see without them."  She gave me my glasses back and my hands were shaking because I knew I was discovered.  She reached out and picked her own glasses off my face, and I replaced them with my own right away.  I needed to let the erotic feelings die a quick death, so I bit my lip harder!  "I'll keep your secret, but you know you are gonna have to let it out sooner or later." </p><p> </p><p>We both walked away but I was really more nervous than ever because I didn't know if she would really keep my secret.  Today I was able to get away with it because it was Halloween, and we were supposed to go out to a party that night.  But what about tomorrow and from then on?  And what about the guy who asked me out today but laughed a bit at my glasses.  He had never spoken to me before and now that I could see him better, I really wanted to date him.  Wanna know what happened the next day? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mark</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2005, 08:37</p><p>yeah Julie, great story. </p><p> </p><p>gwgs - i suggest that maybe you leave a pair of glasses in a subtle small frame with a weak prescription in your living room on in the bathroom if you share it with her for a few days and she might be tempted to try it on, i sure would be if i saw glasses lying around. </p><p> </p><p>This i think is the best idea, leave glasses around with maybe a -2 or slightly stronger prescription if you've got them and see if she makes any comments about the spex.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2005, 01:12</p><p>WOW. </p><p> </p><p>What a tale Julie, you really shouldn't be getting my body this excited this early in the morning! </p><p> </p><p>What was your prescription again? Love the comments your friend made in the car. </p><p> </p><p>Look forward to hearing what your friend whose glasses you broke had to say about your spec-tacular new look.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2005, 12:58</p><p>I've been busy like a bee for awhile, but have found some time to write again!   </p><p> </p><p>Let me talk about Halloween.  That day I stepped outside the house for the first time in my glasses and the world looked so much different than I'd ever seen before.  I remember being able to see my friend at such an amazing distance as she pulled up in the car to pick me up for school.  She had to say something "Girl you are looking hot, are those real??  Let me see how they look."  So she grabs my glasses and puts them on... and through the blur I see that she suddenly takes them back off quickly.  "WOW... these are real and strong!  Where did you get them?"  I told her I'd borrowed them from someone but she wouldn't let up.  "Girl you finally got glasses!"  Lucky for me this was my friend who knew how bad my eyesight was.  I told her the truth but promised her to keep quiet because I did not want anyone to know.  Of course I had to listen to her lecture all the way to school about how bad my eyes are.  But I remember tuning her out, because all around me I could see sharpness and clarity like never before.    Wearing my glasses around the house made a difference but it was nothing compared to what they did for my eyes outside.      I would take off my glasses, enter into the unfocused world, squint into the distance and try to see as far as I could, and then put my thick lenses back on.  No matter how hard I squinted I could not see as clearly as with the glasses...  "Girl are you listening to me, you need to keep those glasses on all the time or somebody will figure it out."  </p><p>Okay, okay she had a point.  But I was sort of enjoying the back and forth blurry thing. </p><p> </p><p>At school I got alot of compliments about how great my secretary outfit looked and was very surprised at the number of guys that seemed to like a blonde chick better in black horn rim glasses.  I got a couple of numbers that day of guys I thought were cute but could never really see that well.  I felt so good being able to see everyone but maybe I played it up too much because I couldn't see very far before and suddenly I was acting like I could see so good now. </p><p> </p><p>One teacher was very rude and when I walked into class, she demanded we all remove costumes.  That meant I had to take off the glasses, and I slipped out of the clarity and into my own personal world again.  I couldn't see anything in class, and I had been wearing my glasses for hours that day, so the sudden change left me reeling.  I told the teacher I needed to go see the nurse, and she let me go. </p><p> </p><p>Things seemed to be going great, but then I ran into my old girlfriend.  Yep, the one whose glasses I broke awhile before and this time she wasn't smiling either...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2005, 09:47</p><p>GWGS, It was fun! I had a blast! Also, i ran into someone who lives near where i do, and they had just gotten new glasses, and let me try them on. The prescription in them was too weak for me, but of course it was just right for them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2005, 02:51</p><p>Tammy, you are damn right about your story, i wish i could have been there to see it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daffy</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2005, 18:52</p><p>Sherise - I was almost in your shoes too. My parents couldn't afford to buy me glasses. I was age 19 before they could afford to get me glasses. My last two years of school were affected (the grades dropped) as i could not see what the teacher wrote. I relied on my mates next to me. My first Rx was -3.75. The optometrist couldn't believe i waited so long. Like you, i just shrugged my shoulders, and he called me 'the blind guy'.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Don</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2005, 16:51</p><p>Sherise, I'm sorry to hear you had to go that long of a time,before you got your first pair of glasses.Whats your age now? And whats your RX? Talk to you later.  Don</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sherise</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2005, 13:00</p><p>I guess I have a strange story to tell. </p><p> </p><p>It seems like most people here had a choice whether or not to get glasses, but when I grew up my parents could not afford to get me the glasses I needed.  Each year I went to school it seemed like more and more distance slipped away into the blur surrounding me.  After a few years, the squinting didn't seem to help much anymore.  My friends used to offer me their glasses all the time but I could never get used to the strength of the lenses and I would get real dizzy.  I just learned how to live with it. </p><p> </p><p>By the time I got my first pair of glasses, I was sixteen.  The eye doctor said that -5 was a strong prescription for a first time customer, but I let my parents off the hook and shrugged my shoulders.  When I got the glasses, my whole life completely changed.  If you can imagine going from years and years of -5 to a sharp precise 20/20 in an instant!   </p><p> </p><p>It sounds weird now but that was an emotional struggle to deal with and even today I feel more comfortable in the blur and often sit around the house that way.  My vision is a bit worse, but growing up for so long one way, you feel more like the blur is your home. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>squinty</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2005, 19:46</p><p>and from what you've reported before Tammy, this would be a VERY unusual "sighting" for you!  </p><p> </p><p>"you really know your glasses are strong when EVEN YOU are shocked to look thru someone elses specs and they are JUST AS STRONG..." </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for the fun sighting!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2005, 18:07</p><p>I don't know where to put this so i am putting it here. I went to Walmart today with a group of other people, and at one point, some of us were sitting in the snackbar talking, and i don't know this got started, but before we left the store, some of us were trying on each others glasses. There were 3 of us sitting there with glasses on, and first i tried on the person sitting to my left's glasses, and she tried on mine. She said that mine were too strong for her, and hers were too weak for me, so then the person sitting on my right asked to try on my glasses, so i handed them to her, and i asked if i could look through hers. OMG! I could see almost perfectly through hers! She said that she could see through mine too. Anyway, i thought that was the kind of thing the folks on here would love to hear about. ttfn, Tammy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2004, 06:10</p><p>Nice to hear from you again Julie. </p><p> </p><p>You must lose this self-consciousness you have about wearing your glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>You liked wearing them before, so why don't you like wearing them now. </p><p> </p><p>I find it hard to believe that at -3.75 your eyesight is that bad.

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2004, 05:22</p><p>Sorry guys, been real busy and haven't had the chance to get back here!  Hope you haven't lost interest yet, so I'll give you some more memories. </p><p> </p><p>So now I had glasses, and could see very well with them on, but felt really blind without them.  My parents basically made me wear them around the house, but when I went out the door to meet with friends or go to school, zzzzzip, off they went and tucked into my purse.  I am not sure where things went wrong, but my dizziness and headaches seemed to happen alot more after I got glasses and tried to go around without them.  I remember sitting in class and just looking around from my seat and being overcome by just how blurry things had gotten.  I wondered if things things really becoming much blurrier or was it because I was wearing my strong glasses that my eyes could really see the blur now?  Obviously I couldn't see the board, but I couldn't really read the clock anymore, or see my friends across the room, and it seemed like everything suddenly had some bit of blur.  I couldn't recognize people in the halls from much further than a few feet anymore.   </p><p> </p><p>I continued to play the dizzy act, but really guys, I was getting awfully dizzy.  So I would sometimes skip class and go to the ladie's room, and in private slip out my glasses and wear them for awhile to take away some of the feelings.  But maybe doing that was the wrong thing because it became harder and harder to go from a sharp clear world to a soft blurry world over and over again.  I really had to fight to keep from squinting, and wasn't sure if I had done it without realizing.  I was so afraid that I would be discovered with such bad eyesight.  I remember going out on a few dates to movies and having so much trouble seeing the screen.  And in the dimly lit theater the boys I dated were so very very hard to see even sitting nearby.  So I started to withdraw myself from people because I thought they might recognize what was going on. </p><p> </p><p>But I got an idea.  Halloween was coming up and I decided that I could dress up for school as a secretary and get away with wearing my glasses because people would think they were part of the costume.  I struggled through the blur until that day came and then put my outfit together that morning.  I remember wearing a white blouse, open button at the top to sex it up a little.  I pinned my blond hair back, but left a little hanging on the sides.  I wore a sexy little plaid skirt with no stockings.  I even had a nice pair of black pumps to wear.   </p><p> </p><p>And then my black framed horn rim glasses  put the picture together.  When I saw myself clearly in the mirror, I thought I could pull this off well and get an idea of what people thought I looked in glasses.  If they thought I looked too weird, I could always say they were fake!  So off to school I went that morning. </p><p> </p><p>I'll tell you how Halloween went next, and more about my babies!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anime Fan</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2004, 18:05</p><p>I just had a fun encounter today, an x-girlfriend encounter so to speak. We dated 6 years back, and I noticed that she rarely drove and was always squinting. I had asked her about it a few times, and she just said that her eyes were terrible, but she had contacts in. She'd call in sick when her contacts wouldn't go in, which she was getting from a friend who had a weaker script than she had. I had offered a few times to pay for new contacts and glasses for her, but she felt that her eyes would get even worst with them on so she always turned down the offer.  </p><p> </p><p>She was very particular about my wearing glasses, so I jokingly made the comment that she should wear them to, since I had to. She came by one night and she wore mine. I wasn't sure how well she saw in them, but she held them close to her eyes to look at them, a heavy pair of military frames, since my eyes have been stable for quite a while. So my script is a bit strong, but not too strong. I let her have the glasses, and she said that they would give her eyes a rest around the house.  </p><p> </p><p>Well to make a long story short, I spotted her with a pair with lots of rings, couldn't even guess on the script. She was going through a time when we dated where her eyes were getting worst and worst. We talked for a bit, didn't mention the glasses since she had always been so weird about wearing them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2004, 11:42</p><p>Hey but Julie..................MINUS LENSES, BLACK PLASTIC FRAMES, AND BLONDE HAIR is the SEXIEST COMBINATION IMAGINABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please tell me you still wear black plastics! How old are you now?  Pete</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2004, 10:06</p><p>About the prescription, it might not seem that high to you, but to me it was like a whole different world.  Especially when it rained or got dark, it seemed like my world would just dissolve into blurriness and I could hardly see. </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps the reason I didn't wear my glasses so much was because I deciced to make a statement with them.  I was having fun and picked these thick black horn rim plastic frames that look like they came from the fifties.  My mother and I agreed that they really stood out against my long blonde hair and at the TIME, I wanted that.  Until I realized I was too shy to wear something this loud. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2004, 10:00</p><p>I was so happy that my mother did not say anything to my friends about glasses.  How in the world would I explain that I have been lying about my bad eyes for the longest and suddenly show up wearing thick glasses?  This probably doesn't make sense to you but I wanted to be able to wear glasses so much, but when I got them I was too embarrassed to wear them!  On the way home my mother said she knew that when the time came I would wear my glasses like I need to.  What a relief.  I expected to be roasted for whipping off my glasses, and letting her in on how bad my eyes really are, but she said I would figure out when I need the glasses on my own. </p><p> </p><p>When we got home, I went straight to my room and shut the door.  I saw the blurry image of myself in the mirror again and reached into my pocket for the glasses.  I pulled the lenses over my eyes and everything changed.  Woah.  I could not believe how much different things looked.  I could see the prints on my clothes and even see my long hair and how it was screwed up today and noone told me!  I took the glasses off again and noticed a big power loss as I fell back into the blur.  So I started comparing the images, off and on, on and off.  I really need glasses bad.  I went over and flipped the lock on my door and pulled out my babies.  Now I tried to wear my glasses and put my babies on top.  OMG, I saw how these glasses look when a person with normal eyes looks through them and could not believe their strength.  But honestly it felt nice, if you know what I mean.  I sat there playing with my new glasses for awhile, and tried to adjust my eyes to the increase in sharpness of details.  When I first put my glasses on at the eye doctor, the whole room warped and twisted around me.  I loved that feeling, but didn't want to tell anyone, but I noticed the more I wore my glasses  now the twistiness untwisted more.  I guess now that I probably shouldn't have "enjoyed" myself with my new glasses so much because it made me feel like wearing them was something very intimate, sensual, and private.  How in the world would I wear glasses now? </p><p> </p><p>More later if interested!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2004, 13:24</p><p>Definately keep up the story Julie.  It is interesting.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2004, 12:18</p><p>More of my memories. </p><p> </p><p>We looked through the frames and I had so much fun.  We walked through the mall Thank God it was at the mall, and as we waited for my glasses, we walked around and I freely squinted as hard as I needed to.  My mother said she didn't realize just how hard it was for me to see and I should have said something earlier.  I didn't want to take it any further because we could lead into discussion about my former glasses collection. </p><p> </p><p>When we went back, a different doctor placed the glasses over my eyes.  The lenses seemed a bit thicker than I expected and I wondered how I would look  suddenly wearing strong glasses.  When he slipped the glasses on my eyes, the world changed.  Everything became very sharp and detailed.  I turned around and could actually see my mother sitting in the reception area.  Even the mall was clear from that distance.  Wow for me it was a major change.  He said the doctor suggested that I wear these as much as possible to correct your eyesight.  Okay. </p><p> </p><p>So my mother came over to me and said I looked very nice.  As we started to leave the store, I noticed some friends of mine and quickly removed the glasses.  There was no way I could let them see my glasses yet. </p><p> </p><p>Well, of course there is more, but I will let you enjoy my memories so far for now.  More soon if anyone is still interested! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2004, 12:17</p><p>I couldn't get out of it.  Oh I tried so hard, but I guess I had to face up to it sooner or later.  By this time, I had needed glasses for years and my vision was quite bad.  I absolutely knew the eye doctor would say I needed glasses and that was the scary part. </p><p> </p><p>My mother brought me to the appointment and as we waited around, I noticed lots of other folks there waiting as well.  I got so nervous I went to the bathroom to calm myself down.  As I walked in, I noticed how blurry I looked.  I inched closer and closer to the mirror until all the blur was gone and realized I was only inches away from the mirrors surface.  When I slowly backed away, I watched my body dissolve back into the blur.  I had to face it, my vision was completely wasted.  But then it hit me.  Hey, I could play with my own glasses the same way I play with my babies.  See I enjoyed taking off my babies and putting them on and watching the big transition from strong blur to, well, blur.  Nobody would think it was weird of me to put on my glasses, and I could even do it in public!  Okay girl, you have the right attitude now, so I headed back into the eye doctor. </p><p> </p><p>This time I wanted to make sure I get glasses, so as I came back I squinted around the room toward my mother.  It was difficult, but I could see her.  She saw me and said "Honey, if you have to squint like that, you really need glasses."  I decided to admit it.  "Yes, Mom I think I have very bad eyes."  My mother reassured me it was okay. </p><p> </p><p>When they called my name, I went alone.  I guess she was confident that I would not conceal my nearsightedness any longer.  I sat down in front of some big crazy machine that blew wind in my eyes, and when I asked what it was, the assistant told me that it would help determine my prescription.  But she told me to hold on because she thought it needed adjusting.  The numbers seemed rather high.  She asked if I get dizzy or have blurry vision, and happily I said yes and YES.  "When did you lose your glasses?"  "I never had glasses before."  She looked shocked.  I thought this would be it!  "Hmmm... these are high numbers for a first time wearer."  I liked the sound of that "first time wearer."  We'll let the doctor figure it out. </p><p> </p><p>When I entered the room, I couldn't see the eye chart clearly across the room.  Not even the big E!  The doctor pulled out these lenses and after switching them out he said I definitely need to wear glasses, and full time.  "Madam, your eyes are quite bad, are you sure you've never worn glasses?"  "Um...  I tried on my friend's glasses a few times and could see better.  Does that count?"  There was no WAY I could tell him about my babies!  He said that I should stop doing that and wear my own glasses as often as I needed to.  I still remember that first prescription that he gave to me being a "first time wearer" and all.  It said -3.25 and -4.5.  He told me that my dizziness is caused by unequal vision in each eye.  Well, duh, I knew that one of my eyes was pretty bad and I tried to use the other one more.  But I was so glad to get that piece of paper.  When I came out, I ran to my Mom and told her that I need glasses right away. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lazysiow</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2004, 15:20</p><p>What a story :D </p><p> </p><p>Count me as one eager beaver!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2004, 15:04</p><p>Setting up the eye appointment was bad enoug, but my parents still wanted to know why I had all those glasses and what was I doing with them.  I had to really come up with a story and I told them that I was collecting them for the Lion's Clubs.  People at school gave me their glasses.  But some of the glasses looked pretty old they said, but that was my story and I was sticking to it.  Then she held the pair of glasses in her hands I secretly called my "babies" because I got the most intense experiences from them.  I got really nervous because she said that someone could really use these glasses in particular!  Me, Mom!!!  Then they gave me back the collection and told me to get rid of them by next week so that others could benefit from them.  Whew!!!! </p><p> </p><p>I got rid of all the glasses except for my babies.  The lenses were really thick but they had like an old school cat style.  But I still couldn't see normally through them, and I had not seen clearly in weeks because I broke my friends glasses and she wouldn't let me have her sunglasses anymore.  Bitch.  Sorry but that is how I felt. </p><p> </p><p>As the day approached for my eye test I began to panic.  Wearing glasses was such a sexual thing for me that it would be embarassing to go to the eye doctor and explain why my eyes are so bad.  Mind you that I was still denying that I needed glasses to my parents, but they rearranged the furniture in the parlor so that the TV was now quite far away from the couch.  God, it was such a blur.  Yet I sat there pretending like I could see it with no problems.  I guess my parents expected this would force me to admit my bad eyesight.  Ha ha.  They would even say things like "Did you see that commercial?"  And I would say yes, but end up pulling ths sleepy act alot because I really couldn't make out much on the screen.  It gave me headaches and I felt dizzy trying to watch TV from that far away.

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2004, 15:15</p><p>After failing the eye test for my driver's license, I told my friend about it.  She said she already knew there was no way I could pass it.  Honestly I didn't know how bad my eyes were, but I was really becoming on wearing her prescription sunglasses to come out of the blur.  It felt like stepping through a door into another world, I mean here I could not recognize people and when I put on her glasses I could see the TV across the room.  And then I got the idea!  I could wear her regular glasses to the DMV and try to pass the test, then just give them back to her.  Nobody would even suspect I need glasses so badly.  My friend and I were walking home from school the next day when I told her this, but she aid it was time to come clean and admit how bad my eyes were.  I couldn't believe she was betraying me like that.  She gave me a story about how being around without her glasses gives her headaches and that's why she only let me use her sunglasses.  I told her that she was faking it and didn't believe it.  Well being immature, I told her she was being a bitch and that we were obviously not as close as I thought we were.  I grabbed her glasses from her face, and she screamed and started reaching for them,  so I started running down the  sidewalk but didn't see the post ahead of me being how blind I am.  I hit the pole with the force of my body and her glasses flew out of my hands and shattered on the sidewalk.  Oh crap.  I was in terrible pain and she couldn't see anything and was screaming at me.  I remember we didn't talk for a long long long long time after that.  To make matters worse, her parents told my parents that I stole her glasses and broke them because I wanted her glasses!  Oh double crap.  So I played it off like we were just horsing around, but my parents said they thought I acted like I need glasses sometimes.  I told them it was silly and I didn't need to wear glasses.  Then they did something I didn't expect.  My mother asked what I was doing with all these pairs of glasses in my clothes drawer, and who did I steal them from!  Why the hell do parents go through your things?  I was so angry, but then to really put the cherry on top, they said I was probably wearing them and since it would make my eyes bad, they made an eye doctor appointment for the following week and told me they were going with me.  Oh it gets better, but since there's enough interest I will end it here for now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2004, 14:07</p><p>Julie what is your prescription now and when you first needed specs?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2004, 10:40</p><p>Honestly I went so long needing glasses, it was a nightmare.  Back in those days, I simply could not find the guts to admit my eyesight was so strung out.  Like you say Puffin maybe my eyes just got bad on their own, but I thought that it was because I kept wearing strong glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Each year in school my eyesight just got worse.  I remember going into the cafeteria and trying to find my friends, but couldn't even see faces more than a few feet away.  In class it got very tough.  I tried so hard to see without squinting and even used techniques like holding my hands over my eyes like I was tired, but peaking through the smaller holes between my fingers.  That made the board much clearer.  But the strain on my eyes was so bad, I used to get alot of headaches and got really dizzy sometimes.  Sports were just terrible for me.  By the time my eyesight had really gotten bad, I had bowling in PE.  Do you know how hard it is to aim down the bowling alley when you can't see five feet away clearly? </p><p> </p><p>By the time I was a senior, everyone wanted to sign up for Drivers Ed, and so did I.  But I was petrified that I would be driving with my bad eyes.  When I sat in the passenger seat, I couldn't see signs at all and I didn't know what to do. </p><p> </p><p>I found a sneaky solution.  I found a  friend that wore glasses and discovered that she had sunglasses too.  I broke down and admitted to her how bad my eyes were, and she let me try her glasses on.  The entire world view came together.  All the blur disappeared and I could really see.  She let me wear her prescription sunglasses when I went driving in Driver's Ed, so that allowed me to put off getting glasses even longer!  Whew. </p><p> </p><p>But when I finally went to take the driver license test, things didn't go so hot.  I literally couldn't see anything in the machine, and I tried the lady behind the counter it was broken.  Right, she didn't believe me, and I ended up failing the test. </p><p> </p><p>There's more, but I think you need a break from all this rambling again.  :) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2004, 03:45</p><p>Maybe your eyes were just getting worse on their own without any help.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>oscar</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2004, 16:39</p><p>Hi Julie - that sounds like an interesting story. Please keep telling it :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2004, 16:32</p><p>I had a fairly unusual life.  I always thought it would be cool to wear glasses and always felt sort of a sexy thing for them, so I tried to make my eyes worse when I was young by wearing a spare pair of my father's glasses in the bathroom for as long as I could.  I am not sure if my parents started to suspect anything or not, but eventually my eyes stared to lose focus.  Perhaps it was because of the sexual attachment I had with glasses that made me feel embarassed to admit I needed them.  Here I wanted glasses, but then was afraid to let anyone know I needed them.  The world became more blurry to me with each passing year in school.  A few friends of mine used to pick on me and call me Blind Bat, but I would always deny it and say I just didn't see something because I was looking the other way, or I just played the ditzy blonde.  When the girls got into a glasses exchange, I would put them on and often see much better.  Eventually the school blackboards became too hard to see without squinting and I did not want to be discovered so I started acting sleepy and tired.  I used to find myself going to thrift stores to get stronger glasses to wear in private all the time to enhance the effects.  You know what, I am rambling here and there is much more to my story, but I don't know if anyone is interested or not.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2004, 14:17</p><p>Groetjes meisje - I'm well known to some here for my reluctance (like you) to be known as a glasses wearer. I think it's all about how much you think you need to see -I'm prepared to tolerate a bit more than some.  But I wear contact lenses much of the time and am happy to put up with less than perfect vision some of the time (although it can be uncomfortable). When I had conjunctivitis a few months ago though, I was prepared to wear my glasses simply because I knew there were times when I had no choice. I had a great reaction from my colleagues (who didn't see me in glasses EVER!!). The more you wear them, the more you'll notice the difference, and so you'll be better able to make the decision for yourself about how much you need to wear them - for comfort of course. But then again, many people just love glasses for the look they give them, be glad you can be part of that trend .... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Meisje </b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2004, 13:45</p><p>I think there are a lot women who are very shy to wear glasses. I mean, I'm one of them :). I do have glasses, but I only wear them at home, the cinema, around some friends, and when I'm riding home on my bike at night. I always say to myself I don't need them that bad, and that's true, I mean, I can see allright. It's just not entirely sharp. (I'm from Holland, so don't judge me for my language mistakes (how do you say that?) I don't know wat my exact prescription is but I thought: L -0,50 Cilinder -1,25 R Cilinder -2,25 (don't really know what it means, but it certainly is very annoying that everything near me is as blurry as everything far away, when i'm not wearing glasses of course) As a kid (from the age of 4 (now aged 18)) I did wear my glasses in public, but when I became a teenager I didn't want to because i thought it looked stupid (I had harry-potter-shape-like glasses far too big) and i didn't think it was necessary, until february this year and i got new glasses (very happy with them, only not happy enough to wear them all the time. too shy :)) </p><p>Oh, by the way, i've got a men in glasses thing.. how do you call that? I always look twice when a nice bespectacled guy catches my eye. </p><p> </p><p>I hope it wasn't boring, and if it was boring, I apologize :p, just felt like writing.  </p><p> </p><p>Meisje (means, Girl in dutch)  </p><p> </p><p>Oh, and Glasses in dutch are (wel IS actually. we don't call them a pair of.., but just a thing single object): een 'Bril' (doesn't sound charming at all, I like 'glasses' better)</p><p></p><hr>

I think this prism? i'm not sure, anyways we had to give oral presentations last night. When he got up to speak, he took off his specs, and he brought the paper up to his face about 3 inches or so. He was really having difficulty seeing. He was eyeballing it with one eye only. He was really struggling to focus. What condition does this sound like?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2004, 11:48</p><p>Very Curious: I think a lot of it is wishful thinking! I can only tell you about men, they're the ones I pay attention to. Nearsighted men who don't wear glasses either squint or fall over things, it's that simple. HOWEVER, virtually every man I find myself attracted to turns out to wear/need glasses. Can I spot it at a subconscious level, because I sure don't know what I'm seeing. One theory I came up with is that "bad" eyes are a certain shape, which I cannot describe or identify, but it just happens to be a shape of eyes that I'm attracted to. However my brother says that it's just the law of averages mixed with coincidence. Take your pick.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Very Curious</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2004, 06:52</p><p>Seems like alot of the people in this forum are able to spot a woman who needs glasses pretty easily.  Apart from the obvious squinting, I am wondering if there are other telltale signs that give away the fact they are nearsighted?  Do their eyes look a certain way?  Is it possible to tell if someone has glasses but isn't wearing them, or has never worn glasses and deseparately needs them?  How do you tell?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phoropter</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2004, 11:27</p><p>Plus Crazy: "In my country (Sri Lanka) no hyperopic youths at all!" NO Way! I am in full agreement with Curt.  I can almost guarantee anyone under 10 years old without glasses has a small amount to hyperopia.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2004, 06:55</p><p>Plus Crazy: What you are saying may not be entirely true.  Young people with low to moderate amounts of hyperopia can often get by without wearing glasses due to extra accomodation that they have.  You will not usually see a young person wearing +1 or +2 lenses.  It is only in cases of high hyperopia that they would need glasses to see clearly.  And often with high hyperopia, folks are self-conscious about the degree of magnification that glasses give their eyes (the "bug-eyed" look) and would likely wear contact lenses if they were able.  Also, if they do wear low + specs, they may only need them for reading and would not likely wear them out in public. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

I suppose the good people here though have alread done that and didn't come up with good ideas for what to use the space up for. My posting below was just to get something out. Sightings seems to deal with specs on plus other attractions, ie, fame, other physical features. Oh well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2003, 12:03</p><p>Bob W, this was a vanity thread for a user who has since retired from posting for personal reasons and asked that the content be deleted. So all we are left with is an enigmatic title and a lot of space to post.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob W</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2003, 11:51</p><p>Wurm, what's this thread for? Maybe not so "hot" sightings. I was reading through the archives ( I'm a speed reader ) and came across Caitlin and Susanne DK. In their memory: Scene - shopping mall food gallery ( US ) enter 2 women dressed in full length, very bright yellow rain slickers, both wearing Rx sunglasses, myopic. They split up, going to different stalls and order. As soon as they order from the wall menu, off go the glasses. The older shoves hers in her hair, the younger, somewhere unseen. I caught a glance as they arrived, the younger seemed to have about -4? Rx, the older much stronger. I'm can't claim much experience/accurracy with Rx. They cautiously approach each other, and at about 50 feet 1 appears to call out the other's name, and then agree to a table. The younger woman gets her food first, then the older. After lunch, the set out, both bare eyed. I can't resist. This is dastardly on my part. I just hope one of them doesn't whip out their glasses and I'm toast. I get behind them on the escelator to the lower level. The older woman's glasses are incredibly strong. My ex was -8 or 9 and -12, and this woman was stronger, and she was clearly the leader of this party. they entered a movie memorobilia shop. I stayed out. I saw them both with their noses very close to an item of interest. I couldn't just stand outside gawking. This was just absolutely outrageous behavior on my part. I entered the shop. The younger one asks the older one where something is, and she points off in a general direction across the shop. The magical spell is broken when the older one slips her glasses down to look at something being projected on a wall sized screen. She then whirls around to see me gawking, and I whirl aroung to hastily exit!!!</p><p></p><hr>
