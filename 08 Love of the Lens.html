<p><b></b>&nbsp;23 Dec 2012, 08:33</p><p>astar, if puffun's statement is correct, why would you insist on someone wearing glasses?  why do you need to be in control?  think about that.  i would hope that you are not giving faulty advice in order to advance your fetishistic sexual desires.  the decision about wearing glasses full time should be up to the individual's own personal needs and desires, not yours.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2012, 18:39</p><p>Astra </p><p> </p><p>that is not necessarily true. Simply put, there are various reactions from the visual system to fuzzy vision. Some are attempts to adapt. Sometimes adaption is not enough. A little care is needed in blanket diagosis when the full facts are not known or obvious.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GL</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2012, 03:49</p><p>Really thick high minus lenses are a real turn on. I love all the white rings, the refraction through the lenses and how they make everything look small. So hot.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>raybanz</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2011, 15:02</p><p>Filthy McNasty: that's an interesting theory, but doesn't the imposition of a logo somewhat compromise the optical quality of the lens (albeit in one place)?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;09 May 2011, 03:19</p><p>P.S.

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;09 May 2011, 03:18</p><p>I can also personally recommend Eye2Eye Optical. I have used them countless times for reglazing glasses and they've always produced top results. </p><p> </p><p>For examples of their work see my Photostream on Flickr and look at the -9.75 Tura and Vogue glasses, and the -9.5 Gucci and Dior frames as well as the Prada -8's. </p><p> </p><p>Single vision - they used to classify this as -8, but they've recently changed it -6 :( - is Â£20 inc p&amp;p;, anything I think up to -10 is Â£25 inc p&amp;p; although they've done my last few reglazes with Â£5 knocked off as I've referred a few people and regularly glasses done by them. </p><p> </p><p>They have no website but can either be found eBay by the username "eye2eye04" (I think), or the following; </p><p> </p><p>eye2eye04@gmail.com</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Smudgeur</b>&nbsp;08 May 2011, 08:43</p><p>I can recommend UK-based Ciliary Blue for reglazing, they did a superb job on some varifocal sunglasses for my wife.

<p><b>EyeTri</b>&nbsp;08 May 2011, 04:03</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p>I checked their site, and for CR-39 lenses within the prescription range of +1.00 to -4.00 the price is $30.00 per pair. For a pair of CR-39 lenses within the prescription range of +4.00 to -8.00 the price is $40.00. I didn't see a price for AR.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 May 2011, 02:33</p><p>Rachel </p><p>I just went into that one and put in a prescription for mild short sightness with a small astigmatism. But by the time you put everything onto the lenses it added up to $56.33 not including the shipping. I guess that is not bad if you are creating your own desired rx. My friend at Sam's even though we have been good friends for many years will only go by the book. Meaning I must give her a real rx script sheet. At least this place sounds like you can indeed make up your rx as you wish.  </p><p>For the time being with still trying to find what your eyes will tolerate I would suggest staying with on-line glasses as that will be the cheapest option for you. After you find what rx you want as your glasses for a long period then is when you should consider buying from e-bay and replacing the lenses.  </p><p>Right now it seems you are not sure if you can just start wearing minus glasses without the aid of plus contacts or if you decide to find the combination so you can wear the -5.50 glasses you have on order now. </p><p>I was and still am hoping to find someone that can do lens replacement for not more than $30.00 including AR coat. Because I would still have the shipping cost to ship it to whoever does it. What I am hoping for may not exist?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;07 May 2011, 19:08</p><p>Soundman - it says here </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132720/http://www.selectspecs.com/reglaze/" target="_blank">http://www.selectspecs.com/reglaze/</a> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 May 2011, 18:24</p><p>Eye-Tri  </p><p>Any idea what they charge to change single vision lenses out? Include AR coating as well. That is something I have come up against a few times where someone has a very expensive frame and they only what that lenses made stronger. One girl seems to somehow come up with brand new "BeBe" frames often and wants her rx put into them. So for the best deal I could get was from a friend at Sam's Warehouse for $60.00 including the AR. The good news is it took less than a week to get her the glasses back. </p><p>Your help would be appreciated. Again thanks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>varifocals</b>&nbsp;07 May 2011, 11:19</p><p>I do the same with Select Specs based in Ramsgate.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>EyeTri</b>&nbsp;07 May 2011, 11:13</p><p>Rachel, </p><p>If you find a frame that you like, buy it. It's not that big a deal to have lenses changed. I currently having lenses changed by www.eyeglasslensdirect.com .They do a good job at a reasonable price and they just ask for your prescription and PD ( no eye doc info).  </p><p> </p><p>There are other places that do this. Just google "eyeglass lens replacement".</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;07 May 2011, 06:19</p><p>Gwgs: </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for the offer but i'll hold off for now and see what I can find on ebay.  </p><p> </p><p>Soundmanpt: </p><p> </p><p>As for the lenses, I wasn't really thinking about how/if i'd get them changed but agree it would probably be a lot of hassle. </p><p> </p><p>As for the frame/lens width I agree that its good to know total width, but the reason I said about the lens width is twofold: One I like wide lenses that come out to the edge of my face and second I have a narrow pd and zenni wouldn't accomodate it in some frames with lens width &gt;52. why is this?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 May 2011, 12:37</p><p>gwgs - actually the best number to use is the overall width if it has one. Sadly many frames are stated as 53 or 54 etc. so it make it hard to figure the total size. I don't think the temple length is a good one to use. Temples can easily be adjusted to fit behind the ears. I tell people shopping on line to find a pair of glasses that fit very well and measure across the face from the outside left to the outside right and then compare that way, but if they only give the lens size that does no good. Also of course only having the lens size does not account for the bridge size either. Also a plastic frame itself will be bigger than say a wire frame.  </p><p>I have noticed that some on-line retailers only show the lens size, I don't won't ever use them. Most do show the full overall width and that is good.  </p><p>In this case rachel may find it difficult or impossible to find a local shop that will put in whatever rx she may want. There are a few on-line places she might use that will reglaze for her with her desired rx Most are not very cheap.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;06 May 2011, 11:11</p><p>Hi Rachel </p><p> </p><p>Why not try some 53 wide frames on in your local optician, then you can see how these are. I always tend to go by the temple length (the last measurement and not the frame measurement). However, as I'm not wearing them I suppose this is why I'm not that bothered!! </p><p> </p><p>You can set up an email alert with eBay where it will email you when new items are added. You should type in "Monsoon" in the "Health &amp; Beauty &gt; Glasses" category and then select "save this search". You need to be logged in to do this. eBay will then email you these results for 6 months and will take the hassle out of searching for you. </p><p> </p><p>How much would you be interested in paying for a pair out of interest as if it's a decent amount I'd happily sell these to you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;06 May 2011, 09:24</p><p>gwgs: </p><p> </p><p>Thanks, I thought so and they are the same as the ebay ones just a different colour. I'll have to keep checking ebay. Just googling the frames doesn't come up with anything. </p><p>That fit is perfect for me (I think, although do you think that 53 is too wide since I have a pd of 58 but a rather wide face - my eyes are a little too close together!). My current glasses are 51, 19, 140. Bridge 18 would be even better. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;06 May 2011, 09:16</p><p>Rachel, the details of the Monsoon frames are as follows; </p><p> </p><p>53 18 140 Monsoon Lupin 24813778  </p><p> </p><p>Specsavers is written on the other arm (I think you already knew this though!) </p><p> </p><p>Hope this helps!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;06 May 2011, 08:35</p><p>Hi Rachel </p><p> </p><p>Will get the measurements, and the model number and post on here.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;06 May 2011, 07:01</p><p>Hey gwgs: Thanks  - I can find somewhere to hide my things i'm sure, but still need to get the contacts before I can really go for it. That's the sticking point. </p><p>Re the monsoon frames - measurements would be great. I've looked on ebay and spotted these </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132720/http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/Designer-MONSOON-Lupin-Glasses-GREEN-Specsavers-Ladies-/370506470524?pt=UK_Health_Beauty_VisionGlasses_Lenses_SM&amp;hash=item5643e8147c" target="_blank">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/Designer-MONSOON-Lupin-Glasses-GREEN-Specsavers-Ladies-/370506470524?pt=UK_Health_Beauty_VisionGlasses_Lenses_SM&amp;hash;=item5643e8147c</a> </p><p> </p><p>which I think are the same glasses but in green. Not the colour I like but I wonder if I might put a bid in. Pity the vendor doesn't know the Rx. If I could get hold of the red/brown ones i'd really considered getting them reglazed to an Rx I can wear as I love semi-rimless trendy frames like that. There aren't many new ones about like that now, I don't think Specsavers stock anything like it anymore. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;06 May 2011, 05:45</p><p>P.S. With your GOC 'tools', could you not hide them in your car (if you have one), or do you a desk at work you could put them in a drawer there? Otherwise put them in shoe box or something similar and push them to back your wardrobe or similar space that has storage above it!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;06 May 2011, 05:43</p><p>Hi Rachel, the Prada's were always a frame I wanted to get hold of as I've so many women wearing them I was keen to add this frame to my collection, but when I received it I was suprised how short the temples are, I haven't got an extra big head (!!), nor has my missus yet we both struggle to get the temples to fit properly over our ears like all other frames! </p><p> </p><p>Two more photos of the Monsoon frame have been posted. If you want measurements of this frame please let me know and I'll note them next time I'm at home</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 17:33</p><p>socks@  Thanks, i've looked over the GOC thread and it's all good except I need to get a contact lens fitting....and i'm not brave enough to pretend I want coloured lenses and I also am worried about my husband finding the lenses (and the glasses for that matter - got to figure out what to do with them!) </p><p> </p><p>gwgs@  Love your collection too. My favourites are the Prada, Monsoon and KH rimless. I always wanted to try out rimless specs but have failed since they always seem to have wide bridges - 19-20mm and they literally slip off my face and look stupid. Wondered if you had a front on pic of the Monsoon ones you can post/send? Would love to try something like that on, think would suit me. </p><p>As for wearing my -5.5's I had just planned to play around a little when my husband is out, don't expect i'll be able to see a thing though. May have more luck with the -1.5's.  </p><p> </p><p>I want to find out what is the max level of minus I could comfortably accommodate with my hyperopic tendencies. Guess I wouldn't be safe to drive with even weakish lenses. </p><p>As above, would love to do GOC in private or out where no one knows me but just don't know how....and no i'm not going to tell my hubby, at least not for the forseeable future as I am pretty sure he'd freak out and think he'd married a crazy woman!! What are others experiences of telling their partners? Although he's a full time glasses wearer and doesn't have any kind of vanity issue, he just sees glasses as a tool to function properly! But nice for me to look at all the same. </p><p> </p><p>Smudgear@  Chat away - or email is sleepysheepy@rocketmail.com </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 06:20</p><p>gwgs @ thanks! My email address is rob.ahoewa@gmail.com </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 04:55</p><p>Crystal Veil - thanks! This is only part of the collection, probably about 1/2!! In the past she I have managed to "steal" a few photos of her wearing glasses, i.e. not posed for, and some would be xxx rated!  </p><p> </p><p>I have quite a few pairs which are surplus to requirements (old stock which I'm not keen on anymore, or the photos on the ebay listings didn't match up with my expections/perceptions) and relist them on eBay, but after hearing that Smudgeur sent you a few pairs of glasses, if they don't sell I'd be glad to send them over to you if they are of any use. What's your email address and I'll get in touch to get your mailing address to send them over to you. </p><p> </p><p>I would love to do a photoshoot and had mentioned this a couple of times. I had suggested she can get dressed up, apply her makeup etc and we'll do a proper shoot but it's never happened, and she is extremely stern with regard to me not publishing the photos and there is therefore no point in doing this. She also has a bee in her bonnet that I hover around on sites like this which if she found out I did she had my proverbials tied around my neck!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 04:32</p><p>gwgs and smudgeur @ </p><p> </p><p>gwgs: you have built up a wonderful collection. Hat off! It would be even greater if your girlfriend would pose in them. Have you ever considered doing and posting a photo shoot with her or with other models? </p><p> </p><p>smudgeur: I am still grateful for your donation of 20 pairs last year!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 03:58</p><p>Smudgeur, some of similarities between you and I are remarkable, although its more than likely a common trait with us glasses/girls with glasses lovers. </p><p> </p><p>I have also built up rather a large collection, almost by accident as when I told my girlfriend of my love for all things glasses related several years ago she told me to feel free to buy as many pairs as I liked and she would happily model them. I don't think she realised what she was letting herself in for as I probably have at least 50 pairs of glasses now, in varying prescriptions (unfortunately for me she doesn't require glasses :) ) </p><p> </p><p>I've uploaded a series of photos onto Flickr for people to browse through. </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132720/http://www.flickr.com/photos/girlswithglassesphotos/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/girlswithglassesphotos/</a> </p><p> </p><p>Rachel - how are you going to wear your minus 5.5's with your husband knowing you don't need these? Are you going to tell him, or do GOC/wear them and try to accommodate your vision when he's not around?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Smudgeur</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 03:35</p><p>Hi Rachel </p><p> </p><p>I totally understand where you're coming from. Until I discovered this site a few years ago I thought I was the only one too! </p><p> </p><p>I've ordered all kinds of frames for myself and have developed a collectors fetish, ordering secondhand pairs off eBay (I gave a lot of my collection to Crystal Veil last year, but still have quite a lot). </p><p> </p><p>My wife has a similar prescription to you, but I came clean with her a few years ago and she wears hers all the time too to indulge me! </p><p> </p><p>Would love to chat more, I'm in the UK too (Essex).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Socks</b>&nbsp;04 May 2011, 20:18</p><p>If you go the glasses over contacts thread, there is lots of good advice.  I do GOC pretty regularly.  Like you, my own wife thinks my real RX is much stronger than it really is becasue she doesn't know I wear thicker glasses than I really need or that I'm often doing GOC.  I love to talk about glasses with her too and how much I think I need thicker ones, etc.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;04 May 2011, 17:24</p><p>It looks like I have picked a really old thread to pick up! </p><p> </p><p>I'm new to Eyescene and have posted a little on online retailers. What a cool site! </p><p> </p><p>I really want to be able to wear minus glasses but i'm from a hyperopic family through and through and my current Rx is a pathetic +1 and -0.5 cyl both eyes. I can see good without the glasses but do get headaches all the time, I assume from the slight astigmatism and doing a lot of close work so I like to wear these glasses almost all of the time because I like wearing glasses but i'd like to really NEED them and preferably be nearsighted instead. I fantasise all the time about this and have done since I was about 16. </p><p> </p><p>Because I wear my glasses a lot most of my friends (who know nothing about lenses to see how weak they are) think I do really need them, as does my husband. On the rare occasion anyone has questioned me about my vision and glasses I just say i've got quite a lot of astigmatism and therefore its more comfortable to wear all the time. If I meet anyone wearing glasses i'm immediately drawm to them and try to figure out their Rx. </p><p> </p><p>Can't change my genes I know but i'm hoping i'm young enough to perhaps wear weak minus lenses at least sometimes. I've also just ordered some -1.5's and -5.5's from zenni just for fun. But my husband doesn't know anything of my obsession, or how I gaze through his minus lenses all the time wishing I was like him. Its about the only thing i've ever kept a secret from him, though he must suspect something since I bring up the subject of glasses all the time. On the other hand he probably has no clue since wearing glasses to him is just one of life's annoyances. I'd like to do GOC, even just in private but don't know how to legitimately get a contacts fitting to find out my size.  </p><p> </p><p>Would love to hear from anyone who knows what any of this is like and get a chat going.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2009, 00:47</p><p>Dieter </p><p> </p><p>One thing about plus lenses I love is the magnification of the eyes, very high minus lenses (-15/-25) when the eyes appear so small doesn't do it for me - expect maybe Sandra who is a lovely girl! </p><p> </p><p>The other thing is when standing behind someone, plus lens give strange distorted images which is quite at odds with actually putting them on and being able to see fairly clearly. Myope lenses images always appear clear but just smaller according to the strength. </p><p> </p><p>On balance I prefer a moderate plus but still like all lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2009, 14:59</p><p>Katy, </p><p> </p><p>I had an incredibly strong attraction to females wearing glasses, wearing contacts, or needing correction.  I wasnt particularly concerned with the strength or dependency, just the fact that their vision was less than perfect.  Sometimes less dependence seemed preferable because those girls would tend to play with their glasses more since they didnt require them as much to see.  Seeing a girl squint or hearing a discussion about visual inabilities was fantastic.  But my fear of needing glasses or having visual inabilities was epic.  Still, I envied everyone (male and female) that wore glasses especially the ones that looked desirable.  I remember being at a sporting event with my best friend who tried on another friends glasses after stating he couldnt see certain details.  Looking pleased, he simply declared that he needed to get some of these and continued wearing the glasses for a bit longer.  I would never have been able to even try them on in a public place like that!  Within weeks my friend was wearing his own glasses full time and looked great.  Soon I noticed that some girls found him to be very attractive.  I wanted so badly to be like him. </p><p> </p><p>Many years later, at ages 19-24, when I started wearing glasses, I would catch ladies doing head turns, double takes and sneaking looks.  I knew they either liked what they saw or wanted to like what they saw.  It made me feel incredibly sexy.  But I still felt damaged and inferior especially around other men.  I often wonder what might have been had I resolved my fears earlier.  Even better, what might have been had I been forced to accept that fate at a young age when I first began to notice the girls with glasses?  Would it have been possible to engage in more personal contact had I had more shared experiences with GWGs?  It could have been thrilling to console and encourage new members of the club, discuss their feelings, and share at glasses exchanges.  I wish I had the chance to do it differently. </p><p> </p><p>As Aubrac said so well, Sorry for wittering on a bit!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2009, 12:58</p><p>Aubrac, </p><p> </p><p>First let me say that Im sorry for suggesting that one should never apologize.  Wait . . . . .   </p><p> </p><p>I had little interest in plus lenses until recent years.  I now find them equally attractive and perhaps even more intriguing since what I learn about them seems new.  Changes to my own eyesight have allowed me to gain more insight as to the uncomfortable strain and sensations of feeling hyperopic.  It also seems that plus lenses have had remarkable advances.  I dont know if it is improvements in aspheric lenses, high-index materials, or a combination of many qualities, but modern plus lenses seem to have a look that is very sensual to me. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2009, 09:23</p><p>ehpc - yes, it is always myself I imagine in those situations. It's not just women that get turned on by that kind of thing (see Rayray &amp; sourgrapes!). I know a few men who are into BDSM and they are very much the submissive ones - being humiliated or being forced into things is a big part of that. Surely a lot of the men here who are doing GOC or inducing myopia are getting turned on by that too.. although I know for some it is more to do with seeing yourself as a myopic person without the myopia and trying to put that right. </p><p> </p><p>Phil - I never even got to try anyone's glasses on at school, I was too terrified even to do that. I remember people passing glasses round and everyone trying them on - I used to run away!! Ha ha now that is really being scared of wearing glasses! :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2009, 01:41</p><p>Katy, </p><p>My "thing" for glasses started with the onset of puberty. I heard that a (male) cousin of mine who lived near London (I lived in Wales) had been prescribed glasses. I felt an incredible sense of envy, though I knew that, as much as I wanted glasses, it would never be easy for me to appear publicly in them. Then one or two schoolfriends got prescribed low minus glasses and when, as schoolboys do, I tried them on I felt so aroused. My father had a few old pairs around the house and whenever my parents were out I would try them on and get a tremendous "kick" from doing so. </p><p>I cannot recall when I was first attracted to a gwg; but I can recall a girl called Cherry who had quite significant minus lenses and travelled on my bus. I often dreamt of her as I lay in bed. As time went by, glasses on my male friends became less significant to me but my interest in girls with minus glasses became greater and greater. It was really a golden age as many girls at school acquired their first specs. I remember 2 or 3 girls in the school choir who started to put them on to see the conductor clearly. And I can recall an attractive but overweight girl appearing at a reehearsal for the school play, hot-foot from the opticians with a lovely first pair of low minus lenses in black frames and a huge specs case. </p><p>I wanted glasses mysaelf but I was too scared to get them (though by my late teens I needed them). I think my ambivalence was triggered by the significance they now had in my life. </p><p>Sorry to bore.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rayray</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2009, 17:05</p><p>Katy, despite being male my experience is very similar to yours. As an adolescent, I was both frightened of and very resistant to wearing glasses. I at the same time developed a strong sexual attraction for women wearing glasses and fantasised about lady opticians wearing strong minus glasses making me wear strong minus glasses too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;07 Nov 2009, 09:43</p><p>Katy's fantasy about being 'forced' to wear glasses, or 'forced' to wear strong minus glasses, is interesting on another, more general, level too. It seems to me (although the militant feminists would quickly go into denial-overdrive at this suggestion) that a very important part of female sexuality, in fantasy and indeed frequently(though not always) in reality too, is this whole thing of being 'forced' to do certain activites - this is all tied in, of course, to this whole female sedxual concept of longing for complete submission and 'surrender' to the masculine sexual desires of their desired man.There is a certain aspect of feamale sexuality which delights in complete masculine domination of this type - being tied up, for example, where the woman may only be freed by the man's consent. With glasses, this might take the form of being sexually delighted by their man 'stealing' their glasses(especially if the glasses are very strong minus) so that the woman is utterly dependent on the man giving them back - at a time of his choosing, and only if she pleases him. Militant feminist outrage may choose to deny this, but I know it's there :) It's all the Princess in the Tower (note the phallic symbolism of the 'tower' at which the Princess is at the top)  being rescued by her gallant knight syndrome etc etc etc Pete</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sourgrapes</b>&nbsp;07 Nov 2009, 08:35</p><p>Both ways for me -- wearing glasses myself, and the appeal in attractive woman wearing glasses</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;07 Nov 2009, 08:18</p><p>Katy - that is an interesting fetish you have about being' forced' to wear glasses, being 'forced' to wear very strong minus glasses etc. This sounds very hot. I take it the fantasy concerns YOURSELF in these situations? Which leads me on to something I have often realsised in terms of glasses, that for women - and only women - a strong sexual component of the glasses-fetish sexuality is WEARING GLASSES THEMSELVES - whereas for a heterosexual man the appeal is solely in the attractive woman wearing glasses. It would be fascinating to hear from female correspondents about how their fantasies OF BEING GWG THEMSELVES play into their sexuality. </p><p> </p><p>Pete                 </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;07 Nov 2009, 03:48</p><p>When i first got glasses i loved the clarity i'd never known before. Since then i've experienced the same feeling with every increase i've been given and now i really look forwards to them. i've also learned to love the way my lenses look in my glasses and the feel of the curves whenever i clean them. this obviously leads to me wanting stronger prescriptions all the time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;07 Nov 2009, 03:29</p><p>Dieter - I was also terrified of having to get glasses when I was younger, and then later began to have fantasies about that. I think for me, as well as the fear of disability, it was the fear of humiliation - of having to walk into school with glasses on, of everyone looking and making comments. Even now, years after I went full time, the biggest turn-ons for me are fantasies about being forced to wear glasses, having to get really strong plus or minus glasses, etc etc. I'm sure my glasses fetish stems from that initial fear. In terms of the opposite sex, I think it was a feeling of admiration for boys with glasses that attracted me to them in the first place - the fact that they had overcome my biggest fear, and were happily going around with glasses on, something I thought I could never do. The attraction to the 'vulnerability' aspect of it came later. </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if this fear of having to get glasses played a role for other people? Aubrac, it sounds like maybe it did for you.. Phil too? </p><p> </p><p>Nova man, from what you are saying it sounds like it is the 'accessory' aspect of glasses that is important to you.. that's what I mean about similarity to eg. a shoe fetish - people talk about things like the way the shoes fit, the straps/buckles, licking them etc. VFL, you are describing the other aspect perfectly - the attraction to vulnerability, which is how I feel. Like you say, the contrast between the fact that a man is strong, successful etc and the fact that he has this 'weakness' makes him even more irresistible. I remember someone (Tinyeyes?) talking about a guy at the gym who was a good example of that - very fit, strong and attractive, but made vulnerable by his dependence on strong glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Like Lenses</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2009, 20:09</p><p>VFL </p><p> Then you would like me in my - 4.50 glasses. I wear them as an overcorrection in place of my prescribed - 3.50 which  I need full time as  I have induced this myopia.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2009, 12:56</p><p>As erotically charged as eyeglasses can be for me, the physical glasses themselves leave me cold.  They have to be on the man or in his possession.  Lying on the nightstand waiting to be reached for and put on they become charged, but it is the act of using and needing the glasses that turns me on. </p><p> </p><p>The vulnerability of a man who really needs his glasses unlocks something in me. A strong, successful, handsome guy who has to depend on little lenses for clear sight can stop my heart, cloud my thinking and bring me to my knees.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2009, 08:29</p><p>Dieter </p><p> </p><p>I have always been a minus lover with little or no interest, apart from mild curiosity, towards plus glasses. </p><p> </p><p>However with the advent of my wife being prescribed plus glasses several years ago, I have now been converted to more of a plus than minus lover. </p><p> </p><p>I wouldn't agree that apologising is a sign of weakness but this is a matter for discussion on another thread.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2009, 06:22</p><p>Aubrac, </p><p> </p><p>Do you experience a different sensation of attraction towards plus (current wife) and minus (first wife) lenses? </p><p> </p><p>By the way, never apologize, it shows weakness.  Unless, of course, youre trying to get laid, then all bets are off ;-) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2009, 01:11</p><p>Is one turned onby the impairment or by the glasses per se. A very difficult one to answer because it is probably different for every person. Glasses, hearing aid, prosthetic, etc, show people as being more vulnerable and therefore bring out a protective instinct. This may also blend with a repressed desire with sexual overtones and once this gratification has been felt, it is fuelled by further sightings and the use of glasses as 'toys'. </p><p> </p><p>Don't get me wrong, as a lifetime GWG lover I have always loved the lens but still try to understand actually why. </p><p> </p><p>My first memory of glasses was when my sister aged 13 came back from an eyetest and was told she needed glasses. The whole family was in uproar and everyone was covering one eye and trying to read newspaper headlines from across the room, accompanied by comments like 'No one in our family has ever needed glasses, where has it come from'. </p><p> </p><p>No doubt this sowed a seed of doubt about glasses wearing in my 8 year old brain, and made me a reluctant glasses wearer and FT contacts wearer when my turn came. </p><p> </p><p>The initial attraction to my first wife was her glasses, -3.5 with a lot of cylinder and some prism correction, quite thick lenses in a gold aviator style frame. I remember often wearing her prescription sunglasses when not in contacts. Alas love of the lens was not enough to keep us together after a few years. </p><p> </p><p>When I met my present wife I was immediately attracted to her for many physical and personal reasons although she didn't wear glasses. When she was prescribed glasses the sudden turn-on of this did threaten for a while to eclipse the previous attractions. I think now after six years of glasses wearing and as she edges towards FT wear, I have got this aspect of our relationship into perspective. </p><p> </p><p>Sorry for wittering on a bit!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nova man</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2009, 16:40</p><p>For me I cant really say I am attracted to the imparement or helplessness part of this I am turned on by the way they sit on the wearers face or if they are slight ly crooked or bent or how they are behind the ears. I like to touch the lenses and feel ther smoothe ness. and when I was able to share that with my ex wife it becme that much more intense  using her glasses to touch all parts of her body rubbing her back with the frames and ear pieces. fogging them up . or just walking up to her and for no reason licking the lenses and watching her clean them, or licking the nose pads. laying in bed and running my fingers behind her ears and across the lenses . I wont go into detail about the intimate stuff but use your imagination. What bothers me is people label me a freak or weirdo for this but its ok for people to like long legs, or boobs, or butts or different colored eyes or hair. Just hearing the sound of her taking them off and settign them on the counter before getting in the shower only those that know these geelings know where I am coming from. I pray to god I find a woman who shares these feelings and would love to be in a "glasses" relaionshiop. Time will tell</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2009, 14:11</p><p>Pete, </p><p> </p><p>Perfectly and succinctly stated. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2009, 14:04</p><p>Katy, </p><p> </p><p>I greatly appreciate your vast insight. One thing this forum has taught me over the years is that everyone has very different feelings, tastes, vulnerabilities, and the f words  fetishes and fantasies. I have to agree that you are absolutely correct in your assessment of the creepy scale and I would add that even the victims would view their attractiveness in differing ways. Some would understand and enjoy their popularity while others wouldnt and for all of the same reasons you stated.  Ive come to realize in recent years that my fantasies even changed over time. As a youngster, I strictly appreciated seeing the female form wearing glasses. That occurred prior to me being aware of the form of the female. Yet, I completely feared the possibility of that happening to me but I now know it was my fear of disability. I retained that fear well after knowing I had become myopic, it was advancing, and there was no hope for reversal. </p><p> </p><p>Not long after recognizing my fetish for GWGs, I began to develop an interest in and then later fantasies of their dependence. Eventually, the fantasies began to include thoughts of my own impairment and dependence, thoughts of the enhancement of my appearance when wearing glasses especially to females, and thoughts of how it would feel to use glasses to see. The fantasies progressed even though I still was positively scared to be dependent or be seen wearing glasses. </p><p> </p><p>My fear subsided easily once I surrendered to full time wear and accepted dependence. Almost immediately I realized that I was no more handicapped than a person who felt too tall, too short, too slow, or too big. Since then, Ive never considered wearing glasses or contact lenses to be impairment in any way at least as long as the individuals vision was restored to nearly 20/20 as most are. I wish society as a whole wouldnt either but I know you are correct. I personally find a lust for true visual impairment as creepy but I feel the same of fetishes for wheel chairs, braces, etc.  I dont intend to be judgmental of others but impairment definitely is not my thing. </p><p> </p><p>I find the wearing of glasses to show an acceptance of an unimportant physical imperfection of which everyone possesses several. It shows maturity to correct the imperfection so easily. It is sexy to use that imperfection as an asset by flaunting it as fashion to improve attractiveness. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2009, 13:57</p><p>ehpc, I agree with you completely. That sort of woman is very appealing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2009, 10:59</p><p>Just to clarify - GWGS are a turn-on for me because they express confidence,'I've got my head together' mindset,intelligence, and 'look at me - I wear glasses and don't I look just great? :)' Glasses to me signify a 'sorted', bright, intelligent,'head-together', accomplished, and confident woman. </p><p>Pete </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2009, 08:24</p><p>Dieter, sorry for taking ages to reply to that, I've been away. I think most people would agree with you about the importance of the person being attractive to begin with, but for me the glasses affect my perception of that - someone that I wouldn't otherwise look twice at can become fascinating to me because of his glasses. I once had a huge crush on a guy that was much older than me and really not attractive in any way, apart from his glasses which must have been about -10. Yes, I have it bad!  </p><p> </p><p>I think maybe a girl would be a little freaked out if she found her photo on a red hair fetish site if it was, like this site, discussing sightings, fantasies etc. But the glasses thing is probably seen as creepier because it is attraction to 'impairment' of some kind - attraction to something that traditionally has been seen as unattractive or a 'fault'. In this sense it is similar to hearing aid/wheelchair fetishes which are also viewed as creepy or weird. But I think maybe the glasses thing operates on two different levels - glasses as an 'aid' and glasses as an accessory. I think ehpc has said that it is purely the 'accessory' thing for him, and I agree that this is comparable to something like a shoe fetish. So in terms of creepiness, at one end of the scale you could have a slight preference for girls/men with glasses (socially acceptable), in the middle you have a fetish for glasses as an accessory, and at the other extreme, you get turned on by the whole helplessness/vulnerability/high rx thing (socially unacceptable). </p><p> </p><p>Nova man &amp; Phil, you both have it as bad as me! :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2009, 12:28</p><p>Katy, </p><p> </p><p>Wow, you, Phil, and others got it bad!  (Not that there is anything wrong with that ;-)  Let me restate, if it was nothing but a fetish, then I would never get past the glasses.  And thats not completely true.  Obviously, glasses are the first thing that catches my attention.  Granted, it is a stronger pull than should be reasonable.  But once past that, I begin to notice the eyes that are looking through the lenses.  Is their color unusual?  Are they bright and clear?  And yes, it is especially exciting if those lenses seem complex.  I notice the ears and nose attached to the frames especially when the fit looks right.  Do the ear pieces look feminine?  Or are they chewed up with bite marks?  Do the frames enhance her face?  Then I see her neck, hands and arms. I see her shape.  I see her legs.  I see her shoes and maybe her feet if shes wearing sandals.  I notice the proportion of her body.  While all of that is going on, Ive begun assessing her personality.  If we seem compatible we go forward.  If not, well, she was nice to stare at for a few moments.  But no way would I lust after someone wearing glasses that seemed unattractive to me. </p><p> </p><p>I sure didnt mean to imply that a fetish or being a little kinky was a bad thing.  I just get tired of all of us being treated (and treating ourselves) as weird because we notice and like glasses.  Have you ever noticed the girls that reference our site with awe and disgust?  My photo was used on a kinky site that was all about glasses fetishes!  I told those disgusting creeps to remove it at once.  She wouldnt freak at all if the reference was to her red hair, short skirt, long legs, or 5-inch heels.  Those features can be fetishes, too, but they seem to be within acceptable social norms.  Why? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2009, 02:40</p><p>Katy, you are right! I can like a girl with long hair. Then the next day I see one with short hair and admire her too! But my "preference" for a gwg is so much stronger. Whenever I dream of a woman she's in glasses; and day dreaming about a girl getting her first specs, or an eyetest leading to an increased rx, has a more profound effect on me than any other dream. A fetish is more than a preference; it is, as you say, capable of making one lose reason. And giving into it is not entirely a matter of choice. Because it verges on obsession it is far move pervasive in one's life.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2009, 15:08</p><p>Dieter - do you go on websites that discuss tall socks or high heels? Do you write stories about these things? I think there is a difference for most of us here between our preferences, which everyone has, and a glasses fetish which is the reason most of us are here. I don't think there's anything wrong or negative about the word 'fetish' or 'kinky' but your post makes it sound like you do. I think if we are regularly checking this site, reading glasses fiction, fantasising about / looking at photos of people with glasses etc etc, then most of us have a glasses fetish. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2009, 14:09</p><p>Pete, </p><p> </p><p>My wife of over 3 decades still thinks she's "bothering" me.  Helloooo.  I'm male.   </p><p> </p><p>I agree and I think it goes both ways.  Both sexes can appreciate being ogled to some extent if it is not over the top.  I like Melyssas suggestion.  Ive never had someone be that forward with their eyewear but I for one would appreciate that.  It doesnt have to come off as a kinky thing, either.  To me it just sounds like confidence.  Love me?  Love my glasses.  Thats what youre going to get because I cant see without them.  </p><p> </p><p>I have met some women that obviously feel that way by their actions.  It would be refreshing for them to bring it out in the open in a natural way.  Everyone acts like it is nothing but a fetish.  If thats all it was then I would not look beyond the glasses.  I like narrow hips, slender legs, muscle tone and definition, and a small face.  Nobody accuses me of having a fetish.  I like high heel pumps and peep toes, plaid skirts, and tall socks.  Thats not kinky; theyre just preferences.  Why is it so wrong to like a girl who wears glasses? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2009, 12:48</p><p>As a post-script - I tend to think many women grossly underestimate what a 'pushover' most men are anyway! Pete</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2009, 12:45</p><p>Jennifer - I can never understand why this is a problem. I have had numerous 'relationships' with GWGs and with no exception they have always been delighted that they turn me on wearing glasses, and can all 'see where I am coming from'. The women are only too pleased to have reassurance of their desireableness, loveliness, and sexiness. I think from a male point of view it is really easy - it keys into the natural female insecurity about appearance, and the women are delighted that they please their man so much. It also makes it really easy for a girl if she is feeling horny - she puts her glasses on and she has sure-fire (so to speak:)) 'intimacy'. I would have thought it was pretty easy for women too. Here's a tip for all you MIG-loving girlies. All you would need to do (at least if it was me) would be to snuggle up to the guy in an adoring feminine way, touch him up a bit (a few gently strokes) and say 'you just look SO masculine wearing you glasses' or some such ego-flettering stuff. Guys are a pushover. You try it. I await reports. Pete</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2009, 12:44</p><p>Any guy I was to meet for the first time would know right away how I feel about glasses, whether via email or on the phone.  I'd say something like, "Red, purple, clear, or blue, what eyewear should I wear for you?"  Needless to say, they liked having the choice, and it made it easier to recognize me when we did meet.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2009, 09:46</p><p>I've had relationship disasters with both situations. The first was when, after some time looking for a nice GWG, I decided to settle for a non-GWG. Oh, that was just a disaster! And then a few years later I found a GWG who liked me, and then once in a relationship discovered we weren't really very compatible!  </p><p> </p><p>One day it will all come right, I'm sure!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2009, 09:22</p><p>The love of the lens is very strong and it can make us do crazy things without thinking.  I consider it an addiction.  Meeting a guy with the ultimate glasses and personality is ideal.  There has to be a physical attraction, too.  Is he handsome? I've never stayed in a relationship just because of his glasses.  For me, it means so much more than just his glasses. But, the physical attraction becomes so much stronger when he meets all the requirements and the added bonus of his glasses! My question to all of you is...How do you reveal to your partner how much of a turn on glasses are?  How is this revealed so that it doesn't come across in the wrong way?  It's just so much easier if two OOs got together and everything is already out in the open.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2009, 03:54</p><p>Katy - I know exactly what you mean, but after a couple of experiences which could have so easily ended up like Nova Man I try to restrain myself and see past the glasses during the early encounters.  But it is not easy.  Blind to all her faults when looking at her glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2009, 19:54</p><p>Incidentally, I am sure I can't be the only male who has had an 'e-relationship' with a GWG who I met on this site.

Naturally, my chivalrous nature would mean I would not dream of revealing her identity, and to my great regret we have not had any contact for some time.However,we have never met in person.

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2009, 19:49</p><p>I don't suppose men who like GWGs and women who like MIGs have more relationship 'difficulties' than anyone else.I think it is just that intense sexual attraction of any kind can cause one to continue a relationship beyond it's natural length. GWG fans and female MIG fans getting together- wow that would be fun :) Although of course we are scattered all over the globe :) (Incidentally, I LOVE the inane expression 'all four corners of the globe'.................as if a spherical globe could have corners.................:))</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nova man</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2009, 18:04</p><p>Glasses can be way more powerful than some may think to the person with the fetish....ask me how I know....... I overlooked 7 years of dishonesty and mis leading things all for those time when I got to become "one" with them and what I was able to do to/with them. Until you have been in that situation never underestimate it. Now the biggest challenge is finding somone else who is not only a willing participant who dosent think I am a freak but is also stable and trustworth enough to have a regular relationship with as well. :(</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2009, 12:43</p><p>Katy, you overstate your weakness. I know you can be very strong and determined to do what you think is right. I'm tremendously biddable by comparison. Even though I'm married and I hate hurting my wife and daughter, I know that I'd never be able to resist an approach by an intelligent, attractive OO myopic GWG. Not that it's that likely a prospect, of course!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2009, 10:59</p><p>What I mean is that the glasses thing can be so strong that any kind of reason goes out the window. Of course there are other things I find attractive in men - dark hair, nice voice etc, but glasses are on a completely different level and this is what causes the problems. It means I don't take any kind of balanced view of the person and may get together with someone despite clear warning signs about their personality/situation/whatever. That's what I mean by 'the wrong reasons' - none of the other attractive features of someone cause problems like that, to me anyway. That's the difference between a preference and a fetish, I suppose.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2009, 21:39</p><p>You are right.  It is no different than someone saying they are a leg man or a boob man.  Some prefer blondes to brunettes, etc.  That we prefer our partners to need/wear glasses is no different.  We get into trouble when we allow our passions to overide reason in matters of the heart.  What's the old adage?  The heart has it's reasons that reason itself cannot understand?  I know I botched that quote, but you get my drift.   </p><p> </p><p>I don't understand totally what glasses mean to me personally only that it is something that can't be denied or ignored.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2009, 16:14</p><p>Wow, the thread is back from the dead! ;)  </p><p>Just a thought on your line- "Because either you are attracted to someone for the wrong reasons"  What are the right reasons? Every guy and every girl have turn-ons that are the "wrong reasons." A girl may like a guy who is into muscle building, or who has a deep voice. A guy may like a girl for her big boobs or some other body attribute. These things tell you no more about the person then if they happen to wear glasses or not. There's always some reason one or the other feels attracted enough to make contact. This very reason may also cause you to overlook other shortcomings. The real trick is that if you date the person long enough, at some point you will see past this and find out if you are really compatible.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2009, 13:20</p><p>Josh, I live in Wales and yes I have glasses, -2 &amp; some cyl.  </p><p> </p><p>It sounds like a lot of people have similar experiences.. I wonder if the OO thing is just bad for relationships? Because either you are attracted to someone for the wrong reasons (glasses) and it stops you seeing all the problems with the relationship, or you meet someone for the right reasons (no glasses) and then find yourself looking at other men/women or in my case in the past, dragging your partner to the opticians in the hope they'll prescribe some! You have to be very lucky to meet the right person both in terms of personality and in terms of the OO side of things.  </p><p> </p><p>And what about OOs getting together? Is that a good idea? I was thinking with the dating sites, there could be a word you put in your profile that could be searched for, but would not be noticeable to anyone else, eg. cheesecake under 'favourite foods'. I know that sounds a bit mad but it might work! :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2009, 09:14</p><p>Amy, </p><p> </p><p>From 1976 to around 1990 we had mostly large, plastic frames to choose from, and I always liked the look, and the comfort, that they gave me.  I guess you could say my motto would be, "Love me, love my glasses!"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amy</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2009, 08:15</p><p>Melyssa. I love how you like wearing noticable frames that make a statement. After all these tiny tiny frames I am definitely enjoying wearing the bigger styles. I expect they will gradually get bigger and bigger like they did last time about 20 years ago. Viz my mum and aunt's old photos.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2009, 07:44</p><p>I met my husband of now 8.5 years online, just over 10 years ago.  He told me right away that he wore glasses, and I told him about my fabulous collection, so we knew we would have to get together.  When we agreed to meet for our first date, I told him I'd be wearing red drop-temples.  At the place, he had no problem figuring out who was going to make his life a living heaven.  One of his sisters met her eventual second husband via the Internet as well.  So I guess we're a few of the lucky ones!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nova man</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2009, 22:42</p><p>Well yes sadly my wife of 7 years have just split and we had a hell of a glasses relationship awsome in every way possible, sex, games, nicknames, you name it toys, several different pairs, some that werent even hers off ebay. I saw the warning signs in the very beginning but the glasses and wat we did with them were just too hard to resist... now comes the hard part legalities,and such  no kids together though so that a plus......... Lookin for a GWG I know your out there !!!!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2009, 20:02</p><p>Katy/Josh/VLF - yes I can relate to that as well, I've been in two relationships in the last few years.  All the warning signs were there saying "don't do it!" but the glasses proved irresistable. Both relationships are over, the glasses are not enough to sustain things in the long term.  But oh so much fun at the time!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Josh</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2009, 14:48</p><p>Katy, where are you from? do you wear glasses too?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2009, 14:41</p><p>Clare, I think internet dating is the way forward - a lot of the happiest couples I know met online. I think it depends on your situation though, if you meet lots of guys at work etc then there's no need. The last time I did it I met my now ex-boyfriend within a couple of weeks and we were together for a few years. Now I think I should have been more picky! But actually the same thing happened then as is happening now - I couldn't resist his glasses, found him incredibly attractive, ignored all the warning signs and fell for him. But if you can have more self-control than me, I'd recommend going online! </p><p> </p><p>Phil, 'fun trouble' sounds familiar! The problem is my instincts often tell me to stay away from someone but the OOness overrides that and everything else.. </p><p> </p><p>josh &amp; VFL, glad it's not just me :-) VFL, what you say reminds me of something All4Eyes wrote about 'the power of the lens' - how true that is :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2009, 13:50</p><p>Katy, I have had the same problem.  Glasses aren't the only thing I look for in a man, but they can definitely push me off of the fence and make me do things that I wouldn't otherwise.  Those eyes gazing at me through lenses can literally make me go a little crazy. </p><p> </p><p>Throughout my life this hasn't always been a good thing.  Sometimes the man behind the glasses is totally unworthy of my attentions and affection.  But it is not something I can turn on and off at will.   </p><p> </p><p>It is not every man who wears glasses, but when all the stars line up and the chemistry is right, I become hopelessly devoted.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>josh</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2009, 12:35</p><p>Katy, happening exactly the same to me, glasses makes my choice, if there are two beauty girls one with and another without i will pick the gwg no doubt!!! i`m not alone in the world...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2009, 11:52</p><p>Katy, you should go with your instincts. It might mean 'trouble' but it will be 'fun' trouble. I'm like you. My former gf was a disaster area in so many ways. Twice divorced, 4 kids and wilful, and my relationship with her nearly broke up my marriage. But she was just a perfect gwg. Lovely frames, perfect mid-range myopia. I'd have gone to end of earth for her. I even abandoned family to spend weekend in Lakes with her. It was the most perfect 2 days of my life-even though fallout at home lingers on 4 years later!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2009, 11:44</p><p>Katy - you're very brave! I've always wondered what online dating would be like and worried that everyone would turn out to be a disappointment and a wasted evening (time is precious after all!). Perhaps your unorthodox selection technique will be more successful. Good luck!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2009, 10:40</p><p>Recently I joined a dating site and I'm having a bit of a problem making rational decisions about the guys on there... there is one in particular who I wouldn't normally go for, based on some of the things in his profile, but there is a photo of him with glasses (he's nice looking) with incredible cut in - maybe a -8 or 9. I am finding that I apply different criteria depending on the glasses status of the guy. With ones like him I am very lenient, overlooking all sorts of stuff that would usually put me off. Then there are the ones with just one glasses photo where I can't tell the rx, or no glasses and the possibility of contacts.. these are intriguing and I'm quite open-minded about these too. The ones that I am quite harsh on are those with glasses and an obviously very low rx... I suppose with these there is no hope of any OOness.  Does anyone else have this problem? I know it sounds very shallow and I should be basing my decisions on personality etc but I do find that the glasses really affect how I react to the guy. It has got me in trouble in the past.. maybe I should try to do something about it. Anyway just thought I'd share that :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LL</b>&nbsp;01 Oct 2009, 00:05</p><p>The best lenses are constants minus 8 and higher. Put them in large frames, so the lenses are at least half an inch thick. Fog them and then lick them...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wei</b>&nbsp;11 Apr 2009, 22:57</p><p>Mysodisc is lens very good i think is not blend yes vision small good is frame for mysodisc?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2006, 06:47</p><p>Lucky Guy - -2.75 isn't too debilitating but for someone who's used to contacts it will seem much worse than to someone who wears glasses but not all the time. I'd hazard a guess that she'd be inclined to wear them nearly all the time, possibly not indoors - although she'd definately need them for watching anything on the TV - and not for reading.  But then you never can tell -I have a friend with this rx who wears glasses or contacts 100% of the time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2006, 19:20</p><p>Don't underestimate -2.75. If you have normal vision, pick up some +3 readers at a drug store and put them on. Look around the room, you'll see what a -2.75 sees uncorrected.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Charlotte</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2006, 06:39</p><p>Lucky Guy </p><p>You might be pleasantly surprised. I have a friend who wears -2.75 contacts and he is rarely without some form of correction either glasses or contacts, even inside the house.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JC</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2006, 09:50</p><p>Lucky Guy - </p><p> </p><p>Kind of hard to say how much she might wear glasses if she couldn't wear her contacts.  At that prescription a person would be able to get around their house or other familiar areas without a problem, but given that she wears lenses all day she might be so used to corrected vision that without them she would be uncomfortable to do anything.  Or she might not want to be seen wearing glasses and try to use them only when absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lucky Guy</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2006, 08:51</p><p>At Christmas I discovered a girl I've been seeing wears contact lenses. I was using the bthroom and saw two boxes marked L and R and both were -2.75. I hope she'll have to wear glasses for some reason soon but I wanted to ask this, if she can't wear contact lenses how much will she need to wear glasses, would it be just for driving and tv or even just when she's in the house too? </p><p> </p><p>She seems to wear the lenses morning till night, what might mean she couldn't wear them apart from the obvious things like an eye infection, and can she wear them every day? I've known people who don't wear them 24/7.</p><p></p><hr>

The second time I brought it out to try it on some specs I bought at a thrift store, I finally got the idea of putting the specs in right side up, and since they were heavily tinted, not using too bright of backlighting. Just as I got it working, in pops my wife earlier than expected! </p><p> </p><p>Aghrghhhh.

The only time I use the master is because I prefer the shower in that one.

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2002, 07:54</p><p>Here's another chuckle regarding our bathroom.  I rarely wear my glasses, but for some reason was wearing them and went to take a shower.  Put them on the aforementioned end of the counter, in my wife's "nest of glasses" which she hadn't put in their cases for awhile.  Came out of the shower, towelled off, reached into the "nest" and grabbed what I thought were mine.  Slipped them on and nearly lost it, it was one of her pairs.  As I'm around a +1.00 and she's a -4.75 with about -1.50 cyl, that's a pretty big swing in diopters. Will continue to wear my contacts in the future, and if I do go in that room with glasses will put mine on the other end of the counter.</p><p></p><hr>

My wife has a decorative small wicker basket, in it at any given time are at least five hard glasses cases.  Two are empty, three (as of yesterday) contained an Emporio Armani, a Giorgio Armani, and a semi-rimless Police.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2002, 23:02</p><p>Yes; it's pretty much the same story in the UK.

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2002, 17:39</p><p>Tina, </p><p>I concur with your comments about "Lenscr*apters". I got my first pair there. The first time through the lenses were deliverd to me scratched, and then they reversed the lenses, which warped out the frame - to say nothing of the "sensation". They never even delivered in "under an hour". </p><p> </p><p>I went to an actual person to get my glasses made up after that. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2002, 10:38</p><p>Tina--my reply to you was posted in Glasses for Sale.  I didn't click back to reply to you until after I had read through the topics.  Unfortunately, I chose the wrong topic to reply.  Thanks for your tips, though.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tina</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2002, 21:47</p><p>Hi Russell -  </p><p> </p><p>This is a very late reply to your post, but I didn't find this site until recently.   </p><p> </p><p>You ought to try the following chain for glasses:  One Price Optical, but sometimes they go by different names.  They have locations in Austin, TX, Fort Worth; Chattanooga and Knoxville TN; New York OUTER BOROUGHS like Brooklyn Queens and Nassau; several places in the Deep South i.e. Baton Rouge LA and Biloxi MS; Fort Wayne and South Bend IN; Rockford and Peoria IL; and Topeka as well as some other cities in KS.   </p><p> </p><p>These guys will set you up with single vision simple prescription for about $29.00 or $39.00.  Usually they charge about $20.00 extra for high index.  I DO NOT know how high of a prescription they will fill, as the strongest part of mine is a -3.25 astigmatism correction.  I'm almost certain they will go up to + or - 8, but I don't know if they will charge an arm and a leg for stronger than that. </p><p> </p><p>They have a GREAT selection of many DESIGNER frames - generally discontinued stock, often from the cool European makers.  They've got a lot of the Italian and German brands - really cool hip frames. </p><p> </p><p>They will fill plastic or glass.  There is sometimes an extra charge for glass - about $20.00.  I know there's an extra charge for some of the plastic varieties.  I don't like plastic glasses. </p><p> </p><p>If you let me know a state, I can give you a phone number of a location as close as possible.  I don't work for them.  Their locations may have changed, as I am looking at a piece of advertising that is about 3 years old.  However, I recently had some glasses done and am very happy with them. </p><p> </p><p>Don't go to Lenscr*pters.  Not only do they charge an ARM &amp; A LEG, but I once had a 'script filled there and I noticed some distortion in the plastic that they filled it with.  If I could see the distortion by moving the glasses around in front of my eyes, I know there was an error in the manufacturing process.  Since this experience, I have requested *glass* and have avoided work being done at Lenscr*apters. </p><p> </p><p>By the way, if your do a lot of athletics, I wouldn't recommend glass, but my roughest activity is hiking, so I choose glass because it hardly ever scratches and is a LOT easier to clean.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2002, 12:32</p><p>Dockman: Before you start polishing the lenses, you need to buy the rouge.  I got it from a company called Visioneer (1-800-837-4000).  It was $12.95 which is a l pound chunk good for our lifetimes.  If you don't use this on the rag wheel on your grinder, the lens will heat up to much and crack.  You just put this on the wheel as it is turning and then apply the lens rotating it over and over until you get the shine you want.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dockman</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2002, 11:16</p><p> I have some old glasses that are broken across the bridge that I could never glue back together. I'll try edge polishing them and see how shiny I can get them.Thanks for the tip.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2002, 10:45</p><p>The same way they justify charging the outrageous charges on everything.  There is no way that the little bit of metal or plastic in an eyeglass frame can cost even $50, much less the $350 that many of them cost.  Likewise, it couldn't cost the $200 or more to make some of the lenses that are offered.  The optical companies have a good scam going, and they will keep it up.  I am amazed at a chain optician near me.  They almost continually have a half price sale.  And why is that?  Because at half price, a complete pair of glasses costs at least $150.  That is for a little bit of plastic, some metal, and less than an hour's worth of a technician's time.  I realize that it costs money to set up a lab and train technicians, but come on!  These people are selling all the time.  They are making money hand over fist!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2002, 10:45</p><p>Stingray, I started a new thread "Lenses" and crossposted your comments there. Thanks for the post!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2002, 10:30</p><p>You know when you buy glasses you opt for the polished edges and they charge you $10.00 or more for this.  Well, It's a giant rip-off.  The rouge that you use to polish the lenses comes in a 1 pound block which is enough to process probably 1000 lenses.  The grinding wheel made of cloth costs $5.00.  It takes no more than 2 minutes to shine those lenses to look like mirrors.  So basically, it costs the optician no more than 10 cents worth of material and no more than 2 minutes of his time. So how do they justify $10?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dockman</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2002, 07:19</p><p>I went in to the same office today and the same girl waited on me. I got close enough to see her eyes and never saw a contact, so she must have had refractive surgery done. Her eyes are so red though. Just a jumble of red veins running across what should be white.They really look terrible.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dockman</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2002, 06:02</p><p>Went in to an office yesterday to make an insurance payment where I know two GWG's work. The one girl who was there wears a substantial minus, however yesterday she was without her glasses. Her eyes were bloodshot and irritated. Being eye-conscious, I wondered if she had gotten Lasik or was just suffering through trying to wear contacts because I doubt she could have seen me standing there without any correction. I didn't have the nerve to ask what happened to her glasses.It would be a pity if she didn't have to wear them anymore.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Daffy</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2002, 13:33</p><p>Portia, </p><p> </p><p>Yeah it can get expensive. International post is not expensive. I pay on average $4. Sometimes a lot less. I get them within 7 days. I set a limit and if someone goes beyond that, well, good luck to them. I do this maybe once every couple of months. Not too often to warrant therapy. </p><p> </p><p>I hate the bastards that tell me that shipping is about $8 only to get the mail and see they paid $2.75. The only hitch that is stopping me from buying a lot of other things is the conversion rate.

<p><b>HalimM</b>&nbsp;05 Jan 2002, 15:54</p><p>&lt;b&gt;Hi all,&lt;/b&gt; </p><p>this is my first post to ES BBS, I've found it few days and I was surprised how many people is interested in wide range of optic and glasses topics. Let me join this gorgous communitty : ) </p><p>I'am 25 years old male phD student at University and all my world turns about glasses. </p><p>&lt;b&gt;At first&lt;/b&gt;, I wear specs myself down to shortsightness.I was told to have vision problems when I was 10 and I couldn't read clearly the blackboard at school in all cases.Parents took me to eye doc and I was prescribed first specs -1.0D.I was so excited and frightned and I resist wearing glasses becouse of other kids reactions.I used to wear it only for lessons. When I grew up I understood matter of myopia and I stopped take care about other oppinions. Step by step I was impressed by those pices of glass that made my world clear and sharp.When I was 15 I became full time wearer with -2,5D, I realized to myself that I like watching other people with glasses.It was great time because I noticed that my younger sister (she was 10) also had vision problems.Once when I came back from school I saw her sitting very close to TV set and watching some movie.I knew what was going on and I gave her my old specs.She could see better. As you can imagine I told about it to my mom and, three days gone and my little sister appear to me wearing beautifull -2.0 glasses.she adjusted it quickly and wore all yhe time from the beginning.We used to talk about our specs and try it each other time to time, but I've never reveald my fascination about vision.Years went and our eyes have worsened sistematicall, we went to eye doc together usually and I put down all the moments. So our story was : </p><p>Age(Me,Lena)			Me			Lena </p><p>10,5			-1,00L;-1.00R			------ </p><p>13,8			-1,75L;-1,50R			------ </p><p>15,10			-2,50L;-2,25R		  -2,00L;-2,00R	 </p><p>16,11			-3,50L;-3,25R		  -2,25L;-2,00R </p><p>17,12			-3,75L;-3,25R		  -3,75L;-3,50R </p><p>18,13			-3,75L;-3,25R		  -4,50L;-4,25R </p><p>19,14			-3,75L;-3,50R		  -5,25L;-5,00R </p><p>20,15			-4,00L;-3,50R		  -6,00L;-5,50R </p><p>My myopia stoped then, and this is my current one </p><p>   16						  -6,50L;-6,25R </p><p>   17        					  -7,00L;-6,75R </p><p>And when I was 22 I left my parents home so I stoped to collect detailed data, but Lena's myopia stopped about her 20 with about -8 lenses. </p><p>It was really amazing to grew up and watch how her prescription change. </p><p>&lt;b&gt;Second:&lt;/b&gt;I am totally crazy about girls with glasses, to be honest I am hundred percent glasses fetishist : ) </p><p>There is nothing more sexy and attractive then preety, sensual girl with minus lenses.I love watching women touch glasses, put it better on nose if sllip down, clean lenses.Women can do it on very sensual and sexy way.well choosen specs make woman so hot, and eyes covered begind minus lenses are so mysterious.DELICIOUS :) </p><p>My favorites are: long black hair, brown eyes, metal frames choosen according to face and normal minus lenses from -3 to -10. I could jump into fire for that girl :) </p><p>So, it is a bit long as first post and I don't wont to be boring. </p><p>Apologize for all mistakes, but englids id not my first language( but I'am still working to make it more fluent and I hope to express all what I fell soon) </p><p>&lt;b&gt;BEST WISHES&lt;/b&gt; 	</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2001, 13:41</p><p>For some reason I've been nostalgic lately over the faceted lenses that were popular in the 80s. The lenses were really emphasized by the faceting, and amazingly this was marketed as a solution for high minus wearers. "Beautify thick lenses" was an actual quote I read from a frame catalog at that time (BerDel I think). The glasses were very eye-catching and looked good on a lot of faces, although they did tend to overwhelm others. </p><p> </p><p>A few companies still make them, and I do see them around periodically, but nothing like in the heyday of '83 to '85 when they were a legit eyewear fad. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;22 Dec 2001, 12:41</p><p>Sure LikeGlass - Start it as a national event - then let it take off internationally - culminating in 'World Surprise Eyes' in the Year 20/20.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;22 Dec 2001, 11:05</p><p>So, how about a new holiday?  Ive often wondered just how many of the girls I meet actually wear glasses, but opt for contacts. Heres the concept: Kind of like a smoke out day, except it would be a contact-out day. Call it Surprise Eyes Day.   Which would have to be February 20th. (02 /20) So, I set up a page on my site (TGWG), inviting girls to submit pics that would be displayed there, and on 02/20, a Specs Quean will be crowned! Think we could start a national trend here? ;)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eddy</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2001, 02:41</p><p>Hey, Chino, I can only reflect Stingray. Go for it. I only ever had one gwg blind date. Ah yes, I remember it as if it was yesterday, and it's several decades since it went into double figures. Pasqualina d'Alessandro. Oh yes, ugly as a hatful of arseholes as the saying used to be but great cat's eyes, a wondrous body and a very witty person. (Yes, Pasky, it's me if you happen to be reading this. Give me a call any time. Someone will answer the old number). I'll admit that things started a bit slowly but about an hour into the evening the ice was seriously broken with the phrase "Eduardo, do you believe in love at first sight". Ah, la jeunesse (or in this case la giovinezza). Chino, if one older but no wiser could proffer a word of advice, NEVER NEVER spurn a gwg blind date. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2001, 02:00</p><p>Are lenses becoming more lovable? </p><p>I was thinking of the reports that kids all over the UK are clamouring for eye tests so that they can get a cool pair of Harry Potter frames. My local free paper, however, reports that here in the middle of nowhere, that's not the case. They've interviewed local opticians and they say there hasn't been an increase locally to match the national trend. But they do have the frames in stock - so they're ready! </p><p>There's also a quote from Anita Lightstone at the Royal National Institute for the Blind, who says "Positive role models such as Harry Potter are priceless in the drive to persuade children themselves that wearing glasses is cool."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2001, 18:12</p><p>Chino:  Go for it.  I once had a blind date who wore glasses, nice body, great personality, but not very good looking.  At age 22, that was very important to me, especially what my friends would think of her.  When they saw her and told me I could do better than that, I dumped her.  I've always regretted doing that.  But that was over 30 years ago.  So man, go for it.  Just judge the person on what they are, how they relate to you, how they feel about you.  Believe me, looks aren't that important.  Other qualities mean so much more.  And if she wears glasses, that is always a plus in my book.  I convinced my wife not to get lasik surgery, telling her how much I liked her in glasses and she wears them because she knows how I feel about it.  So if you like this girl and she likes you, compliment her on anything, it goes a long way.  Tell me how it goes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>slb</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2001, 16:37</p><p>I dont know if this explains the strange vision effects with flourescent lights but unlike incandesant lighting flourescent tubes flash off and on.  This is at twice the mains frequency (ie about 100 times a second) and caused by the fact that light is only produced when electricity is flowing.  Incandesant lights just emit light due to being very hot and so they dont flash like this. </p><p> </p><p>Simon</p><p></p><hr>

I was recently on a course and sat in the middle a room with normal lighting, was able to read the board with hardly any problems, the following day we were shifted to another area which had flourescent lighting and even though I was sitting closer than the day before I had great difficulty reading from that distance, to the point where I had to admit to the person next to me that I couldn't read the board and could I borrow their notes....that was huge for me, but I needed the info!!!

I know I've talked all kinds of shit, and I've said what I want outta life.  Actually experiencing it is a whole different thing altogether.  I plan on giving her a call this Friday.

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2001, 06:21</p><p>Oh, I hear ya hearty!  I hate that...there's the loud "crack" and that feeling like my finger want to snap into a million pieces...Argh.  Heard the craziest way to avoid it though...Hold the door until you touch the ground.  Has to do with electrically grounding yourself or something.  So far, it seems to work (though it has been kinda humid here lately).  But give it a try and let me know how it works for you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2001, 04:49</p><p>My favorite is when they are in front of Venetian blinds and you can see the distortion through their lenses. Their eyes are clear, and the blinds line up (well, don't actually) at the edge of the lens.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lowminusman</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2001, 19:25</p><p>How does a person estimate the glasses prescription of a person by looking at a photo of them or for that matter, seeing them in person?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2001, 14:01</p><p>Chino, I have been testing the thing with my new GF for 3 weeks. The answer is No. We stick together anytime we touch with any parts of our bodies, but the lenses have never hold together. However, they make nice click-click. </p><p>8-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2001, 12:54</p><p>Speaking of static, do sparks fly when two spec-wearers kiss?  And if so, is there any chance of the lenses getting stuck together? </p><p> </p><p>Chino, having a wee bit of fun with the magnetic glasses bit.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;12 Nov 2001, 19:17</p><p>You can probably still stick balloons to your lenses tho. (tho you, with the glass lenses - might be denied this most basic of pleasures) </p><p> </p><p>Oh well, it would probably smuge them, and we know how that raises your dander!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2001, 23:59</p><p>Leelee - that might work with plastic frames and plastic lenses - serves me right for getting metal frames with glass lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lazysiow</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2001, 00:34</p><p>Hi, anyone know how magnetize a lens like those magnetic clipons? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lowminusman</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2001, 13:59</p><p>For an optician or someone who knows, is it possible to change the prescription of a lens at home? By grinding it or some other means?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2001, 00:13</p><p>I wasa waya over the weekend Julian, and I saw a newspaper report about Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) turning up bare-eyed for the movie premier. I also saw a very small item in another newspaper about a 'popspecs' award, apparently given to celebs who suddenly show up wearing glasses. Anyone know anything about that?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2001, 23:28</p><p>Another gem from the UK news: with the release of the first Harry Potter film, kids all over the country are wanting to wear glasses like the hero...but the star apparently attended the premiere bare eyed - odd, because when he was selected for the part it was reported that he had glasses but didn't wear them much.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2001, 00:58</p><p>Julian, Thanks for that information. I would have guessed that it was higher than that, but then i started wearing glasses when i was 6 y/o and my parents didn't have a clue up until that time that anything was wrong with my vision. My estimated first Rx was around -3.00 too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2001, 22:44</p><p>For the second time in 24 hours I have a serious post and I can't see a thread where it obviously belongs. </p><p> </p><p>A new report from the Royal National Institute for the Blind in the UK says a survey showed that between 17 and 22% of school children have undetected vision problems and urges eye tests for all children (free for kids on the NHS anyway) on starting school and at the transition to senior school. </p><p> </p><p>A bit more often would be better...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2001, 09:57</p><p>I think the size and shape of the lens produces that effect. They have to use a pretty big lens blank on those frames and therefore, with all the math being equal, the lens gets pretty thick at the center, giving it the appearance of a higher power lens. When I bought the frames I was looking for maximum field of vision and I must admit even I was surprised when the spesc were done.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2001, 23:44</p><p>And those are only +2? I'd have guessed more. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2001, 09:55</p><p>Just put a page up about the Frame attraction. (see link below) Frames can really project a personality. BTW, after getting ripped in my email about not having any pics of me in glasses on the web, I added a pic to my mail page- </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132720/http://www.geocities.com/likeglass55/john.html" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/likeglass55/john.html</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2001, 08:26</p><p>This is more about frames, but never mind. </p><p> </p><p>I was thinking (while washing up this morning!) that maybe designer frames are like status symbols, a bit like owning a fast car. I have seen people in old fashioned (I like!) frames and the often seem to have, basically, less money than those with brand new fashion specs (I don't usually like!) </p><p> </p><p>Puffin</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2001, 12:52</p><p>As I posted below, my favorite part of the whole GWG thing is the lens. To this end, I set up a survey on my site to try to get a feel of what everyone out there is wearing. Boring questions have been replaced with things like What is your Rx? This should be neat as we all can view it as it grows. To take or view the survey, go over to my site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132720/http://www.geocities.com/likeglass55/" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/likeglass55/</a> and scroll to the bottom of the page. There are links back to Eye Scene and Lens Chat there. Thanks! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2001, 17:58</p><p>My origins story is from ninth grade. I was riding in the back seat of my grandparent's car, just a few blocks from where I now live. I looked over to the sidewalk and saw a lovely brunette in a silky blue dress, perhaps in her late twenties, wearing large blue plastic frames with a heavy-looking black chain dangling off the temples. Somehow her glasses were such a complement to her beauty that I was really bowled over. I've been a GWG admirer ever since.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2001, 16:58</p><p>For me, it all probably started in the second or third grade. I had a childhood crush on this girl named Pam. We were talking in class and we were both "sent into the hall." This was a kind of punishment you would get in elementary school for being bad. For me, it was life-changing! Pam, was quite myopic. While we continued to chat in the hall, I couldn't help but notice her glasses, it was the first real close look I had gotten. Remember, this is from an 8 year old's perspective. Her lenses made the whole world look different... Tiny ! To me it was like she was seeing the world through some type of kaleidoscope! Boy, she must be lucky! As I grew up, I learned what was really going on, but, too late! I was hooked! I cannot explain why this fascination only occurs with regards to girls with glasses, as compared to all glasses. I wear glasses myself, and find them a bother, yet to this day, the fascination with GWG's continues! To me, a girl without glasses looks downright boring! </p><p></p><hr>
