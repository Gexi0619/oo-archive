<p><b>Johnny</b>&nbsp;02 May 2017, 10:54</p><p>I've recently started wearing my glasses during sex, rather than whisking them off straight away. I'm -2.5 in both eyes, so I don't need to wear them, but it definitely adds an extra thrill (plus my girlfriend seems to like it too "it's like having sex with a different person"). Am just wondering - who else keeps their specs on during lovemaking? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2016, 19:17</p><p>  My girlfriend Cheryl is coming up on a year since getting bifocals,and a small increase in her distance Rx. </p><p>  She has said that she thinks that she needs more in the bifocal,but I think,and hope she gets a bit more minus also. </p><p>  Lately she seems to prefer wearing her over minus glasses,and there is a little squinting going on ,for both near and distance,similar to before her last exam.She says she is not squinting though. </p><p>  Although she is OK with wearing strong glasses,she still is upset with needing any increases,as she feels defective,and that goes back to her early days in glasses.She is embarrassed when she can not see the eye chart,that she thinks the doctor expects her to see. </p><p>  Within the next few days we are going to test her eyes with my trial lense set.We did that about six months ago and at that time, it appeared that she needed about -.50 in her better eye.Perhaps that will relieve some of her anxiety,over getting the exam. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pablo</b>&nbsp;24 Jan 2016, 21:06</p><p>I have a similar story as Tom. My wife is 33 years old. I started dating her when she was 20. She has perfect vision. Her sister is 3 years younger than her. When her sister was 18, she (her sister) was prescribed with -0,50 glasses. She was very shy about wearing them and used to wear them only when studying or reading at home. By that time my wife (who was my girlfriend), lived with her. Frequently her sister studied in the living room. After studying she used to leave the books, notepads and her glasses over the table. Many times, after having dinner with my girlfriend, I used to go to her house to watch a movie together, play card games or just to have some intimate moment. I've always have had a glasses fetish. But I've never told anybody about it. I remember watching those black rectangular frame with wide arms over the table dreaming about my girlfriend wearing them. </p><p>Once they were over the couch. When my gf was almost seating over them I told her to be careful. So she grabbed the glasses and joked about that if she had broken them, her sister would be happy because she hates wearing glasses. After that she tried them on and was surprised of the weak prescription. She thought her sister was more myopic. I told her that her green eyes looked even better with glasses and that I really loved her look wearing them. Since that, every time we were alone in her house, she used to wear the glasses. Even once, when her sister was on a trip over Europe, and her glasses at home, my girlfriend stayed in my house and wore the glasses for a whole week. </p><p>Time passed and gradually she stopped wearing the glasses. </p><p>Last year when her mother was cleaning her house, my wife went to see if she wanted something of the packed boxes she was about to dump. And when we were opening a box, she found those glasses. She put them on and asked me if I remembered those. I answered I could never forget that lovely glasses girl. So she smiled, took them off and put them in her purse. Since then, she is wearing those glasses again sometimes when we are alone at home and I love it!  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rick</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2016, 09:26</p><p>I personaly always found glasses sexy. My wife was nearsighted, and she had astigmatism. Her prescription was -8.5 in both eye, and I her astigmatisim was around -1.75 and -2.25. I loved how they made her eyes look. I mean her eyes were do pretty already, but when she put on her glasses, they got prettier. I loved the rings in her lenses. For me they made her and her glasses look that much more sexy. While I do think glasses are sexy, I also thought it was so sexy when she would take them off or would not have them. One time our then youngest son broke her glasses and she always gave away her old glasses, so she was squinting and holding stuff up to her nose. When we would go out she was dependent on me, and it made us closer. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2016, 01:21</p><p>Tom  </p><p> Since you said that your wife's sister's glasses are from twenty years ago,that would date them to about 1995. </p><p> The glasses that Cheryl has go back to the late 1920's,to 1930's.They are 12K Gold,and have very thick glass lenses,and are very close to Cheryl's minus nineish actual Rx.We found them at an antique show last summer,and initially Cheryl liked the frames,but was elated that she could see very well through them.She affectionately calls them her " Goldies ". </p><p> This past Thanksgiving Day holiday weekend we went to her mom's home,and like your wife mom,Cheryl's gave her all of her old glasses,complete with all of their prescriptions, way back to her first pair.I am in the process of making a nice display case for them. </p><p> When Cheryl tries on her old glasses,she can not believe how weak they are,and it makes her a little sad that her Rx is as strong as it is now,and that several months age she went into her first bifocals.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2016, 13:34</p><p>Likelenses, fully agree, those "12k gold" frames are very special. </p><p> </p><p>When my wife's parents sold their house a few weeks ago to move to a new flat, they asked their children to come to the house where they grew up and collect belongings their parents had found and packed for them. </p><p> </p><p>I helped my wife carry her boxes into our house, and together we started unpacking and found old schoolbooks, photographs, dolls,... Much to her surprise she also opened a box in which she found several pairs of glasses she had worn since her youth, all of them in excellent state. By mistake her parents had also packed some of her older sister's glasses in the same box, and one pair was very delicate metal gold looking frames with rather thick lenses in them (before the hi-index lenses were launched). My wife laughed as she immediately recognized those as Amy's (her sister, who is 5y older) when she went to college, and told me she had been jealous at the time about her sister's high-end frames. She took off her own glasses to try on her sister's from 20y ago, told me "wait, those are reaaaaally strong", but was surprised and bit shocked at how well she could see through them, while she had always thought her sister's prescriptions were much stronger than hers. She came to the conclusion that her own eyesight deteriorated over the past 20y to the same level as her sister's 20y ago. But the frames fit her really well and she looked very sophisticated in them. </p><p> </p><p>Later that evening she called Amy, told her about finding her old glasses and asked whether she could keep them and fit them with her own prescription, which her sister readily accepted!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2016, 01:15</p><p>  Cheryl and I went to a great New Years eve party. </p><p>  When I went to pick her up,she was just putting the finishing touches on her makeup. </p><p>  She was in a dither as to which glasses to wear.She looked lovely in a little black dress and heels. She was wearing her rimless bifocals,but was not totally decided that they were right for the occasion.Her blue cat eyes myos were out of the question,and her Wayfarer type didn't cut it as far as I was concerned.I suggested she wear her antique 12 K Gold ,with the original glass lenses that are very close to her Rx,but are not bifocals.She slipped them on,and it took my breath away how beautiful she looked. </p><p>  When we got to the event all of the women that were bespectacled were envious,and wanted to know where she got those glasses.The lighting was subdued,supplemented by candlelight,and the Gold frames,and thick glass lenses made her face radiant. </p><p>  I had to read the menu to her because they are single vision lenses.Even though she had her backup bifocals in her purse,she did not want to wear them and tarnish the image that she had created.( How vein is woman ) </p><p>  Everyone on the dance floor was sneaking a peek at her.She was truly the belle of the ball!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>murky </b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2015, 00:22</p><p>At a local opshop I found a gorgeous pair of Hary Lary ( brand Invady)made in France big bold womens red and blue glasses, by coincidence they are +1 with +2.0 for reading, multifocal, must have cost well over $1000, got them for 20 dollars, fantastic things. I can see perfectly through them. </p><p>Went overseas for 3 weeks are wore them everywhere, on the plane the Stewardess called loudly," and now to serve the gentleman with the wonderful glasses!" </p><p>To see people looking at me with vague wonder, shop assistants hesitate, wide mouthed, was so exciting, and to put them on, and go down to a meal was arousing++. Sadly when I came home, had not the courage to wear them to work, or with family.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>High Myopic</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2014, 19:42</p><p>@Likelenses, You said you have a pair of glasses that you can sell me?  I cannot afford to pay 350 dollars for that pair. I will be much much more willing to pay like 40 or 50 dollars for your pair.  Can you accept preloaded gift cards?   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;09 Jul 2014, 18:06</p><p> I think that it is a fair question due to the fact that Carrie seems to enjoy flaunting her lesbian affair with a great amount of detail.So she has created some questions. </p><p> I have wondered what role she plays in this affair.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2014, 00:44</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Your last post,with all of the details,got me curious. Is it your girlfriend that wears a strap on,or is it you,or do your switch?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2014, 07:53</p><p>It was Tom's wife the one who sneaked around the house. </p><p>My sister in law glasses were -1,50, she used to wear them only when studying because she was a little shy about them. I remember once I was driving and she was in the car that she was squinting a lot to see through the window. After some time, my girlfriend (who also was in the car) suggested wearing the glasses. She put them on, but as soon we arrived the family meeting we were going she took them off.  </p><p>As time passed and she became more myopic (I think around -2,50) she became a full time wearer, but most of the time she wears contacts.  </p><p>The glasses I bought for my wife are not all OTC readers, she has a range going from -5,50 till +3,50. Obviously, the ones she prefer are a -0,25 black cat eyes with orange inside. When we go to the movies she always takes those glasses because she enjoys driving me crazy in public spaces. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2014, 15:50</p><p>Mark </p><p> </p><p>Clearly your wife has much more than a passing interest in glasses and it doesn't even seem that she is only trying on and wearing glasses for your pleasure, but more for her own pleasure. We have seen in here from time to time where people will often nosy around someone else's bathroom maybe checking the prescription of unopened contacts or even trying on a pair of glasses left in the bathroom. But your wife is way more daring by actually going into some of her friends handbags and drawers looking for glasses to try on. If she were ever caught it could be very embarising and she could even be arrested for stealing because they would probably think she was looking for money. No doubt since you know about these things your wife has told you about doing these things? Since she does know how much you enjoy seeing her wearing glasses have you ever suggested getting her her own glasses to wear so she maybe would stop going through other peoples things before she gets caught. Nowadays many people have video equipment all over their house in case of robbery. I'm sure she wouldn't want to end up a star in such a video.  </p><p>The glasses she "borrowed" for a week, were they weak enough that she could wear them and see okay with them or weer they a bit too strong for her eyes? Maybe sit down with her and have her look at all the great glasses she could get from Zenni. They even have an option she may enjoy playing with as well. She can post her picture in there and actually try on glasses that way to see how they look on her. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2014, 04:36</p><p>Mark, </p><p> </p><p>a small contribution to your survey. The word "fetish" is never used in my relation. To me, glasses are the proverbial cherry on the cake - I simply love it when my life partner wears her -12 glasses during the day. It's great to have a partner with two entirely different faces (daytime vs night time). There is nothing like a fetish from her side but she enjoys the luxury of having the choice between half a dozen glasses nowadays. When we first met, she simply used her glasses because dry eyes made the use of contact lenses problematic. She was reassured that I liked her in glasses. When my photography project started, she was my first model and she never stopped supporting me. Gradually I noticed that the project gave her a more self assured attitude towards her looks in glasses and she now says that she would never switch back to contact lenses. She will have her 60th birthday on Sunday, a big garden party with a lot of live music, and she asked me to bring along a nice pair of green cat eye glasses to match her green dress. So far, these cat eye glasses are only used for photo shoots but they have her prescription for long distance. She now uses half a dozen Zenni pairs in daily life and enjoys having so much choice, a luxury unknown to her before the project started. I look forward to see her in the extravagant cat eye glasses at the garden party, especially as she requested me to bring them along. Nice!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2014, 03:14</p><p>Mark </p><p> </p><p>My wife does not exactly have a glasses fetish herself, in the sense that she is especially attracted by guys in glasses, but she gets very excited by trying on other people's glasses. Either by commenting ladies on their glasses, and eventually be in a position they are handed over to her for a try, or by doing so more secretly. </p><p> </p><p>For example, when at friends of whom she knows they wear glasses, she always looks for spare glasses in the houses (handbags, kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms are the best places) to quickly try on. Now that some friends of hers are in their late thirties or early forties, reading glasses become a more common item also. </p><p> </p><p>A good friend of hers, who is a full time wearer of moderately minus glasses, is very fashion conscious and buys a new pair almost every year. She van be seen in different pairs often, as she also still uses her older specs. Meaning her house, handbag, car,... are good places to find glasses, and because there are so many of them, my wife even managed to "borrow" a nice pair of glasses recently for a week. She returned them of course, but her friend never noticed. We had some fun evenings with those specs at home :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2014, 11:42</p><p>Mark </p><p>From what you described back when you were still dating your future wife it seems like you both had a glasses fetish and still do? But having her wear over the counter readers i'm sure only blurs her vision for anything more than a couple of feet away. If you like how your wife looks wearing glasses and want her to even wear them more often you should probably go on line and order her some glasses in either a -.75 or -1.00 prescription. Her eyes would have no problem at all adjusting to them.  </p><p>Was she sure her sister's glasses were -1.50 and not +1.50? If she only wore them when she was studying they were more likely +1.50. A -1.50 she would need for distance and certainly for driving.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2014, 10:11</p><p>Mark - my girlfriend doesn't know about my fetish although she knows that glasses certainly don't put me off a woman as she wears glasses full time. She uses her glasses as a signal to me that she wants more than just cuddling on the sofa! She will just give me a certain look and then the glasses come off. Sometimes she takes them off quickly sometimes it's slowly. Then she goes a bit feisty and assertive (quite unlike how she is the rest of the time) and I have to quickly take my glasses off as we don't always bother to wait until we get to our bedroom! She knows all of that is a massive turn-on for me. I do a similar thing to her except I go all submissive (I am quite a feisty lady, so I've been told) and she loves that! </p><p>Most of the women I fancy wear glasses but no one seems to have noticed that so I do deliberately get seen checking out non-glasses wearing women just make sure the balance of glasses to non-glasses seems about right. </p><p>I consider myself very lucky to have a beautiful and sexy girlfriend who wears (and needs) glasses. As I've said on Eyescene before, I'd still fancy her as much if she didn't wear glasses.  </p><p>Mark, you should also consider yourself very lucky that your wife understands your fetish and is happy to wear glasses she doesn't need for you. Several people on Eyescene have partners who wear glasses because they need them but I don't know if anyone else has a partner like your wife. May you both have a very long and happy marriage!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2014, 04:04</p><p>Little survey: Does your partner knows about your glasses fetish? How did she/he reacted when you told him/her about it? </p><p> </p><p>In my case, both my wife and I have perfect vision. She knows I love how she looks in glasses but the word "fetish" was never mentioned. </p><p>It all started years ago when we were dating. We were in her house where she lived with her parents and sister. Her sister wore -1,50 glasses and used to wear them when studying. </p><p>It was about 2 AM, my girlfriend and I were watching a movie in her house. I told her I had my sight a little tired and she replied that maybe I needed glasses. In the table near the couch were her sister's glasses so I took them and tried them on. My gf told me I looked funny, so I replied her to try them and she answered that her sister didn't want anyone to try her glasses. I said "come on!" and put them on her. I remember her saying that she thought the glasses were weaker. When she was going to remove them I told her I loved how she looks with them and asked her to leave them. We watched the movie till the end with my girlfriend wearing those glasses. The next times we were alone in her house she used to have fun wearing the glasses. After a few weeks I bought her some OTC readers. I remember her saying I was crazy but she liked them. </p><p>Since then, time has passed, we married, we have a collection of about 10 glasses and she sometimes wears them when we are alone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chad</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2013, 13:31</p><p>That's why progressives are so good. You don't have to slide the glasses down and your eyes and brain coordinate as to what part of the lens to look through. I think they were an inqenious invention.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2013, 12:00</p><p>Come to think of it, sliding your glasses down your nose can also help a person who wears plus glasses read also, again if the prescription is high enough.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2013, 11:54</p><p>Another thought.  Letting minus glasses slide down your nose has the same optical effect as wearing the dreaded bifocals to help you read, IF you have a significant MINUS prescription. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2013, 11:50</p><p>If your prescription is more than +/-5.00 vertex distance (the distance from your cornea to the back surface of your glasses) begins to play a role in the "effective" power of your glasses.  The magnitude of the effect is the square (^2) of the sphere prescription, though cylinder can come into play if it is over 5.00.  </p><p>When your glasses slide down your nose, you are increasing the vertex distance from the usual 12 mm or so, which is pretty close to the vertex distance for either trial lens frames or phoropters, you are DECREASING the effective power of your glasses if you wear minus lenses and INCREASING the effective power of your glasses if you wear plus lenses. </p><p>You can calculate the approximate power change by squaring the sphere power and dividing the result by 1000.  This number is the amount of the effective power decrease or increase per mm.  </p><p>For example, with Astra's -5.5 it would be (5.5 x 5.5 = 30.25 / 1000 = .03025) 0.030 x 20 mm or effectively 0.60 diopters LESS if the glasses slid down the nose 20 mm or -4.90 diopters.  With JD's -10.75 the effect is significantly greater because of the square function at work.  Here is the math.  10.75 x 10.75 = 115.5625 / 1000 = 0.116 per mm.  If JDs glasses slid down the nose 20 mm the effective power of the glasses would be -8.43 (0.116 x 20 = 2.32).   </p><p>Remember when doing the calculations the - or + on the prescription is lost and you have to reapply the correct sign on the final result.  Just apply the vertex distance effects to the original prescription as described above by DECREASING or INCREASING the number as appropriate. </p><p>BTW, this is the same calculation used for determining the difference between a refracted or glasses prescription and a Contact Lens prescription and the reason CL prescriptions are LOWER for minus prescriptions and HIGHER for plus prescriptions. </p><p>Probably more than you wanted to know, but there it is anyway.  Nothing mysterious going on, just optics at work. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>varifocals</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2013, 11:44</p><p>JD very true. </p><p>Much easier with minus lens too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JD</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2013, 10:09</p><p>Astra, I agree with you.  I really like to let my glasses slide down my nose often to notice things get blurry.  I find it very stimulating as well (I'm -10.75).  I wear my glasses fairly loose just so they will slide down.  I also like to see other people (women) that do the same.  Obviously the higher the Rx the better, as it is obvious to me how much different the acuity of their vision will be.  Fascinating!  </p><p></p><hr>

When we have lower rx we can have the lenses farther away and still see okay (maybe still 20/25 or 20/30) ... </p><p> </p><p>I have around -5.5 right now it is a lot more restricted (dependent) , even pulling the lenses 2 cm away the image are already noticeably distorting and shifting in position, with the acuity drops down to roughly 20/50 , and i can feel the lenses become a lot weaker by positioning it 2 cm away, or simply let it slide down and sits at the nose tip. </p><p> </p><p>We have seen in some slutty poses, gwg sliding their frame to the nose tip, or adjusting lenses deliberately..  </p><p> </p><p>but some gwg use low minus rx or plano lenses, most important is the image shift being very mild.  also the wearer can see more than 30 cm good enough without their glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>when the rx is higher we can have more image shift with the minus lenses.  </p><p> </p><p>onlookers may be unable to experience the feelings of the wearer. when the rx is higher even a slight push around the lenses the image would shift a lot, also with some peripheral distortion.  </p><p> </p><p>so that the gwg herself would feel like her vision are really distorting, when her glasses is shifted (either by herself or her partner) it is such a "massage" to her eyes. In my own experience I feel very stimulating, I feel surprised and excited, as if pulling my eyeballs away from and back to my body, and threatened to be back to the unfamiliar blur.  </p><p> </p><p>most people at such rx would not be familiar with the blur unless they spend a lot of time without glasses. it is such an emotional shock or stimuli ...</p><p></p><hr>

Yeah i'm sure her eyes were able to adjust to the glasses without any problem. By the end of each day i'm sure when she took them off everything was blurry at least for a while. At least she knows that if she wants to wear glasses her eyes can tolerate that much prescription, Maybe her friend will let her just keep the glasses if they are a past pair for her? </p><p>By the way what you witnessed happens quite often that someone likes the glasses that a friend is wearing and when that person gets new glasses will pass them on to her friend. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwg-lover</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2013, 17:30</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p>I think she wanted to look like her friend because she also wore the same kind of clothes like her.

It sounds like she kinda wanted to be able to wear glasses but didn't want family and other friends know of her desire?

If it has been a several years she is certainly due to get an exam. However it could be that since they are both myopic most people's eyes actually like being somewhat over corrected. So feeling like she could see better with her friend's glasses would be rather normal. My guess is it could be a little of both, your girlfriend may need a slight increase but probably not as much as her friend's glasses. The general rule is if it has been more than a year since her last exam she should get one.  </p><p></p><hr>

Her friend's were too strong she said, and the difference in prescription is material from I heard, but she felt she might still need a new eyetest.  </p><p> </p><p>I told her later in the evening that maybe her glasses are just fine for "very good and sufficient" vision, and slightly stronger lenses are always a plus but not strictly needed? Not that I don't want her to go for an eyetest, and maybe also change frames, which I look forward to, but she felt a bit let down by the fact she felt she had really better vision with someone else's stronger glasses than with her own.</p><p></p><hr>

But now that glasses have become much more of a fashion statement, for them it is not much different then comparing bags or shoes.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2011, 18:05</p><p>Emily </p><p>Sorry I just re-read your post. If you don't want to talk about it I understand. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2011, 18:03</p><p>Emily </p><p>Do you mean he was shocked in a good way or a bad way? What did you tell him? You said you told him you had a glasses fetish, but did you tell him that you not only have a thing for glasses on others but that you wear kinda strong glasses yourself when your not wearing your contacts? Well now for sure since you have really broken the even more than I thought you intended to. I am shocked that you went so far as to tell him you have a fetish. It seemed your biggest problem in life was letting him see you in your glasses for the first time. I got to ask, if you have a fetish, why do you wear contacts yourself and not your glasses. Do you think now that you told him he will wear his glasses to meet you?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2011, 16:08</p><p>The big day didn't come yet. But for reasons I don't want to talk about, he now knows about my fetish and my phobia. He is pretty shocked and I will meet him the first time after telling him about it this evening. So I will see how it goes. It will be weird for me too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2011, 16:43</p><p>Emily - my gf's contacts are disposables so sometimes she takes them out in the bathroom but sometimes she just removes them as she is getting into bed so she doesn't put on her glasses until morning. Just go for it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2011, 20:14</p><p>Emily your glasses are strong but not to a point of extreme. I have seen much stronger than that and the glasses still look very nice. I think you are making this much worse in your mind than it will be in reality. I don't know if you have regular lenses but maybe if you are this concerned get high index lenses and they will be much thinner.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2011, 16:37</p><p>Thank you so much for all your comments :). The big day is still to come, it might be this evening. I don't know yet if I will really stay.  </p><p>Of course I like the way he looks in glasses. To be honest I am getting crazy seeing him like this, and for sure all of you guys like girls/guys in glasses, too. All of us are here for the same reason ;). But I don't know if he is one of us, probably not. I am pretty sure that he feels self-concious about his glasses, so at least we have that part in common. </p><p>He knows that I wear contacts. At my home I sometimes go bare eyd to the bathroom, but I know my surroundings. Going bare eyed in an unfamiliar place might end up more embarassing than wearing glasses. So I will probably put the glasses on in the bathroom and face him with glasses. I know that only the first time will be weird and then it will be OK, hopefully. I will let you know how it goes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2011, 16:00</p><p>Emily, my gf has a similar prescription to you and always wears contacts. We had dated for a long while before she took them out in my presence even though I knew she wore them. She would sleep in them but then eventually she did takke them out and now she's fine about it. She looks great in glasses at bedtime. Do you go around bare-eyed at home at all ? My gf doesn't reach for her glasses to visit the bathroom !</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2011, 13:12</p><p>Emily, you will see that deciding how you will handle the situation will depend highly on how things will go that night. Fate and destiny are chaotic in nature. You will know what to do when the time comes. </p><p>From my personal experience, I can tell you that surprise is one of the sexiest things. I remember some years ago, when I started dating an (old now) girlfriend of mine. We had gone out with common friends 2 times and then we went out on a date another 2 times. I had never seen her with glasses, nor had she said anything about them. Everytime we kissed it was dark so I hadn't spotted the contacts and to be frank I wasn't trying to spot them. </p><p>So one night she invited me to her place. When we got in, we started kissing ad undressing and after a while, she went to the bathroom. A couple of minutes later she came out with no clothes at all but with her glasses on!  </p><p>I can tell you now, that glasses turned out to be a real turn on in that relationship. </p><p> </p><p>I hope everything goes as perfect as you will want to remember it years from now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2011, 12:13</p><p>Sorry Tom I re-read her post and she is in fact talking about what to do at bedtime. I'm sure she can get by okay for that.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2011, 11:41</p><p>Emily </p><p> </p><p>I may sound a tad old-fashioned (and I probably am!!) but your relationship and enjoyment of things together is far more important than the subject of wearing glasses. </p><p> </p><p>May I suggest that next time you see him wearing glasses, just say he looks great wearing glasses, would he like to see you wearing glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>I'll bet the answer will be a resounding 'yes' and you just pop your glasses and then see what happens!!!!!! </p><p> </p><p>Light the blur-touch paper and retire immediately!

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2011, 10:36</p><p>I figure Emily to take off her glasses once in his bf's house, just before going bed. I don't think she would have major troubles even with -7. Don't you think so?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2011, 09:40</p><p>Tom </p><p>Not so sure that would be a good idea for her. If she was around -2.00 or she could probably do what you suggest but she is -7.00 / -8.00 so without her contacts or glasses she is very limited on what she can see. That would likely be far more embarrising for her to do than wearing glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2011, 01:43</p><p>Emily: I'd suggest to take off your contacts and go bareeyed, with all the limitations these may have (getting closer, squint...) and see which is his reaction. On my own side I'd be really turned on by your way of doing bareyed. If it asks, just tell him you need some correction due to myopia and let him choose between glasses or ... nothing! ;-) </p><p>But maybe it is too late to give advices, perhaps the day was yesterday... just let us know!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2011, 00:20</p><p>Emily </p><p>I am sure he likes not just the you with contacts in, but the same you with glasses on. If he wears some correction he understands that needing strong glasses or weak ones like his is not something you can control. (well at least he doesn't know that some can) He may very well find you even more sexy with your glasses. I think you have nothing to worry about, besides you can't keep it from for too long anyway. Does he know you wear contacts? If he knows that he probably knows that without them you most likely would still need glasses full time anyway.  </p><p>Do let us know how it goes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2011, 22:07</p><p>We are always interested. </p><p>Put the glasses on and tell him about your fetish. </p><p>It will work wonders.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2011, 21:01</p><p>I am not exactly sure where to put this...maybe here. I am reading on Eye Scene for quite a while now. I am a girl with -7/-8 wearing contacts most of the time. I am feeling very self-concience wearing glasses. Now I am dating a guy and it's getting more serious coming to the point where I would stay at his home, taking off my contacts and have to face him wearing glasses. Uagh! The good thing is that he has glasses too, but with a very weak prescription, astigmatism with a bit plus. I saw him maybe three times wearing them for short moment. He would take them off eventually when he saw me. But he doesn't really need them to see, just to help him reading the computer screen. When I take my contacts off I don't see much more than a colorful blur. </p><p>We were talking about glasses once and he said "glasses are sexy". I didn't tell him what I am thinking about glasses *lol*. I told him that I have a fetish but not more specific about what is the "thing". </p><p>Tomorrow might be the big day. I will see. I don't know what to do yet. Taking the contacts off, going to bed blind or putting on my glasses. If somebody is interested, I will continue how it goes on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SZ6</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2011, 09:24</p><p>I'm not sure what thread this should go on, but this one may fit it best... </p><p> </p><p>Recently, I've had an interesting experience with glasses and online dating. A bit of background - I'm a -10 myope myself (mostly contacts, sometimes glasses) and very attracted to women with thick glasses/poor vision. In my online dating profile, I alluded to glasses/vision just twice. One part of the profile asks the user to share six things they can't do without. I put contacts/glasses as one of those, adding that I beat most people in the "worst eyesight" challenge. Another part of the profile asks the user what they are looking for in a match. Among many other attributes, I said that I like a woman who wears geeky, cute, thick glasses, even if it was just sometimes. </p><p> </p><p>Well, after having my profile live for a bit over a week, I've been contacted by no fewer than five cute, highly-myopic women, asking my prescription and curious to know how our eyes compare. Most of them only had pictures of themselves in contacts, and make no mention of glasses, contacts, or vision on their own profiles. But apparently those two little innocuous blurbs on mine drew their interest. </p><p> </p><p>I imagine those of you who do GOC could try a similar approach to meet women with bad eyes. It wouldn't be entirely honest, but it would probably work. By not being in-your-face about having a fetish, you make the topic of eyes and glasses easy and fun to discuss, which could lead to a steamier conversation if rapport and trust are present.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GOCer</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2011, 08:56</p><p>Fellow glasses fetishists, I'm trying to figure out:  Do you think our glasses fetish is a result of nature, or nurture?  I can't imagine we are born with a glasses fetish (nature).  If it's nurture, then, what kind of nurture, or experiences, created this glasses fetish?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glasses Lover</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2011, 04:03</p><p>Crystal Veil, </p><p> </p><p>Interesting comments.  </p><p> </p><p>The story about the UK postie is intriguing, though I'd never attempt such a thing. </p><p> </p><p>Like yourself, I also get a kick out of seeing women wearing very thick glasses. I've visited your blog several times. Alas, nowadays people wearing very thick glasses is not as common a sight as it used to be. The 1980's was to me the golden age of thick glasses. Frames were large and the lenses were so thick (in the days before high index lenses). </p><p> </p><p>Beyond this, our interests diverge. I love the glasses themselves. Even as a child I had an attaction to women's glasses. A sexual attraction. My mother was myopic and wore glasses, which while not extremely thick, were what I called 'within range'. In other words, they turned me on. I also used to lick her glasses. In my teens my 'fetish' only increased. And it's still with me - big time. </p><p> </p><p>All I ask is that while all this is unusal and some may say 'wierd', that people don't judge me too harshly. I believe that society 'makes' us to a point, but we're born the way we are.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal veil</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2011, 05:49</p><p>glasses lover@ </p><p> </p><p>for me the attraction the combination of a lady and her minus glasses, but admittedly there is something special about very strong minus glasses. Perhaps in my case rather curiosity about how the combination with their owner might have looked. As a child I beleived that glasses were something magic. </p><p> </p><p>Your question reminds me of a short article in a newspaper, some thirty years ago, about the arrest of a postman in the UK. He ripped the glasses from the face of a pretty woman and ran away with them. It was his uniform that led to his arrest after half a dozen thefts. </p><p> </p><p>Another remarkable phenomenon occurred some ten years back when I had a relation with a lady who was psychic. I think what she did was called psychometry. When she was handed an object she had never seen before - so nothing about its history was known to her - she "received" all sorts of vivid images related to the object and she was usually right! This worked in particular with watches and glasses, perhaps because of the skin contact that once existed with their first owner. Sometimes I handed to her some remarkable glasses from my collection. I knew nothing about their first owner and it was quite interesting to hear about the images that ran into her head. E.g. she could describe in full detail a dress that the first owner wore and that the lady had a passion for horticulture, especially roses. It was not a sexual thing in her case (she hated her own glasses) but a strong effect along different lines. Glasses are mysterious objects! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2010, 18:05</p><p>Katy, I have never forgotten that moment.  The sheepish look in his eyes through the lenses of those glasses was magic.  Of course he already had my heart before that, but after that moment he owned my soul.  That was the beginning of a very slippery slope for me.  I have only in the past few years realized the power that the "eyes behind the lenses" can have on me.  It is an unfair advantage.  Truly and totally unfair.   </p><p> </p><p>I don't know what that man (actually a boy at the time-early 20ish) thought he was going to see reflected back at him in my eyes when he looked up.  Perhaps he thought I might reject him as deeply flawed?  I'm not sure.  I wonder what he saw reflected back?  Surely something that no man ever saw there before or since.  Any moment even approaching that is dim in comparison.  Thinking back I assume that he felt he was revealing his deepest secret.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2010, 15:00</p><p>VFL, I always remember when I was in the 6th form at school and going out with a gorgeous guy who was in the year above. After we had been together a while I saw that he had contacts (I thought he had an eyelash in his eye and then realised), and I was incredibly excited about this, although neither of us ever mentioned it. Then one day he came to pick me up in the evening and when we got in his car he pulled out a pair of (-3/4?) glasses and said 'I suppose I better put these on so we don't crash'.

I do wear a daily over correction of  -4.50 and when I do an at home vision test it is about 20/500 when I take the glasses off,especially after close work. </p><p>  Are you a GWG,and if so what is your vision,and prescription?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2010, 07:43</p><p>I have always found it to be a very intimate moment when a man "confesses" to me what his uncorrected eyesight is like. The first time for me was back in college. My boyfriend and I had just slept together for the first time. He was a confirmed contacts wearer and I had never seen him in his glasses before. The next morning he came out of the bathroom wearing a pair of very strongish horn rims and sheepishly said, "Now you see how blind I really am."  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Unforgettable. </p><p> </p><p>Anyone else have any similar stories? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Do you bring the glasses to bars and take them out as a conversation starter? What do you say to these people to get them to try the glasses on, and let you take pictures of them? </p><p> </p><p>Thanks!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2010, 00:02</p><p>High minus lenses (non-hi index) is the only way to go, since they are so much thicker. So much more enjoyable licking very thick lenses. I have a few pairs that are between 12 to 15 centimetres thick. The frames are very large too, which makes the experience so much more enjoyable. Heaven! It isn't the same with the piddly little frames that are all the rage now. </p><p> </p><p>Let's hope big frames make a comeback. I mean big, like the early 1980s. </p><p> </p><p>Guys, which is your favourite side of the lenses to lick? I personally prefer the back of the lenses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>OnLooker</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2009, 01:14</p><p>I have just bought online and received two pairs of reading glasses, very "glamour" and sexy tfor my wife to wear and play with while preserving her prescription ones designer, expensive...she is all thje time worried to break them so...not very practicla for those moments!! The thing is that she's wearing +1 with -0.25 astygmatism and the readers i have bought are +1.5..just to add some power to the lenses...I hope she'll cope with them and be able to use them for reading other than for other stuff!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2009, 02:39</p><p>I find wearing glasses can be stimulating.  </p><p> </p><p>Looking at a small TV screen with glasses on, under low ambient light conditions, cast me some thought.  </p><p> </p><p>The TV screen lighten up the lenses, causing the reflection of my lenses on their edges. When I look at the screen I can look at the reflection of the lenses as well. The reflection of the lenses is beautiful, also giving an idea the lenses are actually thick, thicker than it seems than when the lenses are not lighten up.  </p><p> </p><p>I find the phenomenon interesting, even though I have wore glasses for more than 10 years. The reflection looks like freely elliptical tracks, giving a feeling of fast-moving objects. </p><p> </p><p>When the glasses are sliding down, you realise you are so lucky with your glasses on... that you realise your vision without is actually a blur. Do not being too rushed to pull your glasses back, have a look at the blur and compare to the corrected image, that is exactly stimulating as well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2009, 16:14</p><p>My girlfriend stayed at my place during the weekend and I had asked her to bring her spare pair of glasses with her. She knows I like seeing her with her glasses and switching between pairs and she could not say no. Last night she left and forgot her spare pair, so tonight I found the opportunity to try them on while being alone. Although they are only -3 I must admit it was a bit difficult after the first 5 minutes. I started to get a bit dizzy and even more when I tried to watch TV. Shaving was a problem too. And washing the remaining shaving foam off my face, ended up in hitting the glasses quite a few times and getting the lenses wet. But the feeling of the frames sliding down the nose and having to adjust them all the time felt so good...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mike</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2009, 15:44</p><p>Hi Anni, </p><p>I think it`will be quite better to get glasses with -5 diopters you start with. After wearing some weeks you change to glasses with -6 and so on. I think you have to wear them every day, every hour, every minute. </p><p>I have a friend who did the same to become nearsighted, and it works. But the difficult thing was to start. The way from non prescription to -1 takes over six month. Good luck. </p><p>Mike</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2009, 23:16</p><p>And - I used to hate discussions about eyesight too but I seem to have got over that. Children are so unkind aren't they? What happened, did the girl get glasses while she was still in your class?  </p><p> </p><p>I got sort of fed up with people pointing things out and not being able to see them and I guess even as adults many people go through that if they are, like I was, in a situation where they start wearing glasses relatively late (ie in their 20s). That's the dilemma really - if you can see alot but not some of the detail, should you wear your glasses fulltime? I have a friend whos -2 max and he always does. </p><p> </p><p>As to whether I feel okay in public if I'm not wearing my glasses, well yes because I'd never do anything like drive without them, and though finding my way in somewhere large like an airport would be difficult, most other things would be possible.

At first she didnt understand the fetish as she had never known anybody with a glasses fetish but after reading about it a bit not only understands it but really has no problems with it either.We have goofy nick nemes for them as well, I must say i feel truly blessed to have a loving wife who understands this and willingly participates in it as well. Some times when she is feeling frisky we go to dinner and hit the local lenscrafters or wal-mart vision center so she can model for me. We have known each other since kindergarten. So I have to rub it in eat your hearts out!! :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jojo</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2009, 11:00</p><p>my husband looks so sexy in his glasses he wore them in bed the first night we slept together it was amazing i have never enjoyed it so much in my life! i wanted a boyfriend with glasses for years before i met him but was never lucky enough before he has recently switched from wearing contacts nearly full time to glasses so im in heaven right now as i never thought he would do this</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2008, 03:28</p><p>Congrats, thats an amazing story! Usually the myopia people have their sweet story of needing to be closer to their bf/gf etc in order to see but it's good that see that farsighted people have theirs as well :D</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>pursuit of happiness</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2008, 02:21</p><p>I still can't believe it. first of all, I'm a bit farsighted (+2.00 in both eyes with some astigmatism). I usually wear my glasses for reading, tv, computer, sometimes also the whole day, but usually not, because it's not like i don't see anything without glasses. </p><p>A few months ago I got to know my new girlfriend. she saw my glasses but never questioned why i woudn't wear them full time or anything. a few nights ago we were making out and between kissing she noticed that i had my eyes open but was squeezing because her face was so close that i couldn't see anything....(being farsighted)...i told her so.... so she suggested that i wear my glasses (!!!!)...oh my god! thank YOU, lord and thank YOU, girlfriend! you can imagine what happended after making out a bit....i never had sex in my glasses before...it was the best sex ever (ok, let's say top 10) and even she admitted (with a rather embarrassed but quite kinky smile) that she was totally turned on by it because she never had had a bespectacled boyfriend before and that my glasses would make me look so innocent...go figure! now every once in a while i'll be wearing my glasses during sex, i'll be able to see her beautiful face while kissing and i'll be having a blast. mission pursuit of happiness accomplished!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2008, 08:17</p><p>Lentifan, </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for the compliment.  I have 30 pairs of plastic frames, in drop-temples, cat's-eyes, and other large frames.  The lenses are 2-3 inches in diameter, and the thickness is from 1/4 to 1/2 inch, depending on frame size, and obviously thicker towards the outsides. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2008, 12:43</p><p>I never wear hats, only the hood of my coat if it's raining or snowing but not hard enough to use my umbrella.  I have no problem showing my -9.00 thick-lensed glasses (with no tints) to the world.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>OttO</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2008, 12:31</p><p>Interesting observation about hats.  It never occurred to me that hats would obscure glasses although I wear both hats and glasses.  Either caps or brimmed hats are great for protecting glasses from rain and snow, and for keeping one from banging glasses against windows, door frames, etc. </p><p> </p><p>There is something of a renaissance of hat wearing among both men &amp; women.  Everybody wears ball caps these days and some people just get tired of them and move on to regular hats.  However, hat wearing will probably never extend to the majority.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2008, 16:32</p><p>Jennifer, the ladies I have in mind have been much higher than that.  Perhaps in the -10 to -20 range and at least one with tinted lenses.  But it's hard to be sure because you can't see them properly - which is, I think, the objective.  Very frustrating for OO's like me</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2008, 15:47</p><p>That's interesting what you say about the hat trying to disguise the fact of strong glasses.  I noticed this mostly in men.  There is one guy, who happens to run the gym I go to.  When I first met him, he was wearing a baseball cap to conceal the fact that he wore glasses (strong glasses had nothing to do with it).  His baseball cap was pulled very low over his eyes.  Later I saw him again, without glasses, obviously in contacts.  I estimated his glasses to be around -4 range.  I have seen him several times and every time he wears his glasses, the baseball cap is pulled low over his eyes. Very interesting....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2008, 15:18</p><p>I normally reckon I have a keen eye for the flash of a strong lens, but I have been frustrated a few times recently by women wearing broad brimmed hats or caps which prevent you from getting a proper look at their glasses. Is this a coincidence?  I think not.  One (non-)sighting was in a supermarket; she wasn't likely to get wet nor the sun in her eyes.  I assume it was to disguise some strong lenses.  Anyone else noticed this phenomenon?  Is it becoming a fashion? </p><p> </p><p>I hope not</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ES-Visitor</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2007, 00:03</p><p>Thanks mate, great advice, I'll definitely  stick to it. The problem is that I have to keep a certain balance and not make compliments only when she wears glasses otherwise she'll start thinking I only like her when she does... It did happen before... Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>cut-in UK</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2007, 14:37</p><p>ES Visitor, it's important you tell your wife how attractive she looked when she came to pick you up. Don't mention the glasses directly, but tell her every time you see her wearing them. She'll get used, subconsciously, to the fact that good things happen when she wears them. This may reduce the resistance to glasses that she might feel.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ES-Visitor</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2007, 00:44</p><p>Oh yes she does especially when she atsrts wearing her glasses.

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2007, 06:53</p><p>She sounds kind of like me. That was my first prescription and it hasn't changed much since. I was told "don't wear them all the time or you'll start to need them,  just for reading or when your eyes get tired". However I was wearing them all the time soon enough just for the astigmatism part. Over time the astigmatism part has gotten worse and the + has gone up and come down again. </p><p> </p><p>Your wife sounds hot though :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gwen</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2007, 15:00</p><p>Thought I'd write a little under this thread because I realise now glasses ARE sexy. I've just been away for a week (on my own, sad I know but I like to get away by myself from time to time) and I've met a rather gorgeous man. Not only is he gorgeous but he's 8 years my junior. Anyway, it wasn't until near the end of my stay that we started sleeping together and I found out he wears glasses, incredibly strong ones at that, at least as strong as mine. I know I should have noticed the contacts in his eyes but I didn't, probably because my corrected near vision is very poor but these glasses have come as a revelation. I feel I've found a kindred spirit for one thing but more than that I find the fact that he needs these things to see very sexy indeed. I'm starting to see what you people find so alluring about myopia.</p><p></p><hr>

He was OK about it and let me keep them in my bag. I always carry my contacts with me anyway in case of emergencies with my glasses. He's a harmles guy I think, a wealthy business man who likes to tie up with me when he's in London. He usually takes me to fancy restaurants and lets me keep my glasses to read the menu, then I take them off and maybe leave them on the table, he loves to see me squinting at him but it doesn't really help me to see any better. When we leave he likes me to leave my specs off. We've been to a club and a casino and believe me I'm almost blind in dark places so I have to hang onto him. Then we go back to his hotel and the glasses stay off till morning. It is very hard and I do tend to get headaches straining to see things. I just have to remember it's a job and I'm getting paid extra to do this! Hope that answers your questions.  </p><p> </p><p>Leanne xx " </p><p> </p><p>  I was curious as to what your vision would be like.

To be trite that made people disappear! What a blur. I had no idea what was on the store shelves. And I did this only briefly not for hours on end as you did in an environment unfamiliar to you. </p><p>   You are one gutsy lady; I'm happy nothing untoward happened to you apart from a headache. </p><p>   Do you have other stories/experiences to share with Eye Scene readers? </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

That's a line that OO's have to draw, would you be just as interested in them if they didn't have frames + rx that drive you nuts. If not thing to do is to pass.  </p><p> </p><p>IMO its a blessing to have *something* that excites you and also helps to draw your interest but liking someone just for their glasses or poor vision is the same trap as guys getting in just for a nice figure or rack.

<p><b>cut-in UK </b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2007, 23:58</p><p>I believe this is about how men see women, and (less frequently because of psychological differences between men and women), vice versa. O-O's consider glasses enhance ANY woman. They are a specific essential to the many facets that defines their perfect woman. </p><p> </p><p>To some men, women are a 'package' of atributes counting towards desirability, the last word being the important one. Women however are lit by the flame of attraction first, and desire afterwards. Where would we be though, without the obvious insight of say Clare,(sorry to pick a 'name') but she seems to possess the intellect and understanding of a mature (yes I mean 'older') person. Clearly she wears glasses but having never met her I don't know whether she fits your 'librarian' stereotype. Is she deemed attractive only because she wears glasses or do we equally admire her intelligence as another of the many facets of her overall personality. This is the real test, not of the girls, but of the men that clearly seek to judge them. Interesting stuff eh ! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2007, 11:20</p><p>Probably two trains of thought here. </p><p> </p><p>I was thinking, there are a lot of guys they say they like the "sexy librarian" look but how many really like the librarian look or just girls in glasses. From what I've seen, a LOT of guys like gwgs, or maybe that's just on the internet ;) but it's always been more socially acceptable to like a sexy librarian than to say you have a thing for glasses. I know I've said sexy librarian a few times to avoid seeming weird. </p><p> </p><p>Well I realised the other day that aside from the glasses I'm not much into the librarian look at all. I'm not a fan of the hair pulled up or bun thing and it accomplishes exactly what most women who do it aim for, looking less attractive and more "serious and professional" which is a load of bollocks really. The problem is with guys who take women less seriously or assume they're whores just because they would rather dress attractively. It's the responsibility of the guys to treat them with respect, not theirs to "dress appropriately". I don't get guys a lot of the time, imo it's a bonus when this happens so why discourage it, and worse make her feel upset about it. But anyway getting off topic. Nothing gets me more than hair down with glasses or "fuck me hair" RAWR! :D</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sue</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2007, 08:56</p><p>They should not slip down her nose if they are fitted correct, i would find that very annoying have to keep pushin up my glasses.

<p><b>Glen</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2007, 03:28</p><p>gloworm, In response to your wuestion, My girlfriend has a pair of glasses for work and sports that fit well and she isnnot bothered with them slipping..However they look very industrial. Her dress glasses are sexy black plastic ones but like I said they constantly slip. I realy think she likes it when I push them up for heror the feeling of helplessness when they slide off her face.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2007, 23:11</p><p>I can't remember definitively but I don't recall seeing much if any rx in them. Maybe they might have been just for looks. </p><p> </p><p>There was a blonde girl a season or two ago, didnt seem that bright but had a low minus pair that she wore only just to meetings where she put on her "smart face" along with them. I shook my head whenever she did that ;)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>apprentice fan</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2007, 19:55</p><p>I missed the episode but found videos and pics online...if Stefani is just 32, what's the need for readers like that down her nose? In the video she was speaking on a script for tourists... this isn't heavy reading w/small print or anything like that... should not be too hard for a young farsighted person to get around without their glasses... unless... </p><p> </p><p>maybe she is actually quite farsighted... then shouldn't she keep them on to help with distance? </p><p> </p><p>or could it be that maybe presbyopia has set in with or without hyperopia?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glowworm</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2007, 12:19</p><p>Socks: As long as it concerns low RXs, I agree to you. Concerning high RXs I agree to what Brille said. With high RXs, it is important to have the glasses fixed properly to see well. The lower the RX, the easier the getting along with sliding glasses, I think.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Socks</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2007, 12:04</p><p>I absolutely LOVE when a girl lets her glasses slide down her nose or wears them lower on her nose.  Something extra sexy about it.  I think it's partly due to the fact that the girl has to be conscious of her glasses, and with a little effort, could probably remedy it but chooses not too.  I think that alone is really sexy and the sign of at least a partial OO. </p><p> </p><p>Not one to advocate online porn, but a girl that was introduced to me on this site is a porn "actress" that goes by the name Eva Angelina.  If you search a bit you can find lots of photos and video of her and her glasses are constantly either sliding down or near the end of her nose and she chooses to leave them there for the most part.  This drives me crazy! (In a good way.)  Sometimes she looks over the top of them, which I don't like so much, but for the most part in the video sequences I've seen, she'll simply tilt her head back a bit rather than push her glasses up.  Hottest thing ever!  That's the look that I tend to really go for, but it's rare.  Any thoughts?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2007, 04:46</p><p>I should also add that Stefani has a very Sophie Marceau quality to her. To me she is the "older woman", but in a very good way. Definitely the type I like.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2007, 04:43</p><p>Hey guest, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for the gwg tip on the Apprentice this last week. They actually have the full episode online for this one so you can all see what he was talking about :)  </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180717081313/http://apprentice.tv.yahoo.com/trump/06/episodes/week3.html" target="_blank">http://apprentice.tv.yahoo.com/trump/06/episodes/week3.html</a> </p><p> </p><p>I've found that the best looking girls this season aren't the ones with the best headshots it seems. Stefani is definitely alluring and commanding with the readers. At the same time I kept wanting to see what she looked like wearing them properly as opposed to on the tip of her nose. There is Kristine, who is the only proper "out" gwg there, lots of frame styles. Seemingly a different one every week. She could be one of us! The other one is Nicole, she's a little more average looking but seems to be a full time gwg whenever she's not having camera closeups. Her glasses are well chosen and do a LOT ofr her.  </p><p> </p><p>There are also a couple of guys too for you ladies. There's a blonde chap by the name of Aaron who is seen in myopic rx ovals in the morning and I think I spotted some specs on that James bloke. Quite a lot of good looking girls this season (another one is Heidi), something which I think they've done delibrately because of ratings. Ivanka has also taken over Carolyn's job and she looks spectacular. </p><p> </p><p>I was planning to skip this season but now I'm reconsidering :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brille</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2007, 04:26</p><p>I have never understood this cliché of thick glasses sliding down the nose. Strong powers should be fitted correctly as close to the eyes as possible.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glowworm</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2007, 03:56</p><p>glenn: Isn't it annoying for her if her glasses keep sliding down her nose? Does she get along with that? Wouldn't it be better for her to get smaller frames with high-index lenses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glenn</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2007, 13:05</p><p>Hi Sue, my girlfriend wears about -20 glasses .She cannot see without them. I think they make her look even more attractive than what she is even if they are very thick.She has a hard time keeping them in place because they are so thick andthey keep sliding down her nose.I actually think it is sexy when she has to fidget with her glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ipml</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2007, 07:18</p><p>No cut off for me Sue. The higher the minus Rx the better. So don't worry about getiing more myopic, there lots of guys out there who love GWGs with thick glasses, especially as they are hard to come by these days, what with cls, lasik, etc...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2007, 15:56</p><p>I cannot conceive any lenses that would be so strong as to make them unatractive.  Lenticulars and myodiscs -so rarely seen in real life these days - are a particular turn-on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Steve</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2007, 15:14</p><p>Sue, for me the cut-off is not strength but thickness: about 6-7mm (1/4in). Frames are important also: as long as they "match" the face, different styles go with different faces!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2007, 10:35</p><p>Sue, </p><p>I think your prescription is just about perfect, since it's almost identical to mine. I'm -11.50 R and  </p><p>-15.00 L with a little bit of astigmatism. And I don't think there's any "cut-off" point at all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sue</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2007, 09:55</p><p>wow, what a nice response. Makes having to wear strong glasses a lot easier, thanks guys xxx</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carl</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2007, 08:25</p><p>Sue: </p><p>to answer your question, I love thick minus glasses on girls but I don't like myodisks, which turn me off.  So go ahead and get as nearsighted as you like but please don't get myodisks.  (I assume that at your relatively low prescription, your lenses are either plano or doubly concave.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>benn</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2007, 07:19</p><p>The thicker the better, either plus or minus, love multi focus!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2007, 06:06</p><p>No cut off for me either. It's the helplessness that comes with higher prescriptions which is one of the attractions.  Another is the fact that glasses with well chosen frames and a high minus draw my attention to her eyes, but the lenses prevent me seeing what her eyes actually look like.  Only when the glassses come off can I see what she really looks like.  That transition is an extremely erotic moment for me.:)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Charles</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2007, 05:29</p><p> </p><p>Sue </p><p>There is no cut off point as far as I am concerned. But as a very high myope myself, maybe I am biased.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2007, 05:18</p><p>As far as I am concerned the lenses MUST be minus (I find plus lenses positively unattractive),but providing the girl has perfectly healthy eyes and can see perfectly wearing glasses the thicker the better:) Although really I am very much a 'frames' man. Especially blondes wearing black rectangular plastic frames with wide sides:)Providing the lenses are minus, it doesn't make any difference whether the lenses are minus 1 or minus 20, though high minus has it's own attraction. But there is certainly no 'cut-off point'. Really thick minus lenses are soooooooooooooo cool - none of this 'hi-index' rubbish:) Pete </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sue</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2007, 03:35</p><p>Interesting question for you guys. At what rx do glasses stop being sexy. As a high minus wearer myself, (R-11.25 L-14.00 with -2 astig in both eyes) i get lots of comments from boyfriends about my glasses. Most are positive and once they know how helpless i am without them understand. But i have had others that have said, why cant you go out without them, or cant you get thinner lenses, (I have hi-index) </p><p>It struck me that lots of guys like girls in glasses, but there seems to be cut off point, when they reach a certain rx, their conceptions change. It may be just me, but any thoughts on the subject would be welcome</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Steve</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2007, 15:36</p><p>I came home early from work today. </p><p>My girlfriend was in the kitchen, she'd just come back from a jogging, had showered, and was still in her bathrobe. To my delight she wore her glasses, which she always keeps in the car, as she tried to follow a sitcom playing on the TV on the other side of the room while cooking. </p><p> </p><p>The man-woman action kicked off quickly and for the first time we made love while she had only her glasses on. She didn't seem to mind or simply forgot to put them off? Anyway, she's only -2.50 in each eyes, but it was a great turn-on for me, which I'd never dared to tell her but often dreamed of! Maybe her eyesight is worsening as she never used her glasses for watching TV before tonight?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2007, 05:15</p><p>How hot is Stefani wearing her glasses on The Apprentice?  She seems so comfortable wearing her readers for the whole show this week.  With two other girls wearing glasses as well.  It's turning into a GWG show.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Slit</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2007, 03:00</p><p>Naughty Librarian.... ah !!! i love that idea!! </p><p> </p><p>There can be 3 possibilities, </p><p> </p><p>1. Your girlfriend is Hyperopic: </p><p> </p><p>In this case, she will find that the +1 glasses can be worn by her without discomfort. However, if you make her wear -1 glasses, what she see through -1 will be horrible and she will hate the idea of wearing them. </p><p> </p><p>2. She is Myopic: </p><p> </p><p>Here, -1 will comfort her while +1 will annoy her. </p><p> </p><p>3. 100% Perfect sight: </p><p> </p><p>She might resist both, but there is a good probability that she can be induced to wear +1 if you manage it with good skill and care. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Best thing is keep 2 pairs with you, one +1 and another -1, make her wear each on 2 different days while playing sexy librabian... ask her when she is relaxed which of the glasses made her more comfortable! Then you can guess what suits her the best. </p><p> </p><p>Good Luck!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DWV</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2007, 02:53</p><p>Lovesglasses: </p><p>a couple of ideas... take her along with you when you go shopping for glasses for yourself, and suggest she try some frames on.  If the store happens to have free sight testing, chances are incredibly good they'll write some kind of prescription, even if it's very low.  Almost nobody has absolutely perfect eyesight....    </p><p>Get a pair of +1 readers and persuade her to try them for reading or the computer when she's tired, or to play "naughty librarian".</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2007, 01:02</p><p>Katy, Do I count as a "Welsh Eyescener"? I thought you were a Yorkshire lass! I think that there are more myopic gwgs in London than elsewhere. Partly a fashion thing, partly the higher concentration of young educated types, and partly the need to be able to see to get around such a complex place! But when you do get a Welsh myopic gwg they beat others hands down. I know a lawyer in the Assembly, who lives near you, and is as close to perfection as reality allows: long auburn hair, a beautiful accent and black plastic frames with about -3 lenses. She is the thing of dreams.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>cut-in UK </b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2007, 23:17</p><p>Oscar, at your first meeting, she didn't quite have that 100% confidence although she obviously suspected your leanings. She just needed to know that you adore the way SHE looks, but clearly her glasses are the icing on the cake. Now you have her full confidence and this relationship has clearly developed both the way she feels about herself and also she  thinks, 'this is the way he likes me to look.' A good result for two kindred spirits and further evidence for my 'myope affinity theory'.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>oscar</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2007, 17:59</p><p>I thought it had taken me a while to convince my girlfriend that I thought she was at her sexiest when wearing her little gold-rimmed minus 10 (hi-index) glasses - and she's often said since that she's very happy about this (which is wonderful as far as I'm concerned) and she is even wearing them more now. But I hadn't fooled her: she said the other day that she knew from the look on my face the first time I ever saw her in glasses that I obviously found them incredibly attractive  - and she didn't have any problem with that, in fact she was pleased. So in my case, it's worked out rather well. I guess the fact that we both have fairly abominable vision probably helped. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2007, 17:46</p><p>Canada?  That's what he says... The smart money's on the Filthy-man. ;)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2007, 13:36</p><p>Dear Cut-In,  Thanks for the compliment.  I take it as such! </p><p> </p><p>Katie,  I can guarantee that I could get him talking about the photo and have him taking off his own glasses and handing them to me and practically begging me to try them on within 5 maybe 10 minutes.   </p><p> </p><p>You know why it would be easy for me?  Because I don't have anything invested in him.  When it's somebody you are attracted to personally, it takes on a whole different meaning. </p><p> </p><p>I've started complimenting people on their glasses.  A great conversation starter is, "I really like your glasses.  Where did you get those frames?"  It's amazing how pleased of a reaction I get from people.  Then I just go into, "I'm wearing my contacts now, but I'm due for a new pair of glasses and want something cool like those."   </p><p> </p><p>People just open up.  I've found out about some really funky cool opticians that way. </p><p> </p><p>Don't ask him about the picture if that is outside of your comfort zone.  Everybody is different.  Sometimes it's fun to have a little mystery... </p><p>But if he's one of the guys from this board I think he should "fess up" right this very minute!!!! </p><p> </p><p>Maybe it's Filthy McNasty?!

<p><b>cut-in UK</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2007, 13:49</p><p>Don't run yourself down Lentifan; what you describe are merely preferences, you are no more abnormal than those preferring blondes to brunettes. It's all matter of degree. As long as your preference is consistent and not  extreme, you are not crossing the line from normality. We're all here because our obsession is related to optics rather than shoes, cars or leather clothing. Also, we're all quite different; if you read the threads, we're quite a mixed bunch. Remember, variety is the spice of life, and rarely , if ever, does anyone openly disrespect another persons opinion. Keep it coming, and all those 'lurkers' out there; be bold, go ahead and post! If you have a relevant opinion, your contribution is valued. That is what keeps the interest going. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2007, 13:43</p><p>Katy - tell us some more about the picture of a pair of glasses. Indeed, what can that be about?

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2007, 12:53</p><p>What you've all been describing seem pretty mild doses of the OO disease  compared to mone.  For me the ideal Rx is 'as high as possible' and, it will not surprise you to know, the lowest index possible. </p><p>I find high plus just as erotic as high minus.  A lady who would otherwise not interest me can look highly attractive, to put it no higher, when wearing glasses with a really high Rx.  I remember from many years ago a girl who was very tall and thin, with a stoop and no discernable bosom.  She wore no make-up and didn't spend any time on her dark hair. But her long face was made gorgeous by black plastic frames with glorious myodisc lenses (she must have been well into the -20s).  To me she was a fascinating creature. </p><p>I can't be normal, because I find models wearing plano or near plano lenses boring and no turn on at all.  It takes a little imperfection to make them pretty but human, complemented by a well chosen pair of glasses with a decent prescription, to make a girl attractive.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2007, 09:19</p><p>All4Eyes - I love your logic! I have just had to go and see my old tutor, who would be 'interesting' without glasses, but wears something like -9s, so on your scale he becomes 'scorching', which is a very accurate description. He has just got new glasses with very similar frames (dark plastic - mmmm), so I am guessing his rx went up :-) I talked to him for a while but got all hot and flustered - I'm sure he can tell. Although I am happy with my boyfriend, I have had dreams of going to his house, which I feel a bit guilty about. He has a picture of a pair of glasses on his wall too - what is that all about? Sometimes I wish I could switch off my OO-ness for a while, and then I could go to his classes without getting all over-excited and spending half an hour choosing what to wear, and then being late. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2007, 15:38</p><p>I've been thinking about a way to show how a persons' bespectaclednes (is that a word?) affects my perception of how attractive he/she is, so I made a sort of chart or scale showing how different specs affect me. As a baseline, I tend to look at everyone (the g-factor notwithstanding) as being, in ascending order- </p><p> </p><p>1. Uninteresting </p><p>2. Interesting </p><p>3. Attractive </p><p>4. Hot </p><p> </p><p>Now, a +/- 3 or under (on most anyone) or even (on someone whos face is especially well suited to them) just my favorite frames (big, black horn rims 50s style) moves one up a notch on my scale, everyone is at least interesting and an already hottie (without specs) becomes scorching. </p><p>A +/- 3-6 moves one 2 places up, so everyones attractive, the attractive-to-begin-withs are scorching and the hotties are boiling.  </p><p>With a +/- 6-10 most anyone is hot to me, at least, going  </p><p>1. Hot </p><p>2. Scorching </p><p>3. Boiling </p><p>4. Blistering </p><p>At +/- 10-20 we have </p><p>1. Scorching </p><p>2. Boiling </p><p>3. Blistering </p><p>4. Subnuclear </p><p>And from +/-20 on I am completely melted by the persons intense optical power and rendered helpless and stupefied (anybody else remember the Nickelodeon carton Doug where Doug had a superhero alter ego named Quailman who would give villains the Quail Eye?)! Well, actually, this last is strictly theoretical, as Ive never actually met anyone with this high an rx, but if I did, Im sure thats how Id feel. Ive come pretty close with a few Subnuclears! </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>shawnhoteyes</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2006, 00:57</p><p> This may be a bit off, but i guess this is the best place to ask this. Have anybody had an occurance where they were stalked by a OO? There was this young lady who got obsessed with me, and I can't explain why. I'm pretty blind without my glasses, but I can't tell if it was my glasses or not. She was very pretty, but I did not know her. She would drive and park across the street from my friends house after I had been there for a while, and sometimes acoss the street from my own home. At times I would see her far off as if she was hoping I would not be able to see her that far away. Never got a chance to talk to her. The only way I caught on was my friends told me what she was doing!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;24 Sep 2006, 03:52</p><p>I don't think I'll ever try to persuade her into doing GOC. She, like me, seems to like glasses because of the frames and not  cause of the power of the lenses. We both love glasses because of the interaction with them. Of course a low minus prescription would be a plus, because she would be dependable by glasses, but I don't care much about it. </p><p>Furthermore if she purchases glasses with plain glass lenses, I can wear them too, without having headaches. And that's a plus, especially during sex...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2006, 09:15</p><p>I've been dating a girl for about a month now. From the first couple of  days of our relationship, I asked her if she wore contacts or glasses, just  to find out if she was a GWG. Unfortunately for me, she told me she had absolutely no eyesight problem and her vision was perfect. Nevertheless I  really liked her and kept on dating her. </p><p>After the first week, our relationship became more intimate and we really  fell in love with each other. One day, half a month ago, we went for a  coffee at the morning on a very sunny day. That day I found out she had in  her purse two pairs of expensive sunglasses. After asking her why she had  two pairs, I received the most intriguing answer. After hesitating a bit,  she told me that since she was a teenager she had a fetish with glasses and  that since she couldn't get prescription glasses, due to her perfect  eyesight, she started buying sunglasses! </p><p>Of course I was really happy hearing that, but I tried not to show my full  enthusiasm. After starting a conversation about her fetish, I found out she  had a pair of sunglasses whose frames were meant for prescription glasses,  but she decided to transform them to sunglasses. Immediately I tried to  persuade her to put plain glass to the frames and restore them to their  original purpose. I was really surprised when I heard her saying that she  was thinking about that already! Of course I told her I looked forward to  seeing her wearing her "prescription" glasses. That morning we ended up  having the most amazing sex with her wearing the one pair of sunglasses  after the other. </p><p>One week later we went on a small trip. While we started making love in the  hotel room, she told me she had a surprise for me. She went into the  bathroom with her purse and when she came out, she was completely naked and  the only thing she wore was a pair of dark purple plastic square rimmed  glasses with wide arms and plain glass lenses! I will leave out the  details, saying only that we didn't go out of the room that whole day and  she wore her glasses for almost all day. I persuaded her to wear them next  day too when we went out and she really seemed to be enjoying it, playing  tricks with her glasses... She lowered them with her fingers and looked at  me from above the rims, she took them off and licked the side arms, etc.  She even took them off and put them on my nose and dragged me to the hotel  room to have sex! </p><p>Until now she still wears them when we meet, and she has told me she wants  to buy another pair to switch between the two of them. That's a  relationship I really love to hang on to. I like her very much and she has  a glasses fetish. Fortunately or not she doesn't use the internet, so I can  keep you posted about her glasses... </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2006, 10:28</p><p>Ellies story. Part 2 </p><p> </p><p>Arriving back home her flat mate greeted her by saying wow, Ellie you lot hot in those glasses, can I try them on?  Why did everyone want to try on other peoples glasses thought Ellie?  Still, she duly obliged and let Sam try them on;  My god Ellie, you must be blind, I think Ive got a headache already!  was the predictable response. </p><p> </p><p>Right Missy, you are not getting out of it tonight, were going out, said Sam actually, I forgot to tell you that that tall handsome guy, you know, the Brad Pitt lookalike, was asking after you last night. </p><p> </p><p>Ellie smiled for an instance betraying her feelings for the guy that shed secretly been thinking about more often than shed like to admit. Thats it settled, there is no way I am going out if hes going to be there and Im wearing these. Protested Ellie. Sam put a stop to the protestation with a simple, Sorry gal, Ive told him youll be there tonight and youre looking forward to seeing him.  Friends who needs them! </p><p> </p><p>So it was, later that evening Ellie was dressed up and ready to hit the town.  If you take away the glasses I dont look half bad, she thought.  Her plan was to go to the club wearing her glasses and whip them off when she got there. </p><p> </p><p>Waiting outside the club, Ellie was just taking her glasses off when she was tapped on the shoulder.  She turned around and squinted, but she could tell it was her man.  I didnt know you wore glasses Ellie.  Do you mind putting them back on, I thought they looked great on you, but I want to check for sure! </p><p> </p><p>Ellie put her glasses back on, ready to whip them off in an instant.  Wow, you look really, really hot in those was the response, although Ellie could tell by the increasing bulge in  his trousers that he liked what he saw. </p><p>They went into the club and had a fantastic night, at one point they separated to have a few drinks with their respective friends, at which point Ellie was approached by four different guys in the space of 15 minutes, a personal best!  Later that night Ellie and her beau left the club and went back to his flat. </p><p> </p><p>After an amorous hour on the couch, Ellie was led into his bedroom.  He took his shirt of and Ellie could help but gawp at his torso, thank God Ive got the new lenses, I wouldnt want to have missed that sight thought Ellie.  Ellie went to remove her glasses, but was quickly stopped by the request from the bed that she kept them on.   </p><p> </p><p>It was the most memorable sexual experience she had ever known.  She loved the feeling of her glasses slipping down her nose and the experience of being out of control. </p><p>4 weeks later Ellie received a letter from the opticians to return for another contact lens check. She hesitated for a moment before throwing the letter in the bin.   </p><p> </p><p>The last 4 weeks had been the best of her life.  She had never felt so sexy.  Shed also never realised that she had a thing for glasses, wearing them and also seeing her new boyfriend wearing his low minus lenses: yes he too had a hidden requirement for lenses. </p><p>Ellie was a glasses wearer, and she was proud. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glassesforeveryone</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2006, 10:27</p><p>Ellie was a party girl, she was never happier than when she was out on a Friday or Saturday night, dressed up and dancing!   </p><p> </p><p>Ellie prided herself on looking good, taking care with every aspect of her appearance - from her layered hairstyle, designer dress to her strappy sandals.  Ellie would take time getting ready for the nights frolics, much to the annoyance of her flatmate.   This was partly because she struggled to put her contact lenses in; sometimes taking a few attempts to get them in comfortably; it was also partly because Ellie was a single girl enjoying life. </p><p> </p><p>Ellie's confidence had blossomed since leaving school.  At school she had always been pretty enough, but Ellie's looks were overshadowed (in the eyes of the ignorant) by the fact that she wore fairly strong glasses all of the time. </p><p> </p><p>Since leaving school Ellie had got herself contacts, 'the best fashion must-have since the worlds first Gucci handbag' she'd often joke.    The transformation was instant; Ellie noticed that she was getting more than her fair share of admiring glances from members of the other sex.  Buoyed by this, Ellies confidence grew to the point that she was even brave enough to go up to whoever caught her eye in a bar or club and strike up a conversation. </p><p> </p><p>So, it was a shock when Ellies latest contact lens check up revealed an issue with her eyes.  You cannot wear lenses for at least four weeks, maybe longer   Aghast, Ellie was in tears as she left the opticians, she could hardly see a thing; in part because her eyes were streaming and, more significantly, because Ellie had not had new lenses in her glasses for a few years.  The lenses in her current frames were, L: -3.25, -.75 x 175 R: -2.75, -.5 x 10, she knew she needed stronger lenses, but it had never been an issue before </p><p> </p><p>After spending the remainder of the week in bed, Ellie ventured hesitantly out on the Saturday morning.  Yes, a Friday night spent in, despite the efforts of her flatmate to get her out the door.  Squinting when she had to read the passing bus numbers, Ellie thought she could make out a few glances from the opposite sex, although of course, these glances would have been men trying not to laugh at the sorry sight. </p><p> </p><p>Arriving back at the opticians Ellie had her eyes tested and rightly enough the lenses in her current frames were too weak with a new prescription of L: -4.5, -.75 x 175 R: -4.0, -.75 x 10 prescribed.  Fortunately the opticians did a 1 hour service, so Ellie selected a pair of brown cats eye frames and went next door to the coffee shop. </p><p> </p><p>The hour lasted an eternity and Ellie was glad shed had the foresight to bring a large enough book to bury her head in so as not to be seen.  With the time about right Ellie headed back next door to the opticians and picked up her new glasses.  She was happy with the vision through the new lenses, although she hated the increased cut-in and felt sure that she might as well wear a sign around her neck saying ugly, stay well away. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Leanne</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2006, 12:39</p><p>Hi Lurking </p><p>I didn't want the guy to have my glasses because I feel very vulnerable without them. He was OK about it and let me keep them in my bag. I always carry my contacts with me anyway in case of emergencies with my glasses. He's a harmles guy I think, a wealthy business man who likes to tie up with me when he's in London. He usually takes me to fancy restaurants and lets me keep my glasses to read the menu, then I take them off and maybe leave them on the table, he loves to see me squinting at him but it doesn't really help me to see any better. When we leave he likes me to leave my specs off. We've been to a club and a casino and believe me I'm almost blind in dark places so I have to hang onto him. Then we go back to his hotel and the glasses stay off till morning. It is very hard and I do tend to get headaches straining to see things. I just have to remember it's a job and I'm getting paid extra to do this! Hope that answers your questions. </p><p>Leanne xx</p><p></p><hr>

There are lots of people with worse uncorrected eyesight than yours.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Leanne</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2006, 17:40</p><p>Well thanks guys, I can't pretend I know what the numbers mean but I know I cant really see much without my glasses. I'm guessing my short sight is pretty bad as I can't imagine anyone seeing worse than I do but maybe you know different. </p><p>Leanne xx</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2006, 14:47</p><p>Hey Leanne.  Well, if you take your spherical correction, which is your first number, and add it to 1/2 of your astigmatism, you come up with about -10.25D in your right eye, and -10.50D in your left eye. You are right, you are pretty nearsighted. However, there are lots of people with far worse prescriptions than you have. I don't understand why the guy wants you to go around without your glasses.  I would love to be with you if you were wearing your glasses. That would be a real turn on for me, not to have you stumble around half blind, wearing a nice looking pair of glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glowworm</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2006, 11:58</p><p>Leanne, at least I can tell you the following about what those numbers mean: The first number in each row are the diopters of spheric myopia, the second are the diopters of astigmatism, and the third is the axis of the astigmatism. And of course, "L" means left eye and "R" means right eye. ;-) </p><p> </p><p>If you want a more detailed explanation - ask someone who knows it better (and speaks English well enough to explain ;-)).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Leanne</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2006, 11:36</p><p>Hi guys </p><p>I found my prescription if anyone is interested. There are boxes divided into two rows and 5 columns. The rows are L and R and the columms have sph, cyl, axis, base and add written above them. I'm sure you know what all this means but I'm sorry I haven't the faintest. </p><p>Anyway for my left eye the columns read -9.00, -1.75, 90 and the last 2 are blank. For my right, the numbers are -9.75, -1.25, 110, blank, blank. I assume this means something to you guys.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brille</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2006, 03:23</p><p>I have always found glasses well fitted to be sexier. I find glasses slipping down the nose a tired cliché and tacky. No matter how thick or heavy the lenses there is no excuse for an ill fitted pair of glasses. This is just my subjective opinion by the way.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glenn</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2006, 01:41</p><p>My girlfriend has to wear very thick glasses. She is -20 and they are always slidding down her nose. I find it a turn on  anmd she knows it. Often she waits for me to push them back up which I enjoy. I know she cannot see  well when they have slipped down.I actually hold them in place sometimes when we are intimate. Her frames are attractive but I don't think they were made to holld such thick lenses   because the temples do not hook over the ears they just go straight back and the weight of the lenses cause the frame to slip forward.She has another pair of unattractive glasses  she wears whewn she needs to keep them in place but knows I like the loose ones.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glowworm</b>&nbsp;19 Jul 2006, 10:05</p><p>SweetStephine: I know a woman who finds sliding glasses on a man's nose sexy. However, for me - as well as for her afaik - it's not strictly the helplessness thing which makes it attractive (btw: I like frames with thin lenses sliding as well as those with thick lenses), but rather the inconvenience thing. I think it must be quite inconvenient to have the glasses slide down, push them up, having them slide down again, push them up again, and so on. Seems like a Sisyphus thing to me - trying countless times to adjust the glasses properly, but never getting them staying adjusted. How often do you push up your glasses ?</p><p></p><hr>

I know I have it at home somewhere but I've been staying a friends house for the last few days, when I'm not working. My lenses are quite thick, I have to have the thinned down ones which cost a fortune. I can't see anything clearly unless it is almost touching my nose if that helps. Like I said blind as abat! </p><p>When I do the thing with the guy without my glasses it is very hard, I can hardly se anything and he really does have to lead me around. It was pretty frightening at first and I thought about cheating by wearing my contacts. I did go ahead with it though. I found my way to where we met with my glasses on and then wehn he introduced himself he had me take them off. He wanted to keep them but I wouldn't let him and kept them in my bag. H ewas OK about that and didn't argue. I've done it about 3 times since and it has got easier, plus I charge extra!! LOL</p><p></p><hr>

You can order glasses on line from a number of sources without a prescription at sairly low cost, but it helps if yo know what you are doing. </p><p>If you have a recent prescription, we can help you order what you want including Glasses over Contacts (GOC).

<p><b>SweetStephine</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2006, 20:05</p><p> I guess I'll have to respond to such requests. No I don't see well when my glasses slide down, but that doesn't mean I'm completely helpless. Is it possible whats attractive to some gentlemen about glasses sliding is a vulnerabilty thing? Is such confined to one sex only? Could it also be stimulating for a lady to see a boy with hands full and inch thick lenses slipping unexpectedly? I bet they would assume that such alphafemales not only don't exist, but that such a lady would never take advantage of such a situation. For example some long fingernails just happened to pull the poor boys specktagles completely off his face? Or that the whole time he was patting the ground they were hanging from her cleavage as she watched? HMMMM.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2006, 03:31</p><p>I have just taken the survey. Yes, it is bland, the questions miss the point. I think the team created the questionaire with some assumptions, which are not quite appropriate. They seem to believe we love GWGs only because our parents wore glasses when playing with us, driving the family car, or watching TV. BTW, we did not have any car when I was a little boy and my Father bought the first TV set when I was 9.  </p><p>Where are questions about teachers, schoolmates, movie characters, charactes in books that influenced our lives, people at a beach in swimsuits and glasses, etc, etc, "da capo al fine". The results will not show anything significant for a real research.  </p><p>That is my opinion an a 47 years old eyeglasses fetishist, who spent years analyzing and contemplating - and of course sometimes fighting - my fetish, and who came to the stage of reconciliation, peace and harmony with the fellings. If any member of the survey reads this, listen: your survey will tell you nothing. If you want to make a real survey the questionare needs to be quite different.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glowworm</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2006, 11:10</p><p>Dear SweetStephine, </p><p> </p><p>like AA I cannot imagine that you can see well through your glasses when slided down your nose with an RX of -20. When the distance between the eye and the lens increases (and that happens when the glasses slide down the nose), the amount of correction done by the lens decreases. And considering your RX, I guess there must be a lot of correction getting lost when the glasses slide down. </p><p> </p><p>However, I'd like to talk with you about that subject in the chat if you're interested. I'd like to ask you many more questions, perhaps too many to ask them in this thread. Would you like to suggest a day and time to meet in the chat ? Or would you like to "discuss" these things via mail ? If yes, please write to glowworm2004[at]hotmail.com, I'd very appreciate that.

<p><b>Socks</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2006, 00:19</p><p>Sweet Stephanie, </p><p> </p><p>I too am interested in why you like to let your glasses slide down.  I'm not sure why I find it so sexy either.  There might be a couple reasons.  One might be the necessitiy to continually touch them, which is an admission that "I wear glasses and don't mind fussing with them".  I also like when a girl just leaves them low down on her nose and dosen't push them up.  It's kind of like saying "I know I'm wearing glasses, I know they've slid down my nose, but I don't care because I like them there."  It makes people notice the glasses a little more, I think.  Especially if you have to tip your head back or squint to see through them properly, rather than just pushing them up.  There's just something really sexy about seeing more of a girl's nose above the bridge of her glasses than below.  So please elaborate on why you do what you do and why you like it.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2006, 10:59</p><p>For me, its a woman's beautiful eyes "bubbled" or protected behind some mysterious looking prescription lenses. Especially when she blinks or squints.

<p><b>Glowworm</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2006, 05:49</p><p>SweetStephine: I feel similar to Love thick glasses, Socks and Plusheavy. I find it very sexy watching glasses sliding down a woman's nose. For me, it doesn't matter whether they are heavy or light, plus or minus. The sliding is the fascinating thing. If you want to know WHY I find sliding glasses sexy, I cannot explain that in a rational way. It's a fetish thing. Perhaps it has something to do with the non-perfection and inconvenience which it signaled by sliding glasses. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that the glasses wearer is forced to DO something special with her glasses (push them up) instead of just having them sitting on her nose. </p><p> </p><p>So I find it very sexy - and weird - to imagine you pushing back your sliding glasses or not pushing them back while doing dishes and having them fall into the sink. But I hope that they don't get damaged when things like that happen! </p><p> </p><p>Would you like to tell us more about your sliding glasses?

Like most guys in here I like to see a lady wearing nice glasses, but its no different to other attrbutes that other guys see attractive about ladies. Surely any lady worth her salt would rather be complimented about her personality and character and other attributes, such as her friendliess to and consideration for others, sure a compliment about her glasses will be acceptable but thats where it should end, if we really find a lady attractive wearing glasses they should be nothing more than part of her physical appearance..

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;23 May 2006, 04:02</p><p>Bob, </p><p>Julian is right. Myopes have too much plus in their internal lenses for the length of their eyeballs and hyperopes don't have enough plus for the length of theirs.

<p><b>Frances</b>&nbsp;22 May 2006, 23:16</p><p>Bethanne. No my daughter does not have executive style bifocals, but just the normal sort. She tried for over three weeks to wear progressives, but just could not cope, so the optician gave her standard bifocals, which she has coped with very well. As for the youngest daughter ever needing them, only time will tell, my optician has said its quite common for very long sighted people to need a bit of help with close work. I see the same has been stated on this site as well, but we will have to wait and see. Thanks for the interest Bethanne </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Frances</b>&nbsp;21 May 2006, 09:09</p><p>hyperfan, I don@t think my rimless glasses are too thick with my rx, but as I said before, I wear them because I like them, not for other people. I am not the type of lady that worries about what I look like in my glasses, the most important point for me, is that I can see well and read well, thats why I like the executive bifocals, it gives me a large reading area and a large distance area. And as far as I am concerned, that is important. Maybe to some men this is not sexy looking, but as far as I am concerned, thats what i like and thats what I enjoy wearing. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Frances</b>&nbsp;21 May 2006, 04:16</p><p>Hyperfan. Thank you for your nice comments. I do have a seperate pair with the reading scipt in, i find those better for reading in bed with at nights, or if i am reading a book for any length of time. As for my frames, the bifocals are in a rimless frame, quite large, which i like. It may not be every ones taste, but i am wearing them for me, not for anyone else. I also have progressives, but seldom wear them. I was in Hong Kong last year, and ended up buying about 6 different types of glasses, the price was far cheaper than you would pay here. It costs me a fortune at the opticians, i have two teenage daughters who also both have to wear them, afraid they take after their mother, both quite long sighted. Hope this answers your question.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hyperfan</b>&nbsp;21 May 2006, 03:00</p><p>Frances, I agree : very nice RX. An the choice of executive bifocal with a such Rx is very sexy. A question : do you have also glasses with your full prescription (I mean around +8) ? And what kind of frame with your bifocals ?  </p><p>Thanks Frances...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AA</b>&nbsp;20 May 2006, 14:11</p><p>Frances, I,m sure you a real WOW! in your glasses its so nice to see someone with plus glasses in here, I appreciate the common denominator in here is for minus glasses, I think plus glasses beautify the eyes I think Frances your RX is ideal for seeing your beautiful a little enlarged, the clour of the eyes can be seen more clearly, and there is a safty net for plus glasses, if for some reason you lost them or broke them in an emergency apart from reading  you could safely find your way to the optician to have them repaired. you have my vote for plus glasses, and you seem to love your glasses which is really good. Take care Frances AA</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ChrisB</b>&nbsp;02 May 2006, 15:31</p><p>AA, </p><p>I think I would defend any author's right on ES to use the word 'Sexy'. I would not use it myself but for slightly different reasons than the ones you use - Fundamentally we consider people who wear glasses to be more attractive than people who dont (or when they dont). So its reasonable to use the word 'attractive'- hold on tho, the reason we find someone attractive is because consciously or otherwise we want to have sex with them. I have commented elsewhere on the site why glasses should increase 'attractiveness' and there are three reasons - one is malign because it is about fetish and wishing the subject to be in some sense helpless or different. Of the other two the easiest to explain is that genetics and evolution favour symmetry. All sorts of studies in humans and in animals show increased desireability when the subject  image is manipulated to appear symetrical to the viewer. The third is harder to explain - and more contentious. The 19th - mid 20th century view of Eugenics, Evolution and genetics was that 'people' (i.e other people) should breed with and therefore be sexually attracted to increasingly perfect specimens of their own species/race/tribe. But that is of course a gross oversimplification of genetics and evolution and if/when followed to its logical conclusion leads to muscle bound oblivion for a species and as a byproduct, the third reich. What evolution and genetics require is a permanent cycle of miscegenation. (Interbreeding between races). The third and most contentious theory of GWG attractiveness is therefore that we, the optical obsessives, (more than 50% of the population??) see the glasses wearer as a different subspecies that we need to "xxxx the ass off," to improve our genetic mix for the next generation. </p><p> </p><p>Just to conclude - let's return to the use of the word sexy. I fully agree with avoiding the use of this word as it has become totally devalued and debased, certainly in UK culture. (not have an in a national culture in the UK)   The following example illustrates what I mean. I was in the pub a couple of days ago with friends and our respective teenage children. There were two girls in the pub dressed almost identically - very short skirts,fishnet tights (maybe stockings) low, open top that plunged to reveal cleavage. One was 19 the other was 12!! They were both trying to look sexy?? </p><p>ChrisB</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AA</b>&nbsp;29 Apr 2006, 07:14</p><p>I agree glasses can add to a ladies attractiveness, sexy I think would be a rather insulting word to use and I think it demeans repect for our female friends, sexy in glasses seems inappropriate, I far rather like to think glasses enhances a ladies looks, to say glasses are sexy has a conitation in the word of something physical, I,m sure when a lady wears her glasses she does not want to be considered sexy in the physical sense, I have no truck when guys attribute glasses to sex or being sexy, yes I do the look of a lady wearing glasses, i,m sure many ladies far from being sexy looking in glasses have memries when young of awful name calling and verbal abuse because of their glasses, to use the word sexy about their glasses is a form of mild abuse, i would suggest it a form of name calling. </p><p> </p><p>Lets appreciate ladies do look attractive in glasses, after all with modern technolgy, high index lenses and designer frames glasses have become part of the fashion industry, and ladies like to be fashionable.I wonder what your veiws are about calling attractive looking ladies, Sexy because they wear glasses.

My wife and I both wear progressive bifocals and I love it when she wears them while we are having sex.  She like to tease me by wearing sexy clothing, high heel shoes and putting her glasses on as she climbs on top of me in bed.  She also like it when we both wear our glasses while making love. We both find it exciting, so next time let your wife leave her glasses on during your love making.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2006, 07:46</p><p>My wife has been wearing her first pair of glasses/bifocals for only a few days. She says they really help her and she does not mind being a 4 eyes at all. Last night she wanted sex while wearing them but I had her remove them first. Now I think maybe that was the wrong thing to do. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gino</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2006, 06:15</p><p>Had a funny evening yesterday at my friend Lauras 27th birthday party. Shes a glasses wearer as are her mother and sisters. Laura relies on nice wireless frames, shes about 4 in both eyes and occasionally goes around the house without her glasses as she puts them on and off quite often and forgets where she left them. Yet her elder sister Kates vision is worse: shes almost never without her glasses, which are dark brown plastic frames cateyes with a prescription in the 6 area I guess. </p><p> </p><p>At one moment in time yesterday the evening I stepped into the kitchen where both sisters were preparing some appetizers. Laura was without her glasses and squinting real hard to decipher a recipe written down on a piece of paper that lay about 3 ft from her. She asked Kate to borrow her glasses for a moment and her sister spontaneously slipped off her specs and handed them over to Laura while kneading dough. Laura gratefully slipped on and quickly adjusted the glasses, and thanked Kate for now being able to read from the paper. I observed the whole scene while refilling my wine glass and couldnt resist complimenting Laura with her sisters glasses! She laughed but also complained to me that shed soon have to get a stronger prescription as she felt her vision was much better with Kates glasses than her own. </p><p> </p><p>I was only one hour later that night that both sisters came across each other on the dance floor, and found out that they were wearing each others glasses! I guess Kate badly needed some vision support when leaving the kitchen and forcedly resorted to Lauras weaker glasses. The swapped glasses again, leaving me with a huge boner on the dance floor! </p><p> </p><p>Have you ever witnessed similar glasses exchanges and/or borrowings?</p><p></p><hr>

It will make the experience a whole lot better for the both of you.   </p><p> </p><p>It will spice up your life as she can now leave you guessing which pair she will wear.  And it can be a turn on for her as well, because family, friends or work collegues will "check her out" each time they see her to see which frames she has on, and I bet that being "noticed" on a regular basis will be a big boost to her self esteem. </p><p> </p><p>My wife currently has 14 pairs of glasses, and it is a REAL turn on for me to see which pair she will wear for the day.  (See my post on 29th Nov 2005) On some occasions she will even change from 1 pair to another during the day (without telling me) just to see my reaction. </p><p> </p><p>So NEW TO ES, keep up the good work of enjoying your wife and her glasses, but more importantly, keep up the good work of improving her self esteem.</p><p></p><hr>

I wonder if like me Hyperofan you find ladies who wear strong glasses seem to have lovely personalities, and are very loyal and genuine and are one guy women, if you know any other ladies who wear high plus glasses heres a guy who would be delighted to correspond with her.

I told her that she may change but, even if she used to wear strong plus for a time, she seems to be afraid of needing progressives or stronger lenses.  </p><p>About me I would like to see her, wearing + 8 or more, wit and add.

I know my attraction for ladies wearing glasses dated back to my school days when our art teacher who was a bit punky wore the most outrageous plus glasses, she was a real gem of a person with the most wonderful personality, I always associate plus glasses with attractive personalities.</p><p></p><hr>

That way she can put on a different pair every morning - its keeps you guessing which pair she will wear - just to spice up life a little bit more.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NEW TO  ES</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2005, 16:07</p><p>My wife bought a new pair of glasses today. They are Versace frames, brown in color, retangular in shape with rhinestones on the frames where the frame connects to the ear piece.

I remember her giving me a ride with her car to work one time and she didnt use contacts or glasses. Watching her driving (pretty fast aswell) and squinting and still hardly seeing anything was quite a turn on... Its not everyday an almost blind person drives me around.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Seeker</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2005, 20:36</p><p>With the greater knowledge from following Eyescene, I sometimes recall wonderful opportunities missed from ignorance. A former girlfrined who was quite seriously short sighted went through the stage of getting the thick slightly tinted plastic frameless lenses when they were briefly the fashion. Hers had about 1.5cm thickness. We were talking one night and I asked if they were heavy. She passed them to me and they were not as heavy as they looked. I kept them for a while and put them on the table between us. Only recently have I realised that this was quite a trusting gesture on her part and pretty thoughtless on mine not to hand them back to her.</p><p></p><hr>

When i walked into the seating area i saw her sitting in the last row. When i sat down next to her i mentioned that she always liked to sit closer to the screen, and she replied that it was no longer a problem as to where we sat. She then openned her purse and removed a beautiful pair of black framed versace glasses and placed them on her face. She then told me that she finally went for an eye exam and never realized how much better her vision was with glasses. I told her she looked beautiful and very sexy with her glasses. After the movie ended she left them on and kept them on for the remainder of the night. I loved it that my girlfriend wore glasses instead of squinting to see.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;11 Dec 2005, 11:51</p><p>Hype - More plus than she needs will effectively make your gf short or near sighted.

I enjoy having my lenses rubbed against me.  I too will let him cum on my lenses every so often.  I didn't realize that guys got turned on by gals in glasses.  The one thing that I have to worry about is not rolling on top of them, so that we don't break or bend the frames.  This is a lot better than the last guy I dated who hated me wearing glasses.  He would always insist on me not wearing them.  After a while, it got old, so I ended up dumping him.  </p><p></p><hr>

We really enjoy making love while both of us are wearing our glasses and find that we are leaving them on more often while doing it. </p><p>The other night my wife came out of the bathroom wearing sexy attire, with high heel shoes.

Especially if the lenses are cold and as they are smooth, touching the breasts with them, gives the woman a great feeling, even better than touching them with ice cubes...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michelle</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2005, 06:14</p><p>Hello.  I was browsing the net when I happened to come across your site.  It is very interesting since I've only just learnt there was a glasses fetish. </p><p> </p><p>I have worn glasses for 15 years, getting them as a young bride. (When I was finally able to see what I married, I got rid of him).   </p><p> </p><p>I thought wearing glasses was a hassle and would often wear contacts.  I felt that no man would find a girl in glasses attractive. </p><p> </p><p>I have recently met a wonderful man who has introduced me to the 'other side' of the glasses scene and, I tell you, I'm really enjoying it. </p><p> </p><p>I had no idea that I could feel so sexy in them.  I know a lot of women see them more of a hindrance but seeing the reaction of my man when I peer over the top of them gives me the confidence to continue wearing them. </p><p> </p><p>Its a huge turn on that he finds me so sexy with my hair pulled back and the glasses perched on the bridge of my nose.   </p><p> </p><p>We usually make love while I'm wearing them.  I sit on top of him and look down at him with my frames sliding down my nose.  I sometimes let him cum on them while I'm wearing them. </p><p> </p><p>We go shopping for new frames a couple of times a year.  He is an expert at knowing what looks good on me and what suits me.

<p><b>Specslover</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2005, 05:32</p><p>Hi - I'm brand new to this site, and I thought I would tell you about my wife. </p><p> </p><p>My wife had worn glasses for years before we met, but didn't know that there was a glasses fetish.  I told her very early on in our relationship about my glasses "thing" and she wanted to know more.  So I have been educating her about the fetish and culture. </p><p> </p><p>She has accepted it totally without the slightest problem and actually goes out of her way to accomodate me. Ive bought her 14 new pairs which she can choose from on a daily basis.   </p><p> </p><p>She nearly always wears her glasses during sex.  We practise many sexy things during our love making.  </p><p> </p><p>Some of the things we do are :- I choose which pair she wears.  She wears them down her nose - just a little (not too stereotyped).  I "adjust" them as I see fit.  I touch them while she is wearing them - both frame and lens.  She often takes them off and puts them on me, and touches the frame and lens in an erotic way.  I quite often run my tongue along the frames and lick the lens while she is wearing them - sometimes she does it to me while I'm wearing her glasses.  On occasions she will get another pair, and we have a pair each - touching and licking.  On some occasions she will put both pairs on, one over the other. </p><p> </p><p>She always peers over the top of them while giving me head and it drives me absolutely crazy.  There have been a few occasions where I have cum on them as well - although I must admit that I still have a few "problems" doing this - its a respect thing I guess - I'm a bit old fashioned. </p><p> </p><p>I'm off now, my wife is going to bed - with that glint in her eye - and a very sexy pair of black plastic frame glasses on. </p><p> </p><p>Now that I've found you, I would like to come back regularly.  Maybe I can even convince my wife to write a post...  Good night, sweet dreams... </p><p> </p><p>Re*specs*fully, </p><p>Specslover</p><p></p><hr>

The first time we went to bed together I didnt think of slipping off my glasses, and as he didnt ask me to take them off either, I just kept them on. Which I actually liked as I could at least see the action! Only after a few weeks did he tell me how much he liked me in glasses, which I really think was kind of his as I needed such compliment being conscious of the potential drawback of glasses! Since that day our relationship has been ever better! We even went to the optician together and he bought me what we call our fun glasses (cheap red plastic frames fitted with strong enough lenses though cheap, and thus thick!). Our greatest turn-on is his spraying my glasses while I am still looking through them. I enjoy to keep on the cummed-on glasses afterwards when going to the bathroom, kitchen, Well girls, any more stories from your side on the topic of spex and sex?  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dom</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2005, 07:56</p><p>When my girlfriend and I first got together she asked me if she could wear her glasses during sex so that she could see me. I thought she was joking and didn't realise her eyes could be so bad. I've since found out what short sight really means and that people with her sort of prescription actually can't see much at all without correction. Since then she has usually worn her glasses for part or all our love making. I find it a real turn on but I also like the unfocussed, squinting look she has without her glasses. Can't really decide which I prefer</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2005, 06:16</p><p>I understand the feeling CityRK. An ex-girlfriend of mine didn't have a glasses fetish, but since we started to go out together, she started to wear her glasses during sex. At first she had only one pair of glasses, which kept sliding down her nose during sex and I would fix them. Sometimes she would make me wear them cause she liked making me feel dizzy. </p><p>Later on she purchased a new smaller pair of glasses. So either she would wear her new pair and make me wear her old pair, or she would wear both her frames, her new ones from underneath and her old plastic larger frames on top! Needless to say that although this was a big turn on for me, we weren't able to make many sudden moves during sex cause her glasses would be totally misplaced. Nevertheless it was very erotic. </p><p>But the biggest turn on was the following one. Some nights that we would go out at a club or bar, she wore her contacts. Afterwards we would go to her place a bit dizzy from the drinks. There she voluntarily wore her glasses on top of the contacts and put her other pair on me. So both of us were dizzy from the  alcohol and dizzy from the eyesight and we would have the best sex ever. Needless to say that after that the glasses were all smeared and fogged up. Then she would take off her contacts and  go on a second round wearing just her glasses. Sometimes she would wear her both pairs on top of the contacts. </p><p>Even when we went at a hotel, or at my place, she would bring both her pairs of glasses with her, even if she was wearing her contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>CityRK</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2005, 16:27</p><p>I never really thought about making love with the glasses on until my wife and I both started wearing glasses.  I got glasses about two years ago, and my wife started wearing them this past summer (my wife and two daughters got them at the same timesee Vision post).  It all started as a spontaneous episode one night last summer, and it has been a common thing for us.  However, there are times that we pull each others glasses off and place our glasses on top of each other.  Somehow, we agree that the sight of our glasses laying on top of each others has a certain sexual appeal to it, as well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Desert Trail</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2005, 16:12</p><p>Ever since I recently started wearing glasses, my wife urged me to wear them during sex.  When the woman is turned on, it makes it so much better.  She just goes wild when my glasses start to fog up.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2005, 01:20</p><p>Ack - I had a girlfriend long ago who wore the large framed glasses fashionable at the time.

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2005, 19:22</p><p>Although results are usually not that dramatic (we could only wish), there seems to be a 40/10/40 split between Love/Neutral/Hate glasses. Of the people that love them, probably less than 10% would actually admit it (most keep it a secret.)  And probably less than 1% would be bold enough to seek out a forum like this one. Although I focused on Girls With Glasses on my site ( <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180717081313/http://www.geocities.com/likeglass55/" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/likeglass55/</a> ), I suspect the female view probably shares a lot of common ground.</p><p></p><hr>

She's only had them for a short time, but confidently wears them like it's been years.  She wore them in that incredible sex session.  Her glasses are definately a tool that enhances the sex for her, too.  Yes, I did wear my glasses and will for every sex episode from this point on.

Anyway, I think you will find a lot of people in here that can totally understand her passion and her obsession about seeing you in glasses. When my girlfriend bought her new glasses we had the best sex ever. And the funny thing is that since then, she wanted to keep her glasses on during sex, without ever having to ask her to. Did you have your glasses on during sex all the time or did you take them off at some point? </p><p>If you ever start having sex without you wearing the glasses, try putting them on during sex and, trust me, she will really be turned on. ;-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fireball</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2005, 10:46</p><p>My girlfriend has a severe case of this glasses fettish.  I needed new glasses after over 2 years of not updating my script. For weeks shes been asking why I never wear my glasses.  I'm a full time contact lens wearer and found no need to keep my glasses script current.  With outdated glasses I was able to stop her constant pleads to wear my glasses and give my eyes a break from contacts. We went to one of those 1 hour places to pick out new frames.  She went wild making me try on every frame she loved.  Before I knew it she had most of the store workers giving me their opinion.  I have to admit I enjoyed all the female attention (but over glasses? That blew me away).  After a long drawn out process, I ordered my new glasses.  My girlfriend could hardly contain herself. She was disappointed that my contacts were still in and couldn't take them out until I got home.  The glasses stayed in the case all the way home.  What happened after that is incredible.  Some the best sex anyone could imagine.  Wow, what was I missing out on.  Who would have ever imagined...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Desert Trail</b>&nbsp;10 Oct 2005, 20:20</p><p>I must admit that I was intrigued when I found out about this website.  The eyewear fetish thing is rather new to me, although I have been finding out a lot since Ive been reading through this website over the past couple of months (including the archives).  This past summer, I discovered that my wife has an eyewear fetish ever since I realized that I would be needed glasses for a 2 prescription.  Several years ago before I met my wife, I checked out at -.25, which was called uncomfortable 20/20 vision, and wearing glasses wasnt a requirement.  I tried hard to take care of my eyes, and do exercises to improve my vision.  Over the years, though, it didnt seem to help much, as the daily strain took its toll.  This past summer, my wife noticed how I was struggling with my night driving vision, and advised me to get an eye exam.  At worst, I thought I would only need glasses for driving.  Nevertheless, my wife seemed to be surprisingly interested in helping me find some nice frames after I learned I was at a 2 prescription.  A day later, I got a call on my cell phone from the optician lady who helped me out.  I still wasnt convinced that I would need the glasses on a full time basis, but I recall her saying that I got some nice frames, especially since I would probably be wearing them most of the time.  She then told me that once I start wearing them, I would see the difference.  She noticed that I was a little apprehensive about my first pair of glasses.  After she put the glasses on me, she later smiled, and pulled me aside, and whispered, by the way, your wife is REALLY excited about your new look, and when she sees how great you look, I think its going to knock her socks off!  I later showed up at home with my glasses on (with the encouragement of the optician), and my wife was just walking in through the doorwall from the lanai/pool area.  When she noticed me in the glasses, I saw the look of excitement on her face.  Out of excitement, her right leg quickly flung back and her flip-flop flew off through the door wall area and into the pool.  She then jumped out of her other flip-flop and skipped over to me, and exclaimed that she always looked forward to seeing me in glasses one day, as shes always been attracted to, and turned on by the look of men in sexy eyewear.  She then said with a laugh that I looked so good that it blew the shoes off her feet.  Since that time, our romance has sparked to a new level.  Overall, I may have struggled for years with weakening eyesight in vain.  However, the thrills of the current moments have been fantastic.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2005, 05:59</p><p>Don't know if I can try to explain Natalie's prescription well enough so you can comprehend what the numbers mean Dom, but here goes. In her right eye she needs a sperical correction of -12.50D, however on the plane that is slightly off horizontal(0 to 180 is horizontal, always working from right to left) she requires a further -1.75D at the 10 axis(or 190, which is not used), making her required prescription -14.25 on this plane. Then she requires 3 degrees of base out prism as well, to bring the focus of her right eye to the proper place.  Then in her left eye she needs -13.25D, with another -2.50D on the 180 axis(exactly horixontal). Again she requires a base out prism to bring her eyes to focus. together. The prism could be because one eye is off 6 degrees, and they have just split the prism up to give her a little prism in each eye, rather than 6 degrees in only one eye - which really would add to the outer edge lens thickness of just one eye. If this were the case though you would notice that one of her eyes looked towards the wall when she was wearing contact lenses. </p><p>These lenses would be fairly expensive to make, and since just no rookie could do them, no wonder they will take 2 weeks. </p><p>I am sure that Natalie has the little bit of prism eqaully in both eyes.  But, even with such a small amount of prism, it would create a lot of strain for her to see without her glasses. In other words, when wearing contact lenses, she would be straining her eyes a lot to try to bring everything into focus, and would be seeing double - more so when her eyes are tired. </p><p>Just a small suggestion, but if she wants to wear her contacts - or if you want her to wear her contacts, to avoid wearing her full strength glasses, get her a pair of transition lensed glasses, with only the prism correction in them. She can wear the prism over her contacts. Personally I would never tell her about this suggestion, and would treasure the fact that she has to wear glasses. And surgery is really not much of an option. They really can't remove the requirement for prism. Hope this helps you a little</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dom</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2005, 00:25</p><p>Well Natalie dragged me around five different optical shops and tried on about 500 different pairs of frames. She was wearing her contacts so she could see herself but kept asking my opinion. I thought she looked great in at least half of the frames but she couldn't decide. Anyway everywhere she went they commented on how strong her prescription was and said that she would need the thinner lens type. They kept telling her that she couldn't have this frame or that frame because her lenses would be too thick and so it went on. Eventually we ended back at the first place and to my eternal relief she settled on a pair of smallish plastic frames. They were brownish tortoishell coloured and she did look fantastic in them. The woman in the shop then took all her details and measured the distance between her eyes. They said the lenses would take about 2 weeks to arrive and so she is still waiting for them. I was amazed at how much they cost too, about £400 just so she can see properly. I get to see properly for free, it doesn't seem fair. I probably sound like it was a bit of an ordeal but it was quite fun really and I was flattered that she valued my opinion.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2005, 08:12</p><p>So Dom - where are you and whats been happening with Natalie's new glasses ??</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2005, 22:12</p><p>Dom,you're one lucky son of a bitch....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dom</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2005, 22:06</p><p>Thanks Guido, it's astonishing that Nat can only see clearly up to 2.5 inches away but it does tie in with what I have observed. The other morning while in bed she wanted to know the time so she picked up her watch from the nightstand and held it almost touching her nose. She didn't even bother trying to see the large digits on the alarm clock about a foot or so away. </p><p>By the way, what do the prism and base parts of the prescription mean? </p><p>Finally another thing to make you guys a little envious I think, Natalie has asked me to go and help her choose new glasses on Saturday. Any volunteers?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guido</b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2005, 10:34</p><p>The numbers area convention for measuring lens strength equal to the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.  If you do the inversion, it will tell you how far the person can see clearly unaided or the far point.  Using a rough average of her script of -14, she would be able to see an object clearly up to about 2.5 inches.  This does not condider vertex distance, or the distance of the lens from the eye, or the astigmatism correction or cylinder which accounts for irregular focus.  The minus sign is a convention that designates a lens having its focal point in front of the lens, concave)( versus a  plus lens having its focal point behind the lens, convex().  </p><p> </p><p>I am sure there must be a great site on the web that explains this more clearly. </p><p> </p><p>Math 14 DIOPTERS= 1/ FOCAL LENGTH M. </p><p> </p><p>FOCAL LENGTH = 1 / 14 M. </p><p> </p><p>FOCAL LENGTH = About .071 Meters or  </p><p> </p><p>71 millimeters.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dom</b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2005, 09:39</p><p>I realise I'm very lucky but perhaps not in the way you guys are referring to. Having said that I do find it very arousing when Nat removes her glasses. There's something I can't quite define about her eyes that shows she can't see much without them. It's a huge turn on to be honest, which surprised me as I've never had these sort of feelings before. It's an even more intense feeling now that I realise just how poor her eyesight is. </p><p>Would someone like to have a stab at explaining to me what the numbers on her prescription mean.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Slit</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2005, 22:39</p><p>Thats right S4E, finding a girl with such high rx is a dream of mine... </p><p> </p><p>Dom, you are so lucky, in  my opinion.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2005, 19:28</p><p>No wonder she would rather wear glasses. With the 3 base prism her eyes would not be focusing together properly wearing her contacts.  I take it that you are not a glasses affectionado Dom, but to one of us, you have found a treasure.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bart</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2005, 09:30</p><p>About -16 along the vertical meridian, sorry. And it's really a lot. I must say that it's quite impossible for her even to distiguish close shapes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bart</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2005, 09:08</p><p>Her left eye is surely the worst, there is quite a lot of astigmatism due to the -2.50 added to the -13.25 sphere. That means that she has an rx of about -15 along the vertical meridian of her left eye.  </p><p>The base prism means that she has some strabismus too.. Dom, if you have seen the online simulation with -10 well, we can say her acuity is much worse than that. </p><p>Have she troubles seeing from distance with her present glasses?   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dom</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2005, 08:43</p><p>Nat's eye exam was on Friday and I did get to see her prescription. She was quite happy to talk about it and seemed pleased that I was taking an interest. She said her yes had got slightly worse and that she needs to get new glasses. </p><p>I wrote down the numbers while she was out of the room cos I'd never remember them otherwise. OK so there are column headings across the top as follows sph cyl axis prism base and there are two rows one for distance and one for near. The near row is completely blank. </p><p>The numbers for her right eye are respectively -12.50 -1.75 10  3 out and for her left eye -13.25 -2.50 180 3 out. I assume this all means something to you guys. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>uest</b>&nbsp;10 Jul 2005, 11:19</p><p>Dom, has she had her exam?  I think you said it was scheduled for last Friday.  Did you get to see her prescription?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Slit</b>&nbsp;10 Jul 2005, 11:10</p><p>Hi Dom, </p><p> </p><p>I guess that with such poor vision, your girlfriend will find very difficult to put on the contact lenses be cause she cant see any thing further than her nose. </p><p> </p><p>How is she picking up the lenses when she is not wearing glasses? </p><p> </p><p>But I must tell that you are extremely lucky to have such a cool gorl with such a strong rx.

<p><b>Dom</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2005, 08:43</p><p>Apologies for sounding like a broken record. I just wondered if any of you guys had felt the same as me at any time. Anyway, I'll leave it there</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Luke</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2005, 05:21</p><p>Dom - or "don't get over it", particularly if it's a turn on.  It's hard to imagine, yes, but you'd get used to it. </p><p> </p><p>Interesting that Natalie feels more professional with contacts.  At least in the U.S, most people associate glasses with intelligence and being "professional"...at least on *other* people (rather than themselves).  Unfortunately, a lot of people, probably girls in particular, come to associate contacts with looking presentable and glasses with being laid-back, less dressed-up.  "Slobby", one of my friends put it once, which was ironic, because her glasses looked awesome on her and certainly anything but slobby. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mickey</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2005, 18:47</p><p>Dom -get over it and feel extremely lucky.I'm sure many of us here would love to be in your position. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dom</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2005, 12:40</p><p>Thanks again guys for your advice. Natalie does have contacts, in fact she was wearing them when we first met. She told me she wore glasses on our first date. On our second date she asked me if I minded if she wore glasses the next time we saw each other. I didn't mind either way so I said yes. When I first saw her in them she looked very different, I almost didn't recognise her and I did think the lenses seemed quite strong. However she looked fantastic and the glasses really suited her. She finds contacts uncomfortable and so prefers her glasses most of the times we are together. She wears her contacts at work quite a lot though, she says she feels more confident and professional without glasses. Actually she is away on business at the moment and I am really missing her. I won't see her again till Friday evening after her eye check up. </p><p>To be honest I still can't get over how poor her vision is. I keep imagining her waking up in the morning, being confronted this horrendous blur and not being able to see a thing until she puts her specs on and then having to keep them on all day till she goes to bed. It's so difficult for me to imagine what it must be like.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Luke</b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2005, 05:10</p><p>Dom -- I think, as others have said, that Natalie's *vision* probably isn't as big a deal to her as a part of you feels like it is.  It's natural for you to dramatize it in your head, though, because it's hard to imagine seeing things with so much blur.  But...she may have stronger feelings about her *glasses*, either because of teasing she might have experienced in school, or because of times she wasn't able to find her glasses, something like that.  This could be interesting to talk about with her, if you're comfortable bringing it up. </p><p> </p><p>I'm curious if she ever tried contact lenses?  Not sure where you live, but most girls (where I've been) seem to feel a lot of pressure to wear contact lenses if their prescription is on the stronger side.  It's wonderful if Natalie doesn't, though perhaps she found contacts uncomfortable.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AA</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2005, 16:17</p><p>Dom, there is no need to worry about your girl friends eye sight, if she is over 21 her Rx will soon stabilise, if you want to know how well she sees without glasses try them on and what you can see with them is what she sees without glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Dom I think your making it a big issue in your mind, she has worn glasses I guess since she about 2 or 3, they are part of her life just like breathing and to her its no big deal, I would dare to suggest in her own home she could take her glases off and still manage to make a cup of tea and find her way round the just as well as anyone with normal vision. Dom I,m so pleased you appreciate her beautiful eyes, so lovely when she takes her glasses off. </p><p> </p><p>Lastly if your worried about any future increases in her Rx tell her to ask the optician if and when her Rx will settle. </p><p> </p><p>I know a women who has an RX of - 11 and been the same for over 27 years, now she needs reading glasses for small print, or if she has forgotten her reading glasses, she puts her distance glasses down her nose to read. </p><p> </p><p>Dom there is no need to concern yourself about your girl friend RX she as she has told she,s fine. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2005, 14:20</p><p>Dom, what's important is how well you see with glasses.  My glasses are similar to Natalie's, and I can't see anything but shapes without my glasses, but with them on, I have 20/20 vision.  That's what really matters.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dom</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2005, 14:11</p><p>Thanks for your replies guys. The consensus seems to be that Natalie's eyesight is very very poor. I must admit that I'm quite shocked by this, I really thought that maybe she saw things a little blurred and it was more comfortable for her to wear glasses all the time and maybe essential for watching TV, driving etc. From that simulator it appears that she would be almost blind without her glasses and would have trouble walking around without bumping into things. This is having a strange emotional impact on me. On the one hand I feel quite sorry for her having to go through life with such awful vision and I want to protect her and keep her safe. It's a weird feeling. One the other hand I'm in awe of her at how she takes her short sight in her stride and just gets on with it. Maybe I'm over dramatising this, I don't know. </p><p>Anyway, she has an eye test booked for Friday so this should give me more opportunity to talk about her eyes and maybe I'll get to see her prescription. Another thing, as we lay in bed the other morning, Natalie without her glasses, she asked me what time it was even though the digital clock was on her side of the bed very close to her and the digits on it are huge, like 1 and a half inches high. So I think your estimates of what her vision is like are probably pretty accurate. Finally AA I've seen Natalie without her glasses many times and she does indeed have very large and very gorgeous eyes, in fact I've commented on them on a number of occasions. I've also told her that her glasses look great and really suit her and I'm being perfectly truthful when I say it too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AA</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2005, 06:11</p><p>Dom, I think your a lucky guy to have meet someone so nice and with lovely thick glasses,I don,t think you should ask you girl friend to take her glasses off, once you see those beautiful eyes behind the glasses you will not want her glasses back on. People with a very high - RX have the most gorgeous eyes imaginable, they almost seem as pure as crystal and sprakle like diamonds they are so beautiful you will constantly want to see the eyes and not the glasses. Dom also at least you know how beautiful her eyes are, and other guys who would not give her a second look because of her glasses don,t know what they are missing, its so true never judge a book by its cover. </p><p> </p><p>I appreciate Dom part of the physical attraction of your girlfriend was her glasses, I,m a non glasses wearer, I,m opposite to you I love high plus RX,s, athough high plus glasses wearers eyes arenot as beautiful as high minus wearers. </p><p> </p><p>Well Dom you seem to have a lovely girl friend I hope this secures your future happiness, most off all take care of her. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2005, 17:13</p><p>Dom, with a -12 prescription she can see almost nothing, unless it is right in front of her nose. Does she always wear glasses or is wearing contacts too occasionally? If she always wears glasses, I think she would feel really good if she hears you say how beautiful she looks with them on. </p><p>Now if you want to get her to take off her glasses and tell you what she can see, wait for a moment when you will be sitting on the sofa and are hugging, kissing etc and ask her if you could remove her glasses. That way she won't feel bad, because it will be important for her that she will feel your presence. An old girlfriend of mine used to tell me that whenever I was holding her and I was taking off her glasses, she was feeling really nice, cause, besides the blur, she knew I was there and that was reassuring for her. She felt like I was there to protect her.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bart</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2005, 13:23</p><p>Hi Dom, your is surely a very cool situation, though I'm really sorry for your girlfriend eyesight that's very poor indeed. With -12 she can see only the shapes of quite close objects, distant things are almost impossible to see and even near ones are really blurry. For this reason it's quite hard to focus on a pair of glasses on a table, because for their limited dimensions there is not enough acuity to distinguish them. Even recognizing your own face shoud be quite hard for her except by putting her nose on your chicks ;) </p><p>Think that a friend of mine has some troubles to find his glasses being only -6 or so.... myopia in fact is considered high when it gets over the 6 diopters, that's the level by wich you cannot see anymore the biggest letter on a doctor eyechart.  </p><p>In the end, you could easily imagine what she can do without her glasses...         </p><p>Anyway, say you like her with her glasses, she will surely appreciate much... :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dom</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2005, 00:33</p><p>Hi. I had a good look at Natalie's glasses last night. The lenses are quite thick, probably I would say about 10mm at the outside edge although the frames are quite thick too and cover a lot of this. The lenses from the front do take quite a chunk out of her face too as you described Luke. I also had a bit of a conversation with her about her glasses. She said ahe has been wearing them since she was 5 years old (she's 26 now) and that her eyes have got steadily worse since then and she can't see anything on the opticians eye chart without glasses. I asked her what her prescription was and she said she wasn't sure but remembers it being about -12 a few years ago but she is due for another check up. I wanted to get her to take off her glasses and tell me what she could see but couldn't pluck up the courage in case she thought I was a little weird. This -12 doesn't really mean anything  to me to be honest (other than it is obviously stronger than -11) in terms of how a person sees without glasses. Could any of you explain to me how things might appear to Natalie without her glasses on. What would she be able to do? could she recognise me? that kind of thing. I know for instance that she has never learned to swim and has quite a fear of water and I'm guessing this might be because of her eyesight. Thanks again for your replies.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dom</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2005, 12:45</p><p>Thanks for your quick responses Luke and Tortoise. Ive largely been oblivious to glasses until recently and hence have little idea of how people see without them. To try and answer your questions. My gf is definitely nearsighted; she can only see things very close to. Her glasses make her eyes appear noticeably smaller than they actually are and she wears plastic oval shaped frames which I would say are smallish. Beyond that I dont really know Im ashamed to say. As for the thickness of her lenses, Ive never really noticed and nor do I have the faintest idea what her prescription is. My gut feeling would be that her glasses are strong due to the amount they reduce the size of her eyes. She is coming to my house in about 10 mins so I will try and make some more detailed observations and maybe ask her things about her eyesight and so on. Ill keep you posted. By the way she is called Natalie and is absolutely gorgeous, with or without her glasses. One thing which surprised me was the erotic feelings I had towards her just from watching her grope for her glasses. Ive never experienced this type of thing before and find it a little disconcerting. Thanks again for replying to my post.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Luke</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2005, 07:52</p><p>Dom -- Are her lenses thick at all?  How thick?  And how big/small are the frames/lenses?  And if you look at her from the front, does the edge of her face seem to be "cut in" a little bit?  Is it a noticable amount, or hardly at all?   If she ever looks at something with her glasses off, how close to her eyes does she bring it?  These things will give clues to how bad her vision is.  Also, do her glasses "look strong" to you (just as far as your gut feeling)? </p><p> </p><p>Generally, people who are nearsighted - and I'm guessing your girlfriend is - can have vision anywhere from only very slightly off from normal to almost complete blindness.  It's actually possible to be so nearsighted that even something very large is just a blob...imagine having to get within 1 foot of a stop sign in order to read it.  But this is rare.  In your girlfriend's case, she's probably "moderately" myopic, with a prescription between -5 and -9.  Weaker than this, and she probably wouldn't have groped for her glasses.  Stronger than this and you'd probably have pointed out that her glasses are really thick.  If this is right, then she can see a lot without her glasses, but nothing detailed without it being pretty close to her face.   And, in most cases, it is no problem at all for someone who's nearsighted to function normally with their glasses on.  (Yeah, losing one's glasses is a potential problem, but not usual.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2005, 07:22</p><p>Hi Dom, is your girlfriend nearsighted or hyperopic, I wonder?  Do her glasses make her eyes appear smaller or larger?  You might want to discuss her vision with her in a supportive way and ask what her prescription is.  Her vision may be that poor without correction of course, even though she functions well with her glasses.  It seems to me that her glasses would be noticeably strong, though.  On the other hand some people feel "blind" without their glasses even though their vision is not terribly bad.  It's sort of a psychological dependency I think. </p><p>Cheers</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dom</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2005, 05:30</p><p>Hi I'm new here. I would appreciate some advice regarding the following. My girlfriend of three months wears glasses and always claims to be "as blind as a bat" without them. I have always assumed she's exaggerating and to be honest haven't really given glasses much thought until recently. However the other night we were sitting on her sofa and started kissing and stuff (as you do). I took off her glasses, which she's always quite happy for me to do and set them down on the nearby coffee table. After the intimate stuff was over I went into the kitchen and as I returned I saw my gf reaching to pick up her glasses. However she quite obviously couldn't see them because she groped around on the table for a few seconds nowhere near where I had placed them before her hand eventually knocked into them and she was able to put them on. I was quite astonished that someone's sight could be so poor as the glasses were quite obvious to me from much further away. I also have to admit that I watched her for a few seconds and found the whole incident rather a turn on. Whenever we sleep together she always puts her glasses on before getting out of bed even just to pop to the bathroom but as I say I never really gave it much thought. </p><p>So really my question is how bad can her vision be, what would she see without her glasses. Is she really that blind? To be honest it has really shocked me and I wonder how someone with vision that bad could function properly even though it is correctable. Thanks in advance for your answers/comments.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>minic</b>&nbsp;23 May 2005, 19:07</p><p>AA, I've experienced that situation and unfortunately it did in fact ruined my relationship. Perhaps for me it is not only added attribute, but maybe one of the main ingredients. Sorry, maybe you can find it weird, but I really always see girls with glasses very attractive and sexy, I always wanted girl with glasses and to me it is like getting skiny sporty looking girl who would baloon into 250 pounds and sorry attraction is not there any more. Maybe it is hard to understand, after some time everyday life and relationship will change and it is up to each other to find out what that other person finds attractive to get it going rather than looking somewhere else. Believe me, I"ll go miles and bend backwards for girl with nice sexy frames and nice lenses, but of course we are all different...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>PN</b>&nbsp;21 May 2005, 07:03</p><p>My girlfriend had Lasik a couple of years ago. She was the sexiest ever with her -4'ishs. She still is the sexiest girl for me, even though I miss her looks with the glasses. But her personality is still the same. I have never told her about my obsession, and I never will. She develloped an obsession for sunglasses instead. Cheap, cute, funny looking etc. She said now she can buy as much as she like instead of only 1 pair percription sunglasses at sky high prices. So I guess I have to stick with that instead. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AA</b>&nbsp;21 May 2005, 06:02</p><p>mimic, I appreciate we all choose a lady for various attributes and like you I do date ladies who wear glasses, I do not find glasses sexy rather an added attribute which I find gives a lady a type of look I find attractive, I think if we find glasses sexy what happens if the lady you maybe dating suddenly decides to have lasik and stops wearing glasses, do you still find her sexy or does your sexiness diminish, you see its not logical to say glasses are sexy, then again as you say its how we perceive sexiness, and me your right to challenge me of what is considered sexy, and good for you to hold onto your opinion.

<p><b>minic</b>&nbsp;20 May 2005, 20:39</p><p>AA, let me ask you, since you can't understand why some people here / me included / can find 2 pieces of glass and plastic sexy. Why other people can find silicon inserted into other body sexy, some guys like braces sexy, leather clothing, big breasts, legs, big butts, some guys like skiny, some fat girls ..We are all different and we all get turned on by different things, my very good friend got divorced 10 years ago and since that he only dates black woman / he is white /, but he finds that sexy and it was always his secret dream. And I do understand what you mean about personality and looking for real person behind glasses which is certainly important for future relationship, but if I like girls with glasses I would definitively try to choose girl wearing glasses, because it is something, what turnes me on and I found sexy and I don't see how I could possibly degrade that person.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AA</b>&nbsp;20 May 2005, 17:07</p><p>Hi Mile Bottles I find it sad you can use language such as you do to describe your glasses, surely this instills in your thoughts an image which maybe totally false to those who meet you. I think its simple glasses aid you to see better and thats the end of it. Anyone judging you as a person on your glasses is ignorant and emotionally dead. I don,t wear glasses myself, with nice designer frames and high index lenses glasses can look good on the wearer, I must say I have tried to understand why so many posts say glasses are sexy, how can something made out of glass and plastic be sexy, surely looking sexy or attractive is the individual, the personality, and their charcter, I think making reference to glasses being sexy devalues the person who wears them. </p><p> </p><p>so be accepting of your glasses, don,t use language such as milk bottles to describe them, it will distroy your confidence when wearing them.

In this, they appear to accept the finding of GR Thornton, reported in "the effect of wearing glasses on judgments of personality traits of persons seen briefly" (Journal of Applied Psychology, 1944), that observers tended to score spectacle-wearers more highly in terms of intellect. Alas, they must have missed the belated rebuttal of Thornton by K Edwards, in his essaty "The effects of sex and glasses on attitudes towards intellengence and attractiveness" (PsychologyReport, 1987), in which female spectacle-wearers were judged as less successful when rated on task-specific scales, proving that such responses are gender-guided. Men, in short, assume that bespectacled women are stupid. Even more so, one would imagine, if they don't need them to see.

<p><b>Lucky Man!</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2005, 18:45</p><p>When I met my wife 14 years ago, she was 18 and had about -1.25D of astigmatism. She had contacts that she wore occasionally, but hardly ever wore glasses. She hated how she looked in them. While we were dating, I convinced her that she looked good in her glasses so she started wearing them more. After about two years, she started wearing them fairly regularly since she started getting headaches when she didn't wear them for long periods of time. </p><p> </p><p>This mostly full time wear lasted for about the next 8 years or so, with almost no change in her prescription. She used contacts occasionally, but never made the adjustment to them fully. She wore glasses most of the time to prevent headaches and for convenience, but took them off when they were inconvenient - if it was hot out, if she was exercising, social occasions, etc. She knew I thought she looked good in glasses, but she never knew I had a fetish. </p><p> </p><p>About 4 years ago, her prescription took a jump to about -0.75D of myopia along with -1.75D of astigmatism. She started to need her glasses for most activities and gradually became more and more dependant on them. I also told her around this time about my fetish. To my delight, although she thought it strange, she started keeping her glasses on during sex and indulging me.  </p><p> </p><p>Her latest prescription is about -1.25D of myopia along with the -1.75D of astigmatism. She puts her glasses on in the morning and doesn't take them off until she goes to sleep. She needs them for pretty much everything and considers them a part of her look. She currently has 4 pairs of glasses, including a couple of thick-framed black plastic ones that she bought at my request. She continues to wear them during sex and seems to get a kick out of teasing me with them. </p><p> </p><p>What can I say, I love my wife!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mike</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2005, 23:10</p><p>Hmmmnn, sounds like he's trying to control what you do or wear, and i think that is a poor sign for the future.  Tell him boldly that is the way it is , and if he continues tell him to take a hike, then it is not true love, but conditional and not worth fostering!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Matthew</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2005, 20:19</p><p>Hollie - I don't think your bf's attitude is very sensible.  Of course, it depends on a couple things, sort of.  Do you have anti-reflective coating on your lenses?  If you do, I don't see how glasses would obscure your eyes...I would think they would *frame* your eyes (that's why they call them "frames").   And, are your frames a really good fit for your face?  If they are, I think they would enhance your appearance, not detract.  It seems more like he's not interested in change, or he has some issues with glasses; aesthetically, there's nothing necessarily wrong with glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hollie</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2005, 16:25</p><p>Hi ehpc, </p><p>I used to have black frames when I had blonde hair (that was a phase..I have naturally dark brown hair) but the brown ones looked better with my current hair colour. My bf is not that pleased actually. He does wear glasses fulltime himself but is not keen on me wearing them because he says they obscure my eyes and make me look less attractive because they are something on my face thats not supposed to be there....if that makes sense!!! (Not sure if it does to me....) His first comment when I decided on fulltime was that I had managed without them for all that time....not the comment I was hoping for....so why was I wearing them now? But lots of others have been complimentary....a friend tonight in the pub said I looked much better with my glasses because it looked like i could actually see! Not sure how to take that comment but hey..... it can't be that bad!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Luce</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2005, 06:48</p><p>I basically went blind in October...but refused to believe it. Because noone else in my family has ever worn glasses I didn't think it possible. My driving has improved so much since wearing glasses, my optician was scared when I told him I drove! I'm still not sure how my eyesight got so bad so suddenly. Maybe it had been deteriorating for a while, the last time I saw as clearly as I can see now was ages ago. I suppose living without glasses since October I'd got used to going around not really seeing things!  </p><p>I asked another of my friends, who has been wearing glasses for a while, to try mine on. I wondered how strong/weak my eyes were in comparison. She was shocked because apparently my glasses seemed stronger than hers. Slightly worrying...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bruce</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2005, 06:45</p><p>Nope, not at all on the half-frames </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2005, 01:17</p><p>Hi Luce, If you are -2.75 you might be struggling to get around London.  I'm -3.25 and -3.50 and after years and years am still a bit self-conscious.  But even I need to wear to get around London, at least if I have to go on tube etc.  You rx is a bit weaker than mine of course though it's quite high for a first time gwg.  How did you manage with driving, cinema etc. before you got the specs?  Must be SO much clearer now.  Bet you were thrilled when you left the optician's wearing them for first time!  If a see a girl squinting round here, it could just be you!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SMB</b>&nbsp;02 Feb 2005, 11:28</p><p>I think that glasses are very sexy.  I always wanted to wear glasses but I always tested out at 20/15 for the school nurse and during physical exams straight through college.  The best that I could do was to ask to try on one of my friend's glasses and wear them until she wanted them back.  This was usually quicker than I liked.  It always felt so cool to wear them.  I became obsessed.  Last fall, I had a physical exam and deliberately missed some of the letters on the doctor's chart on the 20/40 line.  I got a referral to an optometrist.  I was very nervous about being caught but also a bit turned on.  Finally the day came and I again deliberately missed some of the letters on the lines that he put on the wall when the letters seemed to be small but not too small.  The doctor started to test me for lenses and I was so scared that I was going to get caught with plain glass.   </p><p>I was given a prescription to wear as needed for distance.  I think that the doctor may have figured me out but I got the prescription and that is all I cared about.  I didn't get it filled there and have to wait so I went straight to the mall and picked out a pair of frames at Lens Crafters and got my glasses that day.  I love my glasses! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Luce</b>&nbsp;02 Feb 2005, 09:56</p><p>2 weeks...not very long. I wear them almost all the time, except when I was travelling around London today. Maybe there is still some self-consciousness there, lol. As I get more used to them I'll wear them all the time, I prefer being able to see!  </p><p>Not sure about my Rx but I remember the number -2.75 being written down, if that's what you mean. I should find out... </p><p>Glad GWG aren't completely ignored by males, lol. It was a fear.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speclover</b>&nbsp;01 Feb 2005, 02:35</p><p>Luce, Are you a new gwg?  How long have you been wearing glasses?  Do you wear fulltime?  What's your rx?  Don't be surprised that you get compliments.  We men always prefer a girl with glasses.  Hope you are enjoying wearing and getting extra attention!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2004, 01:37</p><p>Hi anonymous poster; nice that you have both discovered the delights of a bespectacled partner. Why did your girlfriend want  you to have your eyes checked? Did she think you weren't seeing properly or was she hoping to get you into glasses? You don't say anything about your prescriptions - either of them - or even whether you're long or short sighted. people here like to know about things like that! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;25 Dec 2004, 18:41</p><p>Have been going with my girlfriend for almost nine months and I have never seen her with her glasses as she always wear contacts. She went for her yearly eye exam and asked me to go with her to the optomitrist. After her exam she told me that he advised her to restrict wearing her contacts only for special occassions.  I helped her select a beautiful pair of black rectangular plastic frames and a oval rimless pair. When she picked them up I told her I loved the way she looked in them. She insisted that I get my eyes examined and afer the exam I was prescribed my first pair of glasses.   She helped me select an attractive frame and likes when I wear them.   </p><p>We find each other quite sexy and attractive while wearing glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

I only have a low Rx (maybe my Rx is not interesting for you) so I keep wondering what is possible to see with higher Rx... </p><p>Any way Im a typical italian boy, I have got black hair and brown eyes and (if u are interested) I wear metal rectangular frames... </p><p>What about you KS?

<p><b>KS</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2004, 23:12</p><p>Hi Alm, I love seeing glasses on a guy, as long as they choose the right type of frames. I enjoy wearing my glasses everyday.  My bf says that I look naked without them.  I feel that behind the right frames, glasses make the wearer look mysterious. We always wonder what they look like without their glasses on, and how they see with and without their glasses.   These days, glasses are like pieces of jewels in front of eyes.  I am from the San Francisco Bay Area.  If lenschat gets opened again, maybe we can chat.  Have fun.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KS</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2004, 00:30</p><p>Roger, how did you manage to take someone's glasses without them knowing about it to try them on in secret.  I think that most people would know that their glasses were missing.  At least that you were nice enough to return them.  Do you now have a pair of your own, or are you still playing around with other people's glasses.  I used to try on my friend's glasses back in high school.  The minus lenses were what I enjoyed trying on the most.  I am in college now and my glasses are in the -4.75 range.  I still enjoy wearing my friends' glasses at times, her prescription is close to mine, so we have traded glasses for hours at a time.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>J. Ellis</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2004, 21:33</p><p>One other thought to add...

There was a girl I always saw around school who was in the 4th grade.  She was chubby and wore large plastic drop temples with really strong plus lenses (I would estimate her prescription at the time to be somewhere between +8 and +10). </p><p> </p><p>I used to love seeing her when we were all out in the schoolyard and how, as she was running and playing, her big glasses would slide down her nose.  Then (especially in the Winter), she would always systematically wipe her nose and then push her glasses back up. </p><p> </p><p>Also... I got really envious of one kid in my class who didn't wear glasses for so long, and then one day he showed up in a large pair of square plastic frames with, again, a prescription I would guess around +8 or so.  His glasses were slightly too big for his face, and they were so thick and heavy that he had to have a strap going around the back of his head to hold them onto his face!   </p><p> </p><p>I just thought how cool it was that the lenses magnified his eyes so tremendously... From then on, I wanted my own glasses.  I'm still waiting :-P</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>shortsighted</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2004, 02:48</p><p>Reading the post from Gordo reminded me of the time my school held eyesight tests. I was 13 at the time. Prior to the test, I had spent months trying to get together with the girl who sat next to me in school. Her name was Liz, and at that age, I thought this is love. Anyway, we both went in together to see the nurse for our test. She passed with flying colours, where I failed in a big way. This was not really a surprise, I had been struggling with the blackboard for some time. Anyway, the result was that I was told that a letter would be sent to my parents, suggesting they take me for an eyetest. A Week later, There I was in school with my brand new pair of glasses. There was no way I was going to put them on in front of everybody, more so in front of the love of my life. I was told that I was shortsighted and really needed to wear my glasses. As soon as I got out of the house, off they came, and went to the bottom of my satchel. I had not reckoned without my Mothers planning. She had been in contact with my teacher and informed her that I had now got glasses, and was to wear them full time. Would she please ensure that I did this. I will never forget that first morning, after the roll call was made, the teacher announced that as a result of our eye exam, one of the class needed to wear glasses. She said it was no big deal, and the rest of the class shoud not make rude comments, because it could happen to them at any time. Then she said "Francis, stand up and put your glasses on, and keep them on"  It was one of the worse moments of my life. But the part that was really hurt was at the break, Liz came over to me in the playground and stated that there was no way she was going to go out with me now that I wore glasses. I had forgot all about this over the years, and now I was 22 and so used to wearing glasses, I never even thought about putting them on. The funny part of the story was when I went to a Schoold re-union around this time. I hadn't intended to go, but had fell out with my girlfriend and was a loose end. </p><p>The eveing went well, it was nice meeting old friends and swapping stories about our life. During one such conversation, I looked over to the bar area, and you can guess who I spotted. She had her back to me, but there was no mistake that it was Liz. The way she wore her hair and stood, left me in little doubt. The shock came when she turned around. She was wearing very thick magnified glasses, really one of the thickest lenses I had seen on a young girl. Of course, I made a point of getting into conversation with her and asked her what was with the glasses. I also made her squirm by reminding her of what she said to me when I had to wear them. She admitted that was the first thing she thought of when she was told that she was suffering from severe hypermetropia. Upon getting her first glasses, she said she thought how cruel she was to me. She said she had been wearing them for nearly 5 years now, and they just got stronger and stronger. Her eyes looked really large behind the lenses. </p><p>Sorry to have gone on so long, but the end result is Liz and myself are now engaged and are to be married in the sping of next year. I told her, she still looks beautiful with or without her glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2004, 07:15</p><p>KS, </p><p> </p><p>Early on at my workplace, my coworkers were all surprised about my penchant for wearing so many pairs of glasses (one at a time, LOL), but in the past 10 years or so, they've been used to it.  Only when I've worn a pair there for the first time do they seem to notice. </p><p> </p><p>GWG's,  </p><p> </p><p>I managed to find a pair of "modern" cat's-eyes 3 years ago, and due to the lack of big bold frames available now, that was the last new pair I bought, so I'm "stuck" at 30.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2004, 23:44</p><p>Wow, Melyssa, you just get better and better don't you. I also have a rather large collection, that my g/f used to wear in and out of the bedroom. </p><p> </p><p>Like you Gordo, i can remember the first girl i found attractive was at school when i was about 16. She was about two years older than me. I found her stunning before she was a gwg but one day she turned up wearing "modern" cat eye glasses!!! </p><p> </p><p>I couldn't take me eyes off her, and to this day am not still in awe of her, but am amazed at her choice of her frames.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gordo</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2004, 20:29</p><p>Recently I think I traced my glasses fetish to its origin. I remember in third or fouth grade during the school eye screening, this girl and I were sent to have our eyes checked togather. For some reason they sent us to the nurse in pairs. I went first and did fine, then she went and failed miserably. I still to this day do not know how she avoided detection from her familly and teachers. I recall one of her eyes only being able to see the top letter. The other eye was a little better, but not much. I remember feeling sorry for her when the nurse told her that she would call her parents. Since then, she has worn glasses evey time I have seen her. In retrospect, her eyes probably kept getting worse, because she got a new pair of glasses every year. I always thought it was cool that I was there when she was outed. Anyone else able to trace there interest in glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KS</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2004, 20:17</p><p>Melyssa, it sounds like you enjoy wearing your glasses a lot.  What do you co-workers say when you switch to different pairs of glasses at work?  One day, I will be as confident as you when it comes to wearing my glasses.  have fun.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2004, 08:18</p><p>Yes, KS, they are all in my prescription, and I wear (eyewear?) 4-5 pairs a day, including 2 at work each day.  Of course, the bold cat's-eyes and extremely large drop-temples are not part of my work glasses.  Why am I mentioning work on a Saturday?  LOL  But I do enjoy wearing glasses because I have so many and vice-versa.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KS</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2004, 08:08</p><p>Melyssa, 30 pairs, that quite a few pairs of glasses.  Are they all your current prescription?  At least you can wear a different pair each day of the month.  I only have four different pairs, one being prescription sunglasses.  I like your attitude, if one gets smeared, then it's off to the next pair.  I didn't realize that so many people wear their glasses when making love.  I thought that was an unreasonable request when I first heard it.  Oh well, next time I will have an open mind on the subject.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2004, 07:39</p><p>You bet I find glasses sexy, having 30 pairs, and I've always worn them when making love.  They help me see what's going on, and my husband absolutely adores me in them.  And if my glasses get smeared, it's on to the next pair.  :)  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KS</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2004, 19:47</p><p>Alm, I guess that it depends on the person.  For me, the glasses are usually off or somewhere on the bed by the time orgasm hits.  Also, the lights are dim anyway, so it doesn't really matter if I wear my glasses or not.  But I will keep that in mind the next time a guy asks me to keep my glasses on.  Thanks for your input.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2004, 03:15</p><p>I can't really explain HOW i and others find it sexy, but i just do. </p><p> </p><p>Add glasses to nearly ANY ordinary girl, and it makes them a babe in my eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Quite a few girls i have known, or seen regularly, have looked very plain until they have sported glasses, and its just something that gets me going.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alm</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2004, 02:59</p><p>Dear KS, </p><p> </p><p>one of my ex-girlfriends was quite a lot nearsighted (-6.50 -7, blonde, with brown eyes, plastic roundish frames with the lenses sticking out a bit) in the first couple of months we were together she used to wear contacts more than glasses, once she came round to my house she had glasses on, and I loved it, I love girls with glasses, to my eyes she looked even more beautiful than what she was already.    </p><p>Any way I got turned on straight away, we started kissing and touching eachother everywhere and I asked her to keep her glasses on while we were having sex. She agreed, she was very happy to please me during sex, and i promise you that being in bed with a girl with glasses, is absolutely amazing, I used to love her glasses moving and sliding down her nose while we were in bed (I still love it now...).I had really great sex with that girl, amazing, she used to enjoy as well wearing glasses in bed for me and she wore them most of the times we slept together(we have been together 1 year and half). Any way now I need your opinion about a thing: my ex-girlfriend used to ask me to take her glasses off when she was getting near to the orgasm, because she told me that she wanted to go "blind" because she could feel the orgasm coming even more not being able to see? By the way I was happy to do that for her... </p><p> </p><p>A big kiss to you KS and hello to everybody else</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KS</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2004, 19:47</p><p>Gwgs, I never knew that glasses were so erotic until I stumbled onto this site.  I guess to each their own.  I still don't get the fascination of wearing glasses while having sex, the glasses eventually come off during the action, plus you are risking breaking them during the fun.  Maybe you can tell me, why guys find glasses so exciting during sex.  For me, I would rather take my glasses off and leave them off during the fun.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maggie</b>&nbsp;23 May 2003, 08:48</p><p>Alan, </p><p>     I forgot the second part of your question. </p><p>I wear glasses for 100% of my waking hours (well very nearly). </p><p>Can't get contacts to satisfactorily correct my astigmatism. </p><p>I did try a (genuinely prescribed) GOC combination when I was about 18 to 20 years old. This involved wearing soft contacts to correct 75% of my spherical error with glasses for the rest of the sphere and all the astigmatism. </p><p>There were several problems with this, not least the glasses were still pretty strong and quite thick. They were about -3 sphere and -4 cyl and not hi index which looked a bit weird. Also I couldn't see the contacts at all to put them in (and I mean I could literally see no trace of them in their containers). Finally I just couldn't get along with contacts, I never reached a point where I wasn't concious of them in my eyes. Most of the time they were just plain uncomfortable. I gave in eventually and reverted back to full time glasses wear which I've done since I was 3 years old and I am quite happy to continue doing so. </p><p> </p><p>Bye again,</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maggie</b>&nbsp;23 May 2003, 08:23</p><p>Hi Alan, </p><p>       I got a new prescription a few weeks ago and was a little alarmed to see that my right eye had increased by 0.75 D after being stable for five or six years.

<p><b>Maggie</b>&nbsp;22 May 2003, 09:25</p><p>Hi. Didn't quite know where to post this but here goes anyway. </p><p> </p><p>I found this site a few weeks ago have spent a while 'lurking' and reading lots of the old posts. It's been a revelation! You people have confirmed what I sort of suspected, that some folks are into glasses in big way. A couple of guys I have been with in the past appeared to have a bit of a 'thing' about my glasses (which to put it mildly are a bit on the strong side). I had never heard of OO's or a glasses fetish but looking back that's exactly what these guys must have been/had. Their slightly 'odd' behaviour (I don't mean this in a nasty way) all falls into place now. So thank you all for enlightening me. </p><p> </p><p>I have always thought of my glasses as a necessary evil, something that I have to wear just to be able to see and function normally. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway sorry for rambling on. The site's fascinating and there's loads more posts that I still have to read through read through. Thanks again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;09 May 2003, 16:13</p><p>Hi Minic </p><p> </p><p>Im a girl who likes glasses.  Im 17 and my new RX is 6 (until 2 months ago it was 5).  My glasses look great on me, both frames and lenses.  I might not be typical because Im an optical obsessive, but I think glasses dress up the appearance of any good looking boy or girl.  My boyfriend is 1 and his frames are cool but his lenses are very plain and they would look better if they were 4; I hope he goes up.  I find stronger minus lenses visually more interesting because I like looking at the power rings, cut-in and minification that plus lenses or weak minus lenses dont have.  Also, the front surfaces of my new glasses are starting to flatten out, which makes the reflections larger, which I also find attractive.  A lot of kids in my school like glasses, especially trying each others glasses on.  When kids try my glasses on, they are amazed that I can see anything through them, everything looks very small and moves from side to side when they turn their heads.  But theyre perfect for me.  I wouldnt want to go over 10, though, because the lenses would start to become too thick and overwhelming.  For me, the sexiest zone is from 4 to 10. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

I've had this obsession for over 30 years, and until I found ES while surfing for photos of celebs in glasses, I honestly thought I was a freak. I've since learned it's a very common thing. Yes, there seem to be more men obsessing over GWG, and most of the posts about BWG seem to be from gay men, but I don't mind sharing with them, we're all in this together!</p><p></p><hr>

I get that very same line being "obsessed" by glasses, being closely watched every time we pass women wearing glasses everywhere we go,  my wife even constantly checks history on our computer to see if I was visiting any GWG sites. And honestly I am not looking for any affair I just find women wearing glasses very attractive and real turn on but being honest with her didn't help that much,  my only hope is maybe her needed glasses more or living as so far in my secret little world with at least now thanks to the internet being able visit ES and share my thoughts with others who may be little bit more little understanding. I just asways keep thinking is this just mainly male "obsession" or are there any females who would go through the same, like enjoying wearing glasses,  wanted to wear stronger lenses,  finding attractive guys in glasses? I was always wondering about it and I would really appretiate if I can get some comments, pref. of course from some  girls.  Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

For most of the time, she didn't even own a pair of glasses. Well, now that we are divorced, she is wearing glasses all the time. I think after all those years, her eyes got to where they couldn't tolerate the contacts and now she always has her glasses on and they're pretty thick too. Almost makes me wish we were still married. ... Well, not really.</p><p></p><hr>

Eventhough the row over Britney Spears seems to be over now, I remain sure that it'll pop up any time again...What is more is that she has me on a probe period, she's monitoring every single look of mine at any girl wearing glasses in real life or on tv... </p><p>This makes it really difficult, she doesn't want to give in to my liking of glasses and forbids me from looking away from her...I am frankly very keen to get older enough to see her finally give up to the need to wear plus glasses for close up vision as she reaches 40s or so... </p><p>Thanks folks for all your comments.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sandy</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2003, 22:36</p><p>Lore, I have to agree with you fully.  I too am a full time glasses wearer that has never tried contacts.  There are plenty of advantages to contacts over glasses.  I have friends who swear by contacts, they don't have to worry about losing their glasses while playing sports.  Also, in plenty of social situations, many prefer contacts to glasses.  I choose to wear glasses everyday, I have several pairs to choose from depending on the occasion.  I am lucky because my prescription is not thick as some of the others here.  But between smaller frames and hi-index lenses, I don't mind wearing glasses everyday.  The only time that I wish that I didn't have to wear glasses is while I ski or play beach volleyball in the summer.  Wearing glasses under goggles in not fun especially if it is snowing outside.  Also, being hit in the head with a volleyball is not fun either.  I think that it should be up to each individual whether he or she wears glasses or not.  Take care. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Daffy</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2003, 21:42</p><p>While on the 'contact lenses' topic...I find that when people get to a certain age, they give up on contacts. Sure the contacts are predominantly marketed to the young adults and teens, what about the 'older' market. Is there a general age pattern where people just 'give-up' contacts and turn to glasses? They all eventually do...even I did (at age 31).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2003, 20:25</p><p>LikeGlass, </p><p> </p><p>I totally get what you are saying.  But, and maybe I'm just a stickler for the line between fantasy and reality, I do think there is a difference between admiring women who choose to wear glasses, fantasizing about women wearing glasses (whether they exist in real life or not, whether they are real-life glasses wearers or not), and actively working to discourage someone who wants to wear contacts from wearing them are very different things.  The first two I'm totally fine with, but I really don't think anyone should try to talk a real-life woman who is choosing or has chosen contacts into wearing glasses, particularly if there is a compelling reason for her to wear contacts (i.e., having a small child, having a high prescription, spending a lot of time outdoors, etc.).  It's one thing to discourage someone from LASIK, because it is potentially very dangerous.  It is another thing to try to talk someone out of a decision they have made because of an aesthetic preference, but that's JMHO.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ralph</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2003, 20:20</p><p>You mean -48 diopters?!?!?!?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2003, 20:00</p><p>Lore, </p><p>Few things that are "sexy" are practical. For example, is there any good reasons to wear six inch stiletto heels?  Is a thong bathing suite comfortable? How about false eyelashes, make-up, or my own favorite, large hoop earrings? Truth be know, sexy and practical are usually diametrically opposed. Many guys would go bonkers over a pair of 48D's , but few girls would ever want to live with the back pain! You can add glasses to the list. Yes, contacts are more practical, but for some of us, glasses are just more sexy! Should girls who wear contacts get bashed here? No. But, this is a room populated by many guys who like girls in glasses, the reaction could be predicted.  It would be the same as going to a site dedicated to high heels, and talking about how it is more practical to wear sandals.  </p><p>Yesterday, I twisted my neck out, looking at a cute girl with glasses and wearing a pair of 4 inch hoop earrings. It still hurts! So, I guess sexy (sometimes) is not practical on either side. (But it sure is fun!) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2003, 18:43</p><p>You know, I often feel the need to stick up for contact lens wearers here.  There seems to be a belief that women who wear contacts are doing it either 1) to be more attractive or 2) to frustrate OOs ;).  But, while there is probably some #1 in their decisions, there actually are a lot of benefits to wearing contacts. </p><p> </p><p>As someone who must wear correction full-time, I can tell you that there are a lot of very good reasons for choosing contacts: </p><p> </p><p>For one thing, with even marginally high prescriptions (anything above -5 or so), you don't have to deal with minification with contacts, which makes reading easier.  I imagine that only increases as you get older. </p><p> </p><p>If you live in a sunny area, being able to easily put on sunglasses is a *big* plus, particularly if you drive a lot or work outdoors.  I worked at a summer camp for years, and each summer when I worked there, I'd wear contacts, because I was outside a lot, and liked the convenience of being able to put sunglasses on and off without having to keep track of where my other glasses were.  Plus, if you are prone to losing sunglasses, losing a $10 pair of cheap non-prescription sunglasses is a far, far less big deal than losing a $200 pair of prescription sunglasses.  I actually have prescription sunglasses now, but it's kind of annoying to have to change between them and my glasses a lot, particularly when I'm just driving a short distance.  Wearing contacts and putting on sunglasses would be much easier. </p><p> </p><p>For women who have small children, or work with small children, contacts are very, very useful.  Small children have a habit of pulling your glasses off of your face, or smacking you in the side of the head so they get crooked, or throwing balls at you that knock your glasses right off.  While these may seem like erotic scenarios to some of you, if you are trying to take care of your own child (or several of other people's children), it is quite inconvenient.  Plus, you have to have a pretty sturdy pair of glasses to make sure they don't break, since kids can yank at them pretty good.  I have no doubt that the reason a lot of women wear contacts is because of this.  Really, if you need your glasses to see, you do not want to deal with an infant or young child tugging at them all the time.  Contacts are much, much easier.  I actually think I'll probably be likely to switch back to contacts when I have a child, if it turns out my child is a glasses-yanker. </p><p> </p><p>Contacts go with everything.  Glasses, in general, do not.  Of course, one of the great benefits of small wire frames (the bane of so many of you here), is that they do indeed match with most outfits.  But, there are still times when you are wearing something that your glasses just don't go with (bridesmaid's dresses, anyone?), and contacts eliminate this completely.  I don't think this is vanity.  In many situations, a woman has to look professional in order to be taken seriously in her profession.  For some jobs, like mine, glasses can enhance this, but I have no doubt that, in others, glasses can be a drawback.  Contacts give a flexibility that is not available with glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Contacts are almost entirely safe.  Nearly everyone I know (both male and female) wears contacts.  I have never known *anyone* who had a serious eye infection from them.  They are safe.  They are more secure than glasses, since they will never fall or be knocked off your face.  They actually probably cost less than glasses, if you have a higher prescription and, like most people who do, opt for thin lenses and anti-reflective coatings or if you invest in more expensive frames.  They do not get bent out of shape like glasses do.   </p><p> </p><p>Contacts in general also give better vision, in most cases (apparently not when you need prism correction or have a lot of astigmatism).  But, for the nearsighted, contacts give you excellent peripheral vision, which glasses, even ones with large frames, do not.  Contacts do not cause distortions like glasses do.  Many people find that their vision in contacts is noticeably superior to their vision in glasses, and good vision is really what is important, not how attractive a woman looks, whether you like her in glasses or in contacts. </p><p> </p><p>I am a full-time glasses wearer, but it's not because of any ideological opposition to contacts.  It's because 1) I'm too lazy to deal with putting them in and out every day and, primarily, 2) I am a graduate student who is otherwise very un-scholarly looking (I'm curvy and have dark curly hair in a field where most women are stick-thin with long straight hair), so wearing glasses makes me look more academic, which, as a woman, I sometimes need, particularly when dealing with students or older male faculty.  So, really, my reasons are just as superficial as reasons for choosing to wear contacts.   </p><p> </p><p>I can understand why you all might want to see more women wearing glasses, but contacts have a ton of benefits, and I don't think it would be in the best interest of all women to wear glasses.  While I think there can probably be arguments made that LASIK is *not* in most people's best interest, and thus should be discouraged, contacts are not the same.  It's important to remember that women who wear them have a lot of good reasons for it, many of which have nothing to do with wanting to look more attractive!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2003, 18:20</p><p>Ryan - Unfortunately, I don't think you can come up with any great medical case for not wearing contacts; if worn responsibly, they're quite safe and very rarely will ceasing to wear them fail to correct any problems associated with wearing them...Something could happen, but it's very unlikely. </p><p>   I think you have to make your case on convenience and comfort and the positives of wearing glasses.  Most people these days think many people who wear glasses look better with glasses than without - it depends on how well the glasses are chosen, but for the many people who have chosen glasses well, they look great in glasses.  Whether glasses or contacts are more convenient, comfortable, or inexpensive kind of depends on the person and the glasses &amp; contacts in question, but for a lot of people glasses are preferable in this regard and they only want contacts because of very misplaced vanity.  I think you have to focus on this in a tactful way. </p><p> </p><p>Mad Dog - This brainwashing really is quite ironic.  It's the same as the case where so many women think they should be as thin as models, yet most men would find them *less* attractive if they were this thin (rather than at a more reasonable or healthy weight). How bizarre this is!  I definitely wish people (and I guess I'm referring particularly to american women since I'm talking about people I would potentially meet be attracted to) were better at being reasonable in their sense of what others would find attractive.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mad dog</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2003, 09:19</p><p>If a man or a woman is attracted to the wearing of glasses, do we have a way of dousing that interest? If I did not have a wife who wears minus lenses, I'd be in the doghouse a lot, cause I'd be looking at every glasses wearing woman that came by. I can't squelch the interest I have in women who wear glasses, especially myopic ones. I can still remember girls that I saw 15 years ago who looked good with their glasses on. Glasses are sexy; these women who think they are unattractive have been brainwashed somewhere that they are unattractive when they are forced to wear glasses.I guess my wife is a lot more tolerant of my interest in her glasses than other women are. It works out to her advantage and she knows it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>minic</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2003, 20:37</p><p>3Ms, </p><p>I just noticed your older message and have to respond, because I can relate. When I started dating my wife she was just getting glasses,  wearing them at first full time,  than shortly after our marriage decided that she don't really need them. I was really dissappointed,  secretly dreaming about another women in glasses, but never cheated on her. Than suddenly glasses came back and I honestly felt like  finding young mistress, our sex life went up 100% and I was really happy,  than at one point I told her about my fetish and glasses became our leverage tool,  just a special treatment for good behavior, I found my magazine with Anastacia,s interwiev her picture completely scratched out, as soon that there is any fem wearing glasses on TV, my remote is gone and there is another channel,  not to mention our old friends couple,  both wearing glasses are out of our friends list.

<p><b>mad dog</b>&nbsp;25 Apr 2003, 08:54</p><p>My wife and I joke around about Lasik because she knows I'm crazy about her myopia and her absolute dependence on vision correction. She too feels unattractive with her glasses on, therefore she almost always wears her contacts when in public. She will complain about the way they feel and when I suggest she wear glasses, I get a look and the same comment that Hooked said he gets. She's great looking anyway, but with glasses on she's just got that extra little spark that makes her 110 %. I always say that I don't care if she wears contacts and I don't care how much she spends on eyewear, as long as she does not get eye surgery.She tries to stretch her contacts out too far, I think. I'm trying to persuade her to get some new glasses soon, but she'll always come back with the statement that her old ones are still okay.Then there are the times each day when she is putting on her make-up and doesn't have contacts or glasses on and she comes into the kitchen to do something and I get to see her bare-eyed. She calls me a pervert sometimes because she knows I like to watch her, but I think she likes it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;25 Apr 2003, 07:37</p><p>Well, so the storm seems to have passed  3M's - or maybe you are in the eye of the hurricane.  I only wish that my attraction to girls wearing glasses had emerged early in my married life, as it might have changed things.  Now my wife has had laser surgery, and she wears reading glasses. Minus lenses are my turn on, and plus just doesn't do a thing for me - no offense intended for any of those that wear plus lenses, it is just the way my obsession developed. </p><p>However, if you don't care if she wears plus or minus, maybe you could suggest that she try a pair of low plus drugstore readers.  Explain to her that you find her very sexy as she is, but wearing a pair of glasses would make her different, and would make her seem to have a new image.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Teah</b>&nbsp;22 Dec 2002, 08:30</p><p>i agree with Alan that the glasses themselves are a big part of it. generally noticing glasses-wearers, i've found that people wearing ugly glasses, or glasses that do not suit them at all no more attractive or even in some cases less attractive then they would be without them. BUT a nice pair of frames changes EVERYTHING. like you said, it's all about design. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;22 Dec 2002, 00:38</p><p>Teah and Musey -- I like Teah's suggestion of talking about 'what' and maybe getting some glimse of 'why' through that.  But first, as an aside, one could think about 'why' in evolutionary terms -- I think we are sort of wired to find certain things beautiful, and this may well have been an evolutionary product.  Bright colors, symmetry -- things like that -- they (I think) have always been indications of good health, which means these things might have been more likely to be good food or good mating partners, etc. </p><p> </p><p>But about glasses and aesthetics... I'd like to talk to a design person about this.  I think there are broad concepts in design that are used to make it much easier to come up with aesthetically pleasing designs.  (I mean 'design' pretty broadly, applying to things like clothes, cars, buildings, products, and probably fine arts &lt;painting, sculpture&gt; too.)  Concepts like symmetry, complementary colors, proportion, balance - in terms of color, light, proportion, 'weight'.  Now, I'm tempted to point to the growing popularity of glasses and say that this is because current designs are much better balanced to wearers' faces than designs of yesteryear...but then a lot of people will disagree completely.  But anyway, glasses can improve the balance between features on a person's face - as the glasses can be 'heavy' or 'light', round or rectangular, high or low.  This is probably one reason that a lot of people can look better in glasses than without, even to people who aren't particularly interested in glasses.  Glasses can also draw attention away from a face's flaws, or even hide the flaws directly (for example, a big nose often seems smaller with a pair of glasses sitting on them).  None of this addresses the attitude that's common on this site, that glasses themselves are attractive, regardless of how they affect the beauty of the wearer, and the wearer is automatically more attractive by wearing glasses.  This is where aesthetics clearly is impacted by feelings and attitudes that are distinct from the purely visual.  I mean, glasses are fascinating to me, seem to mean something to me, seem to indicate something about a person - something amorphous and not really rational - and all this makes them attractive to me.   </p><p>   There's also a social element -- I think my interest in and attraction to glasses &amp; glasses-wearers has actually grown somewhat since I found this site.  It sort of gave me license not to limit my feelings on the matter, as if it suddenly "wasn't weird".  So that's part of it too. </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Musey</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2002, 01:34</p><p>Yeah Alan, why DO we find certain things asthetically pleasing, I don't know if anyone knows for sure. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>teah</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2002, 18:41</p><p>alan - yes that last post was directed to me and not said to me. about attraction - people don't know why. the brain is just too hard to understand. sorry if i'm being all scientific  and taking psych and all....maybe we should just concentrate on thinking about WHAT exactly makes glasses attractive because maybe we'll come up with a why through discussing the what. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2002, 17:10</p><p>Teah - (Was that last post with your name on it directed *to* you rather than being posted *by* you?)  The limbic system is the part of the brain that controls attraction, but naming it doesn't help me understand anything about why I'm attracted by certain things.  Do you relate to that? But maybe the way the limbic systems works (if we know anything about that) could actually shed light on why we like certain things.  Do you know if there is enough detailed knowledge about the limbic system to suggest much about why certain things become attractive and others don't?    </p><p> </p><p>Musey - I think that weakness hypothesis has a lot to do with it for some people.  I don't think it's the case for me, though; I don't really want a woman to seem "weak" or "needful".  For me, it is based in emotions about vision problems, partly what I imagined (before I knew) what it felt like to have blurry vision without glasses, what it felt like to go to the eye doctor, etc.  And partly my own feelings about discovering what it's like to walk around in a blur and put glasses on and make everything clear.  I don't think it really "makes sense", though; I think the bottom line is that glasses and vision occupied enough of my attention at some point for a 'fetish' to develop; I think this is something that happens spontaneously, particularly for men.   After being "interested" in glasses for a long time, I developed a really strong taste for the appearance of glasses, so now they are visually attractive to me even without thinking about the 'refractive part' (the wearer's experience, the strength of the lenses, etc).  My attraction to glasses at this point, I think, is half the degree to which I focus on them automatically and half the fact that I think stylish, modern, well-fit frames really "work" aesthetically.  This is something that designers and architects understand a little more than other people, but really I think it's a bit myseterious.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Musey</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2002, 22:22</p><p>I just got a thought....hard to define but Ill try. Well when a woman makes love, she submits a part of herself to the man, she becomes weak and very needful of, well, all that man stuff. So couldn't possibly the needing of lenses be symbolic of all that, and evoke a physical reaction from a sensitive male (specifically an OO)? Just as ruby lips subconsciously remind a male of 'other' lips, so might the need for glasses remind a man of the needful state of love making. Ya think?? Now for my love of spexy men, thats another story completely, and one I think harder to explain...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>teah</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2002, 15:16</p><p>while this may be rooted in the limbic system...you may find tight shirts, jewelry, high heels, sandals....etc sexy... </p><p>why not glasses also. i think they're great!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>teah</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2002, 15:13</p><p>yeah...i'm a dork who takes pych in school. right soooo </p><p>you have this part of brain called your limbic system. what that controls is exactly what kind(s) of people you find yourself attracted to. this is explains why so many people are attracted to people who on the outside may not seem right for them, why some men like skinny girls and others like voluptuous ones. it also affects what kind of personality you look for in a significant other.  </p><p>and of course it explains why you naturally feel so attracted to girls in glasses without even having met them before hand :) </p><p>there probably is a psychological explanation for why your limibic system reacts to certain characteristics but it's different for every person. sometimes it has a definate root (someone you once loved or admired had that characteristic for example) sometimese psychologists are just puzzled.  </p><p>the brain's a complicated thing man</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2002, 15:05</p><p>Ok, lets get right to the heart of this matter. (Intended to start a new conversation) Just what makes glasses sexy? How can two little disks of plastic or glass, supported in some form of frame ADD to the sexuality of a woman? It makes no sense to me, yet, there it is! I find an extra jump in my heart when I see a cute girl in glasses, and thee is no question that the jump is sexual in nature! So, take a cute girl, add glasses, and what just happened? Why is she now more sexually attractive?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>teah</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2002, 06:15</p><p>SZ6 - i fence foil. i'd love to try epee but we don't have a team...i also note that the myopia-fencing correlation is stronger in guys then girls. about half the girls wear glasses whereas almost 90% of the guys are myopic. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SZ6</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2002, 22:32</p><p>Actually, Teah's post about fencing brought back memories of my freshman year of college, when I was but a newbie foilist on the men's team...there was a tall, very cute blonde on the woman's team who often wore large, roundish blue plastic glasses with a pretty high minus prescription.  Unfortunately, the men's and women's teams didn't practice together and didn't socialize much outside of the gym...and by next year, she was gone, probably graduated.  Alas.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2002, 21:40</p><p>Teah -- If you pick the right frame, guys won't be any less interested in you, even if they're not OO's at all.  I'm quite certain about this.  Plus, I think it's a turnoff if you can't see, which at your prescription is a genuine concern, I think. </p><p> </p><p>I haven't seen any Sandler pics on the web, but perhaps I'll get a chance to look sometime. </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

There is only one wish I have for a spexy Christmas--a cute slightly myopic guy-with-glasses. One with a lowish Rx so he can squint around in the house but just strong enough that he needs them to get around while shopping, to see the tv in a bar and of course for movies and driving. Perhaps some rimless frames, a discreet pair as he may be a bit shy about wearing his specs sometimes. </p><p>It would help if he was smart, thoughtful, interesting and fun to be with...but I'm not picky :-)  </p><p> </p><p>Signed, Kix</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2002, 12:43</p><p>It was the least I could do. By the way, I'm sure you've probably told us before, but what is your prescription?...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>teah</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2002, 12:38</p><p>thank you :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2002, 09:07</p><p>Fair comment, teah. Apologies - and of course you're right.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>teah</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2002, 09:06</p><p>you say you'd like your ideal girl to be undercorrected but i don't know any girl who would want that. please take into account the well-being of the girl herself --- people like to see clearly you know</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2002, 05:35</p><p>OK, this is silly... </p><p> </p><p>Christmas is coming...and we haven't had any posts to this topic for ages. So...what would be our perfect gwg from Father Christmas??  </p><p> </p><p>Obviously glasses...but what sort of frames? what kind of prescription? does this fantasy-gwg wear them all the time, or sometimes use contacts (makes the glasses days even nicer so long as they come along reasonably often). Bifocals might be nice, but they are very unusual on 20-30 year olds in the UK (and that's the age range I have in mind for the dream gwg).  </p><p> </p><p>And what else? </p><p> </p><p>I love very slightly crossed eyes behind strong-ish minus lenses (say minus 10)...don't mind if they are high-index or regular - the script is obvious either way and though a lot of thickness is nice, so is knowing just how strong a gwg's glasses need to be by looking at minification etc. Ideally she would regularly use two different pairs - that's always fun - and maybe one would have thinned lenses and the other would be good chunky old standard plastic.  </p><p> </p><p>And maybe just slightly under-corrected so that distance vision is a slight problem even with very strong specs. That's always a lovely thing to see... </p><p> </p><p>Other things which would help?...Personally, I do like to see a pretty girl with hearing aids, but the trouble is that most of the pretty deaf girls I know hide them very successfully with long hair - but then long hair (preferably brown) is certainly part of the magic mixture for me. Even so it would be nice to know that they were (significantly) hard of hearing and to get the odd glimpse of plastic behind the ears... </p><p> </p><p>What else? How about a sexy lisp - or a slight stammer? And of course all of this needs to be wrapped up in a nice body (for me, that means she probably thinks she's a few pounds overweight and everyone that ever sees her in a good pair of jeans knows otherwise) - and, crucially, said gwg needs to be equipped with a lot of brains, a lovely sense of humour etc. etc. </p><p> </p><p>OK. That's esentially what would go in my letter to Father Christmas. Anybody else want to do better? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>S-type</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2002, 13:09</p><p>Several years ago I was working in this small corner food store. It was raining cats and dogs outside. These two girls about 20 y/o then walked in. One had on fairly strong glasses. Once inside the store the glasses girl said "oh! I hate this and removed her glasses.Her friend turned to her and said, What's the matter ? The glasses girl said "I don't have nothing to wipe these off with. So her friend said "here let me see" then took the glasses out of her hand and came over to the counter and got a paper napkin off the counter and went about cleaning the glasses. (Paper is not good for cleaning glasses.) While clinging the glasses the friend walked a bit about the small store looking at things on the shelves. She then said "Cassey come here, look at this" Cassy without her glasses on kind of squints and walks over to her friend. Cassey said "what"? Her friend goes "Look at this. No! __ this!__ thissss here"!  Cassey leans foward while squinting and says "I can't see anything". The friend then says "oh, here". and gives Cassey back her glasses. But Cassey didn't put her glasses back on right then. She turned for the door and I watched as she went back outside in the rain and put her glasses on. The poor kid. I guess she was so embarrassed. Now, this must have been Cassey's best friend but that girl was so oblivious or insensitive to her friend's vision without glasses on.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2002, 19:54</p><p>Alan, </p><p>The 10mm is on the 16 side, the -12 is about 8mm. No anti-reflective coating. Without the bevel they would be way too thick, probably 15 and 12mm so the bevel looks quite good. Yes, I have had myodiscs before and I am trying to get some in this prescription so I can have CR-39 plastic which still gives the very best vision, although these are very good. This lab said they don't do myodiscs so they did the pair I requested as myos in biconcave CR-39 and the -16 side is 18mm thick even with a pretty severe bevel. Those really need to be myodiscs! The quest continues. I have always liked the myodiscs because they fit really close to my eyes and probably give the best vision. I'll let you know how the search for the myodiscs goes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2002, 19:33</p><p>RL, </p><p>   Do they have an anti-reflective coating?  And is the 10mm the -16 or the -12 side? (I'd think there'd be a fair amount of difference between the two eyes, given the difference in Rx.) </p><p>   Do you think the beveling makes them look better or worse? </p><p>   Did you have myo's before?  Which do you prefer at this point?  It sounds like these came out pretty good. </p><p>   Oh, one other question: what do you think of the eye size?  50 mm sounded pretty big to me for this prescription -- do they seem to fit your face well? </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for the update.

<p><b>Emma</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2002, 17:40</p><p>RL, </p><p>Thanks for the information about polycarbonate lenses. They sound excellent from your description - and obviously a very good idea, since the cosmetic issues with standard plastic make those impossible except as a totally last resort, as you say. I don't know where you live? I'm in Britain and here they seem make myodiscs without any problem. Good luck with your search.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2002, 17:30</p><p>Emma, </p><p>The polycarbonate glasses came in and are amazingly free of distortion. They are about 10mm thick at the edges even though they are very sharply beveled. But they don't look too bad and give good vision. The Myodiscs are another matter, this lab doesn't do myos so they did the plastic (CR 39) lenses in a biconcave and even at that they turned out to be close to 20mm thick in spite of very severe beveling. I am going to look for some lab that can make a proper myodisc. Hard to find.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2002, 02:52</p><p>I totally agree with you about the looks of a pair of very high index glasses in a strong prescription.  The do indeed look to me like fine jewelry. </p><p>And, unless your prescription increases dramatically Sarah, your prescription will look lovely in a high index plastic.  It is only after you reach the high teens that glass hi index really becomes necessary - but then you have increased weight, and a much higher cost.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lazysiow</b>&nbsp;14 Jul 2002, 00:33</p><p>Yes high index go for it! :) They hold a special fascination for me because they seem like crystals and they look extremely strong and polished at the same time so they don't detract from your apperance (i.e. ew coke bottles) but make you even more mysterious and alluring :) Theres also an aura of mystery to guessing how strong your prescription is since they will look weak front on.

<p><b>Sarah</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2002, 19:02</p><p>Specs4ever, </p><p>   You're absolutely right -- I'd definitely be self-conscious wearing my current glasses out-and-about.  Like a tacky shirt, a tacky pair of glasses is...well, tacky.  Maybe even more attention-getting.  I'm going to see about some high-index glasses, though.  I think I wear my contacts more than is healthy, partly because I don't have a decent alternative. </p><p>   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2002, 04:44</p><p>Well Sarah, I don't really know if the positive attitude about glasses has finally spread from this site to the rest of the world.  I have noticed a definate increase in glasses wearers, both male and female, ranging in age from very young all the way up through the 30's.  The folks with stronger prescriptions, such as yours, are still hiding behind contact lenses for the most part, and it is a rare day that I get a sighting of a nice lady with a prescription such as yours.  That makes my day.  I don't know if I would reccommend you going out amongst your frinds wearing your "super thick" glasses, as I think you would soon start to feel insecure, and that people wer staring at you because of your glasses.  However, I really would suggest that you fork out the money for a nice pair of hi index plastic lenses in your new prescription.  I think you would be pleasantly suprised at how thin they would be, and I think you could wear them proudly.  Good luck, and let us know your progress.</p><p></p><hr>

My ex did limp slightly from a past club foot....gosh he was almost perfect....white thighs like two swans or two birthday cakes! yumm...his face should have a rather somber tone, which breaks into a refreshing smile when he laughs. A longish, straight nose, and a squint in very sexy!

<p><b>Specky-Spice</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2002, 17:34</p><p>Emma, I've been told more than once that my eyes look nice and sparkly when I wear mascara when I've got my glasses on...it's worth an experiment to see if that suits you. My prescrption is not as strong as yours (I'm -11 ish), but my eyes are still noticeably smaller when they are behind my glasses lenses, and the make-up really helps make them look less pathetic! But I agree with other people about getting the rest of your face just right if you're going to try going glammed-up in your specs. It can certainly be done, and on the evidence of recent posts, there will be plenty of people who will notice your glasses for all the best reasons.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2002, 16:28</p><p>Emma, </p><p>Thanks for the info. I will let you know how the polys turn out. Should be in next week.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emma</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2002, 15:54</p><p>Thanks for all the great ideas and the support. Fairly obviously with my degree of short-sight I need to wear my contacts to put make-up on at all, so it's going to be weird getting really nicely made up and then taking my lenses *out* and putting my glasses on! RL, let me answer your question. My lenses are absolutely normal myodiscs (i.e. not the blended ones, which my optician told me were horrible to see out of). Since I don't (or at least haven't) worn them much in public, the cosmetic advantages of the blended ones are completely outweighed by the superb visual clarity of the normal ones. Incidentally, mine are made out of some kind of plastic, but I'm not sure what exactly, and the frames are quite a small oval shape (the ones for my completely normal lenses are even smaller, but the edges are still shockingly thick - emergency use only). I was told polycarbonate might produce problems of blurriness on the periphery with a high prescription like yours and mine, but that's possibly nonsense, and I'd be really interested to know what they are like - I gather they can make them really thin. Meanwhile, I'm off to buy some different eyeliner tomorrow morning!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2002, 14:45</p><p>I do remember seeing a girl around a few years ago with thick plastic specs and lots of makeup. It just seems so lovely to see it all together.

It all adds to the interest and appeal.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2002, 14:26</p><p>Emma, </p><p>I was wondering if your myodiscs are the blended or non-blended kind and what kind of lens material (hi-index, polycarbonate etc) you have in the non-myodisc glasses. My prescription is -16 actually -17 with the astigmatism and I have always had myodiscs but just ordered some polycarbonate lenses and I am wondering if they will be tremendously thick? Any thoughts?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2002, 10:55</p><p>Emma, </p><p> </p><p>I generally don't wear make-up, but when I do, I do wear eye make-up.  I usually go with a tan eyeshadow and black mascara.  I think it makes my eyes look bigger, and as long as I'm happy with how I look, that's all that matters :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2002, 03:38</p><p>Personally I think beautifully made-up eyes behind glasses are just a dream......................the make-up amplifies the 'hey,aren't my glasses sexy' attitude I find very sexy in women.That is my reaction.  Peter   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fathom</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2002, 22:35</p><p>Emma, I personally do wear eye makeup with my glasses (-10 plus astigmatism). I really think it brings out a much better overall effect, and I like experimenting to see what type of makeup works better with different types (and colours) of frames.  If you do the eye makeup right, you'll lessen the minification effect.  If you do it wrong, you'll make them look even smaller!  And I take ENORMOUS care in choosing my frames, plus my lenses are not at all thick.  At 1.9 index glass, the edges barely peek out from the small metal frames.   </p><p> </p><p>I'm not sure what type of glasses you have or how much they minify your eyes, so I can't say specifically if eye makeup would be best for you.  Alan has a good point, though.  Concentrate on the rest of your face, especially your your lips.  I'd choose bolder coloured lipsticks than you'd normally wear without your glasses, and try to wear one that'll complement the colour of your frames.  If you tend to wear blush, I'd try to play up the cheekbones more then usual.  And take care how you line your brows so that the shape complements rather than fights with the top rim of your glasses.  (A good idea to keep in mind when choosing frames....) </p><p> </p><p>There's my two cents...hope that helps!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2002, 21:52</p><p>Emma -- Portia brings up a good point; you may as well 'advertise' the glasses-wearing side of yourself, since any partner will need to be able to accept it (and hopefully will embrace it). </p><p>   Big eyes might be the thing, but I think a pair of thick glasses are a lot more memorable than big eyes.  And *how* you wear a pair of strong glasses will say a lot about you -- people will notice whether you seem confident, whether you seem to have a sense of style, etc. </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if there are optical shops that specialize in strong prescriptions.  Lenses can really change the way a pair of glasses looks, and I've sure seen a lot of frames that were really nice on their own but weren't well suited to a stronger prescription.  If a place wanted to cater to strong prescriptions, they would go beyond pushing super-high-index lenses and A/R coating.  They'd have some polaroid cameras on hand, they'd be able to advise people on the effect the lenses will have on how a frame looks -- maybe they'd even have some examples (frames with real lenses) on hand.  They would take care to make sure thick edges were matched up aesthetically to a frame.  And so on.  I guess this would only work in a really large market (New York, etc), where there would be plenty of people actually willing to wear glasses with strong lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2002, 21:26</p><p>Emma, get used to the fact that there are glasseslovers here and that there just might be glasseslovers out there for you too. </p><p> </p><p>Take pride in wearing them and get used to the fact that once you are married, your husband will have to be a glasseslover or else your life will be miserable.  </p><p> </p><p>Think about the nights when your baby is up until all hours...not appearing in glasses to your love will be very far from your mind, as it should be.  </p><p> </p><p>If a man you are dating doesn't like the glasses, find another.

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2002, 19:59</p><p>Emma, </p><p>  I know you were asking the girls, but I'll chime in anyway -- I'm not a big fan of eye makeup anyway (or any makeup, really), but I'd say if you're going to put effort into makeup, worry less about the eyes and more about the rest of the face.  Glasses, though we all like them, do hide the eyes pretty well.   </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emma</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2002, 16:48</p><p>Hi again. I'm the Emma who posted a couple of weeks ago, partly about why I wear contacts most of the time. It's mainly because with my glasses (which are either myodiscs or very, very thick, around -18.00 - contacts are -16.00) it's hard to imagine how they could be thought of as "sexy" by most people. Well here we are with lots of posts which seem to say that they are (or at least can be -- but in my case we're talking seriously strong lenses...). I always thought big eyes were the thing, and though mine are quite big you'd never know it from looking at me in my glasses, which make my eyes really tiny. There's one other advantage to contact lenses when I'm out and about: I get to see slightly more as everything is actually a bit bigger, and the peripheral vision is far, far better (though when I'm working at the computer I prefer glasses as I can focus better...and because I sometimes like a smoke - and that can make lenses uncomfortable). And now everyone here's saying "wear your glasses with pride". Well I think I just might try it, at least once... But before I do, here's one for the girls: with a prescription like mine is there even any point in thinking about eye makeup when I'm in glasses as opposed to contacts? I haven't thought about doing that for a few years, as it's usually contacts when I'm out socialising as opposed to 9 a.m. lectures...the contacts usually go in a bit after those, but then it's hard to feel self-conscious at that time of day - my usual routine being: wake up, specs on, shower, jeans and top on, make coffee, try to get there in time and - one I just have to live with - try to sit near the front.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Socks</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2002, 00:56</p><p>My ideal women is caucasian, about 5'5" with a fit/athletic figure, not overly muscular or fat, but not too skinny.  Supermodel slim is a total turn off!  The perfect body should be strong and properly curvy without being fat.  Hair color is not important, but I generally prefer a medium length, not too short nor anything past the shoulder blades.  Her glasses would be slightly larger than what seems to be currently popular, 1 pair of metal and 1 of plastic, both dark colored frames not too square, rounded edges are better.  About -8 to -10 in CR39 lenses without polished edges worn at the end of her nose.  She would be athletic, smart and funny, but not moreso than me in any of those areas.  Just as with her glasses, she would happily wear white kneesocks with all her outfits, whether casual, dressy, or athletic.   </p><p> </p><p>I feel EXTREMELY lucky as my girlfriend is SO close to what I just described.

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2002, 18:49</p><p>A few more thoughts on this topic. When I was at university (too many years ago...) I knew a girl called Kim with thick glasses but they weren't a lot of use to her: not only was she very myopic, but because of some serious eye condition she did not have much useful vision even with correction and I think she was officially classified as partially sighted. She didn't "look" blind at all (in fact she had the most beautiful deep blue eyes), but she had only peripheral vision and could only read huge print, even then with difficulty. I always thought she was very sexy to look anyway, and watching her struggling to see things was something I've never forgotten. I've often wondered what happened to her and I can still picture her now. She had a gorgeous body too (same general shape as yours, Specky-Spice! - despite what women's magazines might say, a girl with a pear-shaped figure in strong glasses is just about the best there is!)    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specky-Spice</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2002, 17:18</p><p>Sarah - your prescription is very like mine! For me contact lenses were a fantastic thing when I was in my teens, and for some purposes they still are. Like I said, most of the time when I was at school I didn't mind wearing my glasses (and a couple of guys I was close to said they really liked me in them which certainly helped) but I was doing quite a lot of things on stage (ballet, singing, acting) and being able to see more than a few inches in front of me was important, but glasses were just not feasible. So after a few years of being almost blind on stage, the contacts were something which did wonders for my self-esteem when I was performing. By the way, I wasn't amazingly good or anything, and I got a bit too big to be a dancer, but quite a few years of ballet classes are one of my favourite memories from childhood and adolescence. As for now, I don't mind glasses at all (especially not the new ones), but being involved in performances are times when I thank God for contact lenses! The rest of this discussion at the moment has a lot to make girls with glasses feel good about themselves in the latest posts: I've got rubbish eyesight and a slightly pearshaped figure, but now I've just been reading all these posts from guys saying your fantasy girl has strong glasses and a curvy bottom. That's cool!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sarah</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2002, 16:03</p><p>Specky-spice, </p><p>   My glasses prescription right now (I found it) is R -11.5 -.75 axis 85, L -11 -.5 axis 110.  My glasses are regular plastic lenses, in oval metal frames that aren't all that small.  I think the frames are fairly nice on their own, but they're just overpowered by the lenses.  i got regular plastic because they're a lot cheaper and I rarely wear my glasses.  The way they look really makes me want to avoid wearing them if possible. </p><p>   I was wondering why you had self-esteem problems (in your teens) because of bad vision and ballet, while you were also wearing contacts.  How did this all play out? </p><p> </p><p>Sarah</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2002, 15:19</p><p>Clare, </p><p>   The most beautiful "sighting" I ever saw was a blond girl with black plastic frames.  The frames were a brilliant contrast to her fair skin and hair.   </p><p>   I really don't think blond hair means that frames should be "lighter" (thinner or smaller or a lighter color).  And a lot of colors that don't do much for dark-haired people do work well on blonds...most non-neutral colors (blue, red, etc) for example. </p><p>   Plastic frames look really good on women regardless of skin tone or hair color, as long as the size, shape and color match the wearer.  But plastic frames are the boldest look, generally.  Metal frames seem to say "try not to notice my glasses, please", whereas plastic frames say, "that's right, I'm wearing glasses."   </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2002, 00:35</p><p>Peter, as a blonde (natural of course!) I've always stayed away from plastic lenses, thinking they would be too 'heavy' a look, so your comments interested me. What colour plastic frames do you think suit blondes?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SZ6</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2002, 20:41</p><p>You know, this is a really, really hard question to answer.  I was thinking at first that, obviously, she would be a full-time GWG with around -20.

She might be about 5'8", in shape but curvy, ample breasts and a butt that looked great in tight jeans...she's probably have auburn hair with brown eyes, maybe freckles, a joyful smile, a really sarcastic streak, a twisted sense of humor, interested in science and technology, with an appreciation--but not an overappreciation--for art, into heavy music, but discerningly so...opinionated but open to debate...bright...sensual...I could go on and on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2002, 17:40</p><p>The glasses are about minus 50, or sometimes lenticulars,but she has no other vision problem, so she can see within the limitation of the lenses. She is hard of hearing but can hear with two hearing aids. One leg is deformed and very short,so she wears a calliper which ends in a built-up shoe like a club foot. Her height can be anything above about 4'10'' and her build can be anything short of grossly obese. I'm not fussy. </p><p>Well, you did say fantasy! </p><p>(Bye the way, is anybody else turned on by the extremely rare sight of a significantly built-up boot or shoe?) </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

In actuality, my dream-babe need not even wear glasses at all- just looking for a girl who is beautiful, intelligent, great sense of humor, sweet personaility, etc.  But, IDEALLY, I seem to have a thing for Irish-looking lasses, redheaded preferably, lots of freckles are a plus, large, natural breasts.  And, of course, she would be a full-time glasses wearer (including in bed!), with glasses in the -10 range (or even higher).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2002, 12:31</p><p>This is a bit of fun we haven't had for a little while so here goes with my fantasy gwg: strong correction for myopia (preferably at least minus 8, twice as much would be nice), somewhere between 5'3" and 5'7", with the sort of slightly full (but not fat) figure that looks sensational in tight jeans. And then there must be the brains. I very strongly agree with Mike and Peter -- extremely clever as well as extremely shortsighted is more or less ideal, and with a career as well as an independent mind. Dim is definitely non-viable. Literate, musical, art-loving, etc. etc. pretty well essential in this fantasy world. Not bothered about sportiness, though it would be a bonus (but a good dancer would be wonderful). As for hair colour etc., mousy or red-head does it for me more than blondes oddly enough. And a girl with a real sense of humour and irony.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mike</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2002, 10:53</p><p>Glasses are very sexy indeed...but what else makes the "ideal" female (or male) for those on this site? I've been lurking for a while and thought I'd ask. My own ideal would be something like this: a girl about 5'4" with quite strong glasses for correcting severe short-sightedness, lots and lots of brains, a nice body (not too thin - particularly not on the thighs and hips) and an amusing personality. What do other people think? I thought about other things that might make a girl even sexier as well as her glasses (hearing aids? partially sighted? a minor speech imediment?) but I think the person I've just described would be more or less perfect. As it is, it's all a fantasy as I'm happily married to a lovely wife who is almost nothing like the woman I've just described. Which only goes to show something or other, but I'll leave the psychologists to work out what it might be! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specky-Spice</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2002, 01:20</p><p>Hi Sarah. I got small black metal oval frames - I hope they look quite chic! For the sunglasses I've got plastic frames which are a bit squarer (and because of the regular plastic lenses, somewhat thicker). I know what you mean about the self-conscious thing, but I have been wearing glasses since I was six, so it's not that big a deal for me. When I was in my teens I used to go through phases of hating my glasses, but enough people told me they were OK that eventually I (just about) believed them, though that was at exactly the same time they were getting stronger and stronger - that was a bad time from the self-esteem point of view as the thing I loved most was ballet, and by the time I was about fifteen I was helpless without my specs (not much good having a specky ballerina on stage!) so then the contacts came in useful. What is your prescription, by the way?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sarah</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2002, 18:26</p><p>Specky-Spice, </p><p>   What kind of frames did you get? I mean, what shape and material, I guess.  I can really relate to what you said a while back about not feeling very glamorous wearing your glasses.  It seems like I see a lot of people who look great in glasses, but I definitely wouldn't say that I'm one of them...but I've never tried that hard to find ones I liked that much, since I hardly ever wear them.  Once I 'noticed' my glasses were really strong, I pretty much gave up on the idea of glasses.  I felt pretty self-conscious -- when I first got them I was anxious because I thought I would get picked on.  And now I feel self-conscious just because they're SO thick.  The first time my roommate saw me wearing them, she was like "whoa, you're really blind, aren't you?"  I said, "no, I mean, I could see a motorhome if it pulled right in front of me, or maybe a jumbo jet." </p><p>   Specky-spice, how old were you when you started wearing glasses?  </p><p> </p><p>Sarah</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specky-Spice</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2002, 14:53</p><p>I got some free prescription sunglasses out of the deal, though with regular lenses in them rather than high-index ones. But the price for the whole lot was pretty reasonable. I was also impressed with the quality of their service and the care they took over checking the lenses etc., and - before that - the extreme care taken over the eye test itself. N.B. I don't work for Boots despite this reading like a commercial for them!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specky-Spice</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2002, 07:39</p><p>I said I'd write again when I had news about the latest glasses. Well, the new high-index glasses which I mentioned a couple of weeks ago have arrived, and I'm wearing them as I type this. The lenses are sooooo much thinner than my previous glasses and I'm really pleased with the way they look (they've also got some sort of coating on them which makes them less prone to reflections - a problem with my old lenses as they had flat front surfaces). The frames are quite small, so the glasses themselves don't look too bad at all. I've been looking at myself in the mirror for a while from every angle and I think I like what I see. The edges are far less thick, the coke-bottle effect is not so pronounced, and I'll be quite happy to be seen by anyone in these specs. Somebody asked about the prescription. I've got a thing from Boots Opticians with the new glasses which says (without the "axis" numbers): Right eye: -11.00, -1.00 Left eye -10.00, -1.75. I like them, but whether they're something other people will find sexy or not, I can't really say yet. I won't be wearing them full time (too many people know me in contacts) but I'll certainly put on my glasses more often than before.</p><p></p><hr>

I don't recall seeing Julie Delpy in anything recently, but a few years ago she appeared on People's 50 most beautiful people list.  In her half-page bio it when on at length about how as a kid or teenager she wore "really thick" glasses all the time even though she didn't need them because she had a facination with an author who wore thick glasses.  She said she wore thick glasses then when she didn't need them, and doesn't like to wear glasses now that she does need them.  Needless to say there were no pictures of her wearing glasses, but a very interesting story.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Socks</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2002, 13:33</p><p>To whomever asked about whether it drives my girlfriend crazy to wear her glasses at the end of her nose all the time, I think she likes to do it.  She has never once complained about them sliding down her nose.  Sometimes they're so low she has to tilt her head back a bit to see through them.  I LOVE that!  If they get too low she just pushes them half way up and then lets them slide right back down.  She seems to enjoy it.  As I've said, her prescription is only -1, so I think she can manage okay looking over them or around them if it's ever necessary. </p><p> </p><p>I wish more girls would realize how many guys there are that like girls who wear glasses.  About a year or so ago there was a little sidebar article in Men's Health magazine where they asked their readers what things a women could wear that turns them on.  The resounding number 1 response was glasses by something like 50% of respondents, followed by some rather unexpected answers like baseball caps, running shoes and then the usual lingerie, high heels and stuff.  No other item was mentioned by more than about 20% of respondents.  More girls would wear their glasses out in the evening if they realized this.  In Whistler, my girlfriend was the only girl in the entire place wearing glasses that night.  Pretty sad.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specky-Spice</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2002, 10:57</p><p>Specs4ever - thanks for that: I think you sum it up very nicely. I do wear my glasses with pleasure (and a bit of pride too - they've been part of my 'look' for years and years), and also contacts when they seem the right thing to wear. As you say, whether I'm wearing glasses or contacts is hardly going to make a difference to whether somebody likes me as a person. I don't know what my glasses prescription is, but I'm sure they'll give me it on a card when I get my new specs (I can't find the old one). These posts have got me thinking more positively about how men might see me when I'm in glasses. That's cool for any specky girl.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pete</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2002, 04:32</p><p>My wife is on medication that makes her UV intollerent and she has a higher chance of developing cataracts, she was advised to wear UV glasses, if she got an RX in them then we were able to claim them on our health insurance, she had an eye test and was +.25 with a -.25 astig and+.50 with a -.25 asig, once she started wearing them she found she liked the correction came to enjoy the fashion part of the glasses, she is now +.50 with a -.25 astig an=.75 with a -.25 astig and a +.75 add in both eyes and wears progressives. So it was not actually poor eyesight that started her wearing glasses but as a preventative measure, and maybe she just wanted to wear glasses but has never admitted that!! and I won't ask I just enjoy!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2002, 18:08</p><p>Your glasses are likely in the range of -12 Specky Spice, as contacts are worn closer to the eye, and in a minus prescription don't have to be as strong as the glasses.  Most girls don't realize that many men find them attractive wearing glasses, but glasses are not all that makes up a good long lasting relationship. For me, glasses might make you more attractive, but if I couldn't stand you as a person, I would be gone in a flash.  So, wear the specs proudly when you want to, and wear contacts when you feel the need.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specky-Spice</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2002, 11:55</p><p>OK Alan, I'm hearing you. I'd like to be memorable too!

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2002, 10:44</p><p>Speckie-spice -- For what it's worth, I once saw a really attractive girl wearing a strong pair of glasses (between -10 and -12, I think) at a Dave and Busters.  (D&amp;B;'s is a combination of a sports bar and video arcade.)  This was a couple years ago.  The glasses were nice, and suited her well.  I can say with complete certainty that I wouldn't remember her if not for the glasses.  Of course, I really like strong glasses; to me they're rare and interesting, and whether they look good or not really tells me what kind of sense of style the wearer has.  Maybe you don't want to be *this* memorable, but I figured I'd share this. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, when you get your new glasses, do tell us what you think of them. </p><p> </p><p>Pete -- I'm curious too; do you know how the medication indicated wearing glasses?

<p><b>Pete</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2002, 08:29</p><p>I have been married to a beautiful girl for 16 years who had 20/20 vision, about 3 years ago she was advised to wear glasses or contacts due to medication she was taking, she always hated the idea of wearing glasses, so I presumed she would opt for contacts. We were shopping one day when she said " I suppose I should do something about this eye thing" as we walked past an optical outlet, so in we went and she started trying on frames, she said, " mm some of these don't look so bad" and after asking which I prefered she chose some brown metal frames, I must say I was in shock and highly delighted, couldn't wait for her to get them, a week later she picked them up and she looked fantastic, she recieved many positive comments from her friends. Well now she wears them all the time 100% She has about 7 different frames  and she co ordinates them with what she wears. I must be the luckiest guy in the world!!.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bergerac</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2002, 08:09</p><p>I don't post much but I have enjoyed reading the posts on eyescene for a number of years.  However, I must share my current state of happiness with you as it is very much glasses related. </p><p> </p><p>About last October I met a fantastic girl who as far as I could tell had 20/20 vision.  We started seeing each other regularly in January.  One day I went to see her at work and discovered that she in fact wore contacts.  I discovered this becasue she'd picked up an eye infection and was sporting a nice pair of black rimmed metal oval specs.  I was already in love with the girl but discovering that she wore glasses was a huge extra bonus because I've always liked girls in specs.  At first I thought she was a fairly low myope because her lenses are really thin with not much cut in.  I didn't say a word but when we were out that evening she told me all about it and asked what I thought of her specs.  IShe told me that her prescription is Right -4.75, -0.50 (axis 15 I think), Left - 6.25, no cylinder.  I was quite shocked and would have to say they are the best made and thinnest pair of hi-index lenses I've ever seen.   </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, I'm pleased to say that the eye infection cleared up quickly but she now wears her specs about 50% of the time at work and when we go out and all the time at home (we now live together).  She knows that I think she looks at least as beautiful with specs as without and today she had a new haircut which was made for a girl with her sort of glasses.  She is a stunner, I'm very lucky and I hope you don't mind me going on about it at such length! </p><p> </p><p>I'm certain that more and more attractive young women with moderate to high prescriptions are choosing to wear specs since hi-index lenses became popular and apart from the convenience I'm sure they realise that an awful lot of men find glasses very attractive indeed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specky-Spice</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2002, 07:24</p><p>Hi Don. You're the kind of guy to give a girl a confidence boost! I sort of hope that men will find me reasonably attractive whether I'm in glasses or in contacts (I mean there's a bit more to it than just the glasses thing). I'm waiting to get a new pair with high index lenses (I've got quite a strong prescription) and if they look as good as the optician says they will, then I'll maybe give them a try when I'm on the town...I wouldn't do it at the moment just because the lenses do get comments sometimes - and that's not really the conversation I want when I'm dancing till I drop. Don't mind it at other times, which is how/why I found this site. But I'm probably more likely to wear my new specs on a special occasion. Keep saying nice things about specky girls, Don!

<p><b>Specky-Spice</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2002, 06:20</p><p>It's nice of you to say that Don! The trouble is that I don't feel particularly glamorous in my glasses (that's not quite the same as whether I feel/look sexy in specs). I like my glasses, I do actually wear them most of the time, but there are some occasions - and going clubbing is one of them - when they just don't seem like the right thing to wear - it's a fashion thing rather than not wanting to be seen to be a glasses-wearer. It's just as well for people like me that men find girls in glasses attractive - that's how they see me for about 90 per cent of the time. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specky-Spice</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2002, 01:47</p><p>GwGs: as a girl, I have to tell you that it doesn't feel strange to put in contacts for a night out. With disposable contacts so easy to wear (and available for quite strong prescriptions) it's all just part of getting glammed-up. I like my glasses, but I don't wear them if I'm going clubbing, any more than I wear my favourite pair of jeans. Bare-eyed is not an option for me since I'm very short-sighted, but thanks to 1-day Accuvue contacts, that's no problem (they make them up to -12, which is very good news for people with dodgy eyesight like mine; my contacts are -10.00 at the moment). Take care. </p><p></p><hr>

During the daytime, I see quite a few gals wearing their glasses, but at night, there aren't as many.  I guess quite a few of them switch to contacts or go "bare-eyed".

We were in Whistler (very trendy ski resort / outdoor sports type town north of Vancouver) for 3 days.  Walking through Whistler village in the afternoon with my girlfriend and her glasses at the end of her nose, t-shirt, short denim shorts, white knee socks, light blue suede Vans.  She drew a lot of attention, mostly because of the socks, because tons of people wearing glasses but the knee socks are a little more rare. Later that night she wears a black mini skirt, black shirt, white knee socks, black platform loafers, and again glasses at the end of her nose.  Still draws a ton of attention but what I notice is the same trendy people who wear their glasses all day don't seem to at night.  Almost no GWG's after dark.

<p><b>Socks</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2002, 00:32</p><p>I told my girlfriend (of 2 years) the morning after the first night she slept over about my two fetishes, one of which is glasses.  She didn't even wear glasses at the time.  She told me that she had gotten a prescription about 9 months earlier (before we had met), but never got glasses.  She was very excited to get glasses and participate in this fetish with me.  She nows wears her -1's full time when she's with me, including making love, and I'm guessing about 75% when I'm not around.  We have had a few less than pleasant discussions when she begins to feel that her glasses are more important to me than she is, but I think she's generally very secure about how I feel about her and her glasses as I am very conscious to constantly make sure that she understands how strongly I feel about her. She even wears them down at the end of her nose almost full time now because she knows that I like it.  It's very cool when she does this in front of her parents, sister and friends who for so many years never saw her wear glasses at all, then start to, then wear them at the end of her nose.  A little off topic, but my other fetish is white knee socks.  She's been equally good about that.  Imagine how turned on I get when she wears white knee socks all the time in front of those very same people whom she never had worn them in front of before, or at least not since she was about 13. </p><p> </p><p>She is great and I treat her like a Queen.  It is indeed a fine line, but I was open from the beginning and I am glad that I was.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sandy</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2002, 22:32</p><p>Rimshot and Hearty, thanks for the kind words.  This whole situation is a major heartache for me, but I'm a firm believer that tomorrow will be a better day.  Take care for now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sandy</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2002, 22:38</p><p>Rimshot, he would always want me to wear my specs while we had sex.  He would always enjoy playing with my glasses and messing the the lenses  up.  Also, he enjoyed wearing my spare glasses around the house.  Sometimes I wondered how he saw out of the glasses because of the astigmatism.  The last straw was when he was having an affair while I was away, he had his girlfriend, wear my spare glasses while they were sleeping around.  I didn't catch him in the act, but I had my doubts because of the strange makeup left on the frames.  Anyway, after a while, it got very old.  Take care. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hearty</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2002, 21:13</p><p>Doc Bob, sometimes I want that and then....does not a part of the delicious intensity come from some secretiveness? I am torn on this issue... I told my last (THEE last) boyfriend a large part of my attraction, little by little, but I never did divulge all the many ways in which it turned me on. I didn't want him to know I was secretly peering through his lenses while he worked at a task, or how much I loved that vulnerability....he always wanted to be so strong (and is) I mean I share with some, like my family, that I am attracted to glasses, but I can't reveal the entire sexual experience of it. OO bars though....could be interesting....  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rimshot</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2002, 21:37</p><p>Sandy, </p><p> </p><p>Yes, I had my reasons for not disclosing my fetish to her.  One major reason, which I think youre pointing out, was that I couldnt rationalize finding pleasure in the object she loathed.  After all it was her discomfort not mine.  Furthermore, I didnt want her to think for a moment that I wasn't there for her unconditionally.  With that said, there were moments I walked a very fine line.   </p><p> </p><p>May I make a correction?  A fetish is not a fantasy.  A fetish is a clear and distinct object of awe whereas a fantasy is a flight of the imagination.  Maybe theres a common psychological  root but I cant think that hard right now.  Besides, this may not be the appropriate thread. </p><p> </p><p>Can wearing glasses make you feel sexy or did your ex ruin that for you? </p><p> </p><p>Bye for now. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2002, 16:56</p><p>London's hottest new extravaganza, the Bollywood epic 'Bombay Dreams' opened in the West End last night. Interesting to see that one of the male leads wears glasses throughout, the male star wears them in some scenes and at one point three intended Indian cuties are also wearing them. I wonder if it might start a trend.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sandy</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2002, 13:18</p><p>Rimshot, perhaps you should have told her early on about your fantasies, but you never know what her reaction would have been.  To most gals, strong glasses are more of a problem, then a blessing. If she wanted to go bare-eyed, that would be a problem because everything would be blurry.  Also, you would have to worry about thick lenses. In the past, I enjoyed wearing large plastic frame glasses, but they went out of style.  My current pair is a smaller brown plastic frame pair.  At least, I don't have to worry about the edge thickness that much. I know that there are people out there that like to see girls wearing thick glasses, but I like my lenses thinner.   Take care for now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Boscoe</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2002, 10:53</p><p>I agree. My last two mates wore glasses full time. And the glasses were not the reason I was with them. Glasses definitely did enhance the relationship though</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rimshot</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2002, 10:38</p><p>Sandy, </p><p> </p><p>I must confess . . . I loved it when my wife wore her strong glasses .  .  . But thats not why I married her.    </p><p> </p><p>It would be flippant of me to say I prefer glasses the way some prefer blondes.  A fetish runs deep in the psyche.  I've nurtured mine over the years, too.  Nothing gives it more life than having a bespectacled partner.  Perhaps I should have shared this with her early on.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GWG'sRule!</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2002, 01:19</p><p>Sandy, oddly enough, if I am dancing with a girl with glasses, I would prefer for her to leave them on!  That especially holds true during private dances at "gentleman's clubs" although generally the GWG's there leave them on without comment from me!   (What's interesting is at strip clubs the GWG's, not that there are many of them (GWG's, that is), unfortunately), generally seem to get a LOT of attention from the clientele, and not just me!). </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sandy</b>&nbsp;31 May 2002, 18:59</p><p>Rimshot, I just went thru a marriage where my husband was like that.  It got old after awhile, not to mention that he was cheating on me while I was having personal problems.  Somedays, I wondered if he was in love with my specs instead of me.   </p><p>Doctor Bob, I usually will leave my specs on because I would like to be able to see when I'm out there dancing.  I have had a few guys insist that I take them off after awhile.  It wouldn't bother me if someone found my glasses to be erotic.  My current man doesn't mind me in my glasses, he thinks that I look cute in them.  Take care.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dr Bob</b>&nbsp;31 May 2002, 11:20</p><p>Sandy - how do dance partners react when you put on your specs? Would it upset you if they found you madly erotic when you put your specs on?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rimshot</b>&nbsp;30 May 2002, 22:29</p><p>Sandy et al, </p><p> </p><p>How's it when a guy comes on to you diggin your glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sandy</b>&nbsp;30 May 2002, 20:55</p><p>Lore, you are right.  My prescription is -3.75 and -4.00 and I wouldn't go out without any correction. I don't like hassling with contacts, so glasses are my only option.  When I go out to the club to go dancing or out to the casino bar drinking, I will leave my specs on so that I can scope out the scenery.  What I noticed around the clubs are that most gals leave their glasses on while they are surveying the situation and the glasses come right off when they run into the opposite sex.  It's a pity because most look kind of cute wearing their glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;30 May 2002, 16:41</p><p>Doctor Bob, </p><p> </p><p>I can't imagine any high myope (and I'm pretty close) going without any correction for any period of time.  It is simply too hard to get around.  Lots of people wear contacts, but I can't imagine that anyone who was very nearsighted would attempt to go to a nightclub and not wear any correction.  I mean, if the whole point of looking cute is to attract a cute guy, you want to know what they look like, right? </p><p> </p><p>My personal opinion is that most people with an Rx above -4.00 rarely take off their glasses when meeting someone, and that barely anyone around -6.00 or over would take them off for anything other than sleeping, showering, and possibly reading.  Contacts is a different story, and I know a lot of people who will wear contacts when they go out to a club, but I don't know anyone who is very nearsighted who would go without glasses OR contacts for a night out.  Totally impractical.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alissa</b>&nbsp;30 May 2002, 14:38</p><p>I really never wore them when I went out, but always wore contacts, cause I hate not being able to see. </p><p>Go fig. </p><p>Alissa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doctor Bob</b>&nbsp;30 May 2002, 11:23</p><p>Just a thought - would high myope GWG try not to wear their specs at a nightclub when hoping to pull a man? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alissa</b>&nbsp;28 May 2002, 14:33</p><p>Two boyfriend's ago, I was wearing contacts almost full time and was dating a person who I swear was a gwg lover. It wasn't until our tenth date that he found out I was a glasses wearer and the romance peaked a bit. So, I'd have to say it would depend on the person. Glasses just adds to something already beautiful. </p><p>Alissa </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180717081313/http://texasdigital.com/alissa/cuteinglasses/" target="_blank">http://texasdigital.com/alissa/cuteinglasses/</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eddy</b>&nbsp;17 May 2002, 14:35</p><p>Bangkok is indeed excellent and a lot cheaper than HK. Also Manila. Also just about anywhere in China. They're usually called Da Ming meaning Great Clarity, a wonderful name for an optical shop. It's not so common any more but they used to get people to try out their prescription by having them walk around the street in front of the shop with their test frames and lenses on; you know, the frames that they slip the lenses in during the test. I used to find the sight of twenty or thirty women wandering around the street looking like something out of "The Fly" strangely........ erotic.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jay</b>&nbsp;17 May 2002, 02:34</p><p>I've been looking in on eye scene for several weeks since i came back from Thailand and i dont think anything compares to Bangkok. You can just show them a piece of paper with any prescripton and they will do it for you some examples i got were -13 +7,  in one frame and they will give you a form with the prescription on if you ask. You can also get contacts just the same way. They will do most things in less than a few days. I have some great goc and i also got some good strong prescription glasses in the uk by just taking my "official "  prescription to a uk optician  and asking could they make me up some glasses to it.( this can work out cheap also if you shop around)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eddy</b>&nbsp;16 May 2002, 23:48</p><p>Portia, you're singing my song. To answer your questions seriatim: </p><p>a) September October November and possibly December is the only nice time of the year in HK. Temperatures in the 80s day and high 70s night, lower humidity. Right now it sucks bigtime (hot humid and drizzly). First typhoon in June signals hot (90s day, high 80s night) and truly amazingly humid (80% relative) but with a fair amount of sun between the torrential downpours. </p><p>b) You can write your own rx on any dirty piece of paper you like and, as long as you are prepared to enter into an exchange of valuable consideration, they'll make them up for you. Money talks in HK. With due deference to our friends in the Other Place, let me repeat the old maxim that a HK queer is someone who thinks that women are more important than money. </p><p>c) Similarly with contacts. This is GOC paradise. </p><p>d) Cost of an average made-up pair with progressive lenses is aboutUS$ 300 - 400 </p><p>e) As you would imagine in a very rich city where 70% of people are myopic (average -7!! Really!) there's a full range of whatever you can get anywhere in the world. </p><p>f) Of course credit cards, cash, electronic funds transfer, whatever you like as long as it's money-related. Barter is discouraged I supposed but people will always cut a deal. </p><p>g) and of course, with all of the above, how could it be anything but the best fun you can have standing up.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2002, 13:38</p><p>Yes glasses are very sexy indeed. I've just spent the past month observing the most gorgeous 'señoritas con gafas' and I'm still recovering from walking into lamp posts! There were also lots of German tourists wearing bizarre frames that seemed to be made up of bits of scrap metal welded together at odd angles. Getting into a clinch with one of these girls could result in some nasty lacerations to the face! Most memorable moment was high on a mountain in the middle of nowhere, coming across a very pleasant English GWG who just happened to be going in the same direction as me for the next 20 minutes.</p><p></p><hr>

Mr. High Myope needs new glasses and ignores it every day by pulling them forward in an attempt to see nearby items. He has an add built into his current glasses, but it is no longer enough to do the job. In years past, he could get by buying glasses every 20 years or so, but now, when presbyopia rears its ugly head, new Rx happen more often.  </p><p> </p><p>How does one convince a partner that it is time for an new Rx?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2002, 14:37</p><p>I just saw the new Lenscrafters commercial.  I loved it!!  It shows multiple people in different frames.  The voiceover talks about how fashionable glases are.  Then it ends with the question:  Are you lucky enough to need glasses?  I know they are just trying to sell a product, but this commercial speaks directly to us!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>spexalot</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2002, 10:45</p><p>I think the styles of today's glasses are modern and sexy. I never much cared for the 1980's "upside down" look which with glass or CR-39 lenses weighed a ton. No wonder the switch to contacts. My favorite glasses on a GWG are small black plastic ovals or semi ovals. On some TV commericals you see women wearing them. To spot high index lenses just notice the number of power rings and facial indention with minus lenses. I also like seeing GWGs in strong glasses with an AR coating. At times her glasses look like they have no lenses in them but you just know that without them on she is a like a bat. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2002, 07:50</p><p>I have to agree Dockman that the glasses of the 90's dont look as great to me as the new hi index ones do.  But, I have spotted an increasing number of people that are willing to wear glasses, now that they feel that their lenses are not so thick.  And, to me that is a nice trade off.  I get a real kick out of scoping a fine looking GWG out, and noticing that her prescription is a -10 at the very least.  I know she wouldn't have been caught dead in public wearing a -10 in CR39 in a 54 eye sized frame from the late 80's, so I consider that a nice spotting.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dockman</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2002, 07:22</p><p>The oversize plastic frames from a few years ago were definitely sexy. I can remember another wearer of plastic frames who worked in the lab at the hospital I worked at. She used a microscope and as a result, she removed her glasses every time she looked through the microscope. She was myopic, although I don't know how much.The thin lenses of today can't equal the way those thick lenses looked back then. Especially when those lenses were encased in those nice thick plastic frames.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GwGLover</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2002, 01:56</p><p>I had the eye test, it's not what i expected though. In short it's only -0.5 in my right eye. Do you think I should get it corrected or not? The optician thinks there is no need!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>HalimM</b>&nbsp;05 Jan 2002, 15:50</p><p>&lt;b&gt;Hi all,&lt;\b&gt; </p><p>this is my first post to ES BBS, I've found it few days and I was surprised how many people is interested in wide range of optic and glasses topics. Let me join this gorgous communitty : ) </p><p>I'am 25 years old male phD student at University and all my world turns about glasses. </p><p>&lt;b&gt;At first&lt;\b&gt;, I wear specs myself down to shortsightness.I was told to have vision problems when I was 10 and I couldn't read clearly the blackboard at school in all cases.Parents took me to eye doc and I was prescribed first specs -1.0D.I was so excited and frightned and I resist wearing glasses becouse of other kids reactions.I used to wear it only for lessons. When I grew up I understood matter of myopia and I stopped take care about other oppinions. Step by step I was impressed by those pices of glass that made my world clear and sharp.When I was 15 I became full time wearer with -2,5D, I realized to myself that I like watching other people with glasses.It was great time because I noticed that my younger sister (she was 10) also had vision problems.Once when I came back from school I saw her sitting very close to TV set and watching some movie.I knew what was going on and I gave her my old specs.She could see better. As you can imagine I told about it to my mom and, three days gone and my little sister appear to me wearing beautifull -2.0 glasses.she adjusted it quickly and wore all yhe time from the beginning.We used to talk about our specs and try it each other time to time, but I've never reveald my fascination about vision.Years went and our eyes have worsened sistematicall, we went to eye doc together usually and I put down all the moments. So our story was : </p><p>Age(Me,Lena)			Me			Lena </p><p>10,5			-1,00L;-1.00R			------ </p><p>13,8			-1,75L;-1,50R			------ </p><p>15,10			-2,50L;-2,25R		  -2,00L;-2,00R	 </p><p>16,11			-3,50L;-3,25R		  -2,25L;-2,00R </p><p>17,12			-3,75L;-3,25R		  -3,75L;-3,50R </p><p>18,13			-3,75L;-3,25R		  -4,50L;-4,25R </p><p>19,14			-3,75L;-3,50R		  -5,25L;-5,00R </p><p>20,15			-4,00L;-3,50R		  -6,00L;-5,50R </p><p>My myopia stoped then, and this is my current one </p><p>   16						  -6,50L;-6,25R </p><p>   17        					  -7,00L;-6,75R </p><p>And when I was 22 I left my parents home so I stoped to collect detailed data, but Lena's myopia stopped about her 20 with about -8 lenses. </p><p>It was really amazing to grew up and watch how her prescription change. </p><p>&lt;b&gt;Second:&lt;\b&gt;I am totally crazy about girls with glasses, to be honest I am hundred percent glasses fetishist : ) </p><p>There is nothing more sexy and attractive then preety, sensual girl with minus lenses.I love watching women touch glasses, put it better on nose if sllip down, clean lenses.Women can do it on very sensual and sexy way.well choosen specs make woman so hot, and eyes covered begind minus lenses are so mysterious.DELICIOUS :) </p><p>My favorites are: long black hair, brown eyes, metal frames choosen according to face and normal minus lenses from -3 to -10. I could jump into fire for that girl :) </p><p>So, it is a bit long as first post and I don't wont to be boring. </p><p>Apologize for all mistakes, but englids id not my first language( but I'am still working to make it more fluent and I hope to express all what I fell soon) </p><p>&lt;b&gt;BEST WISHES&lt;\b&gt; 	</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dockman</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2001, 09:49</p><p>I just remembered another sexy remembrance from a hospital I once was employed at. There was a girl who was a ward clerk who had the most enormous plastic framed glasses on that I ever saw. They were tremendously over sized for her  petite face. They looked good on her and she was constantly pushing them up her nose. This was back in 1989 and I haven't seen anyone with glasses like that since.They were definitely eye-candy and it was always a pleasure to go up to that floor to do my duties. That girl and the other hot glasses wearing girls really made my housekeeping job bearable.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>boringeyes</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2001, 13:05</p><p>For those of you who feel like there is something "wrong" with you for liking girls with glasses, as somebody who is NOT into it, I have to say I don't see the problem with it.  Most glasses these days are very flattering.  I don't see how any thinking person could find it any more perverse than preferring a certain body type or hair color, etc.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Don</b>&nbsp;24 Dec 2001, 05:06</p><p>I guess I'll share my story as well. Like most of you, I am attracted to women with glasses, especially minus powers. </p><p> </p><p>Having worn a decently high power for  many years (combined R -8.50, L -9.50), I always dated girls with glasses. As a myopic kid with thick glasses, it always seemed that I would pick out the girl in the class who wore glasses, and then date her.  Finally married a high myope (her power even higher than mine). </p><p> </p><p>In the last couple of years, the trend  has been smaller frames with high-index or polycarbonate lenses, as well as Lasik and contacts, of course. </p><p> </p><p>This has made it more infrequent to spot those with truly high powers, as they are not as obvious. </p><p> </p><p>I continue to wear a regular plastic CR39 lens (lined trifocals, too) with a wire frame with 54 eye size. My lenses  may be at least 8mm or 9mm thick. </p><p> </p><p>   </p><p>Today, I enjoy wearing  glasses even more than ever. I truly believe that my glasses are my distinguishing characteristic, and I'm blessed to have a high power and actually live my fetish for glasses. </p><p> </p><p>My wife doesn't have a glasses fetish, but it's no secret that her glasses were one of my attractions to her, and we've been married 14 years. Fortunately, she has stayed with her thick glasses exclusively, too. </p><p> </p><p>Would appreciate your feedback.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2001, 05:11</p><p>Bobby, sorry things didn't work out the first time you tried.  Wish you the best with your new GF man. </p><p> </p><p>Personally, GWG loving [as LikeGlass would put it :)] is a part of me, part of who I am, my personality...It's as inseparable as my head.  I mean sure, you could decapitate me.  Shit, I wouldn't be myself after that would I?  It's the same with GWG loving.  I could deny it, suppress it, just keep it to myself.  But for what?  I'd be a shell of the man I am...I wouldn't be myself.  I wouldn't be me. </p><p> </p><p>It's only fair that I let any future GF know this first and foremost.  If she wants to be with me, she's just going to have to understand it, and live with it.  If it's going to be a problem, then things just aren't going to work out.  You just can't keep stuff like that secret, especially when you're so intimate with someone...you do that, and you're pretty much lying to that person every time you're with her. </p><p> </p><p>If things are going to work out, she's gotta like me for me - in my entirety.  People get this misconception that "Oh, it's OK, I'll change him."  Bullshit!!  Nobody can change me except me. </p><p> </p><p>That's kinda my policy.

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2001, 20:48</p><p>I would love to shout my obsession from the rooftops but my instinct has always been not to.  I've always thought nobody would understand, and from Bobby's experience (sorry for you man) it was probably right to stay silent.  I agree with Christy insofar as it would be nice to be able to play fair - but I think it would have to be early on, and if the relationship were to continue - great! </p><p> </p><p>As an aside,  I've been caught "staring" at GWG's enough times that I'm sure some of them must suspect.  How about it girls with glasses?  Can you tell when somebody you meet is obsessed with your specs?     </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2001, 14:13</p><p>Bobby - if you always play fair - I think things will work out best for you. You have my best wishes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2001, 14:11</p><p>1. Sorry for the typos in the previous post.  </p><p>2. I thought my GF might understand because I found her over Internet. My advert read: "Slim, crazy man wearing glasses seeks a nice specsgirl." </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2001, 14:07</p><p>As you know I confessed I like GWGs to my wife many years ago. You also probably know I told my wife in summer I had GOC. </p><p>Now I know I it was a mistake. My marriage is broken. We split in fact although we still live in the same house. Now my wife knows too much about me. </p><p>I may have made the same mistake once more:  </p><p>I told my new GF about my attraction and about GOC. I wanted to give her the possibility to end our relationship if it was a problem for her. </p><p>I could not help myself but telling her, becuase I prefer fair play.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dockman</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2001, 11:30</p><p>The number of GWGs who visit this site is only a minute fraction of all the GWGs worldwide. Just to think about all the girls who are probably wearing glasses and thinking they are the most unattractive females on the planet when in reality they are worshipped by the majority of the males here is amazing. There are tons of girls with that opinion; that they are unappealing with their glasses on. They have no idea that guys like us are out there. Gwg's make the world go round. I'd rather be married to a beautiful girl with glasses than to anyone that we see on our TV screen. I had to get that off my chest, I think GWG's are the coolest.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dockman</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2001, 09:44</p><p>At times, I wish I had never confessed my feelings about glasses and myopia to my wife. The pressure was enormous; I finally had to tell her how intense the attraction was to me. The difference now is that she knows I find her dependence very stimulating and she knows I like seeing her straining to see. Therefore, she rarely allows me the pleasure of gazing upon her bare-eyedness. She has remarked how she doesn't want to talk about her glasses. Obviously she does not find her need for glasses to be very interesting. Now, she can read me like a book. If anyone is into watching figure skating, there is a girl from Russia, Maria Buturskya, who used to have quite a problem seeing her scores after competition. I always tried to watch . Last Sunday, I heard that Maria was skating, in fact my wife told me, so I came to the television to watch, and my wife said," You're just trying to see if Maria squints" Absolutely correct, I thought to myself. The last few competitions have revealed that either Maria has contacts or she has had Lasik. It's great fun being married to a myopic wife, but now it's like she can read my mind.</p><p></p><hr>

My mother is first started wearing hers after her job became mostly computor based, she was shortsighted in one eye and longsighted in the other and also had a bi-focal element built into her lens somewhere as well, my Father was far-sighted and also diabetic which I think contributed to some of his eye problems...</p><p></p><hr>

Anyway - I remember him saying that he might have to wear glasses - and I thought this was so funny that I burst out laughing and said he'd look like Billy Bunter (a one-time popular fat and four-eyed cartoon character). It went down like a lead balloon! Anyway, my dad didn't get glasses and I only noticed he had a pair of readers on my most recent visit. My mum got readers about 10 years ago and I remember her making some comment about not being able to see without her glasses - but I couldn't help noticing that her distance vision was pin-sharp without glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

He has no idea and I don't know if there would be any way I could find out from his optician? He always had astigmatism and said he could see fine, he just wore them for eye strain because he got headches. After I began dating him, two years ago, and after assuring him he looked sexy in them, he started wearing them more, but still not in say, a club, party, or while drumming.  </p><p>Soon he'd come over, wearing them in his shirt or on his head, it was like he was starting to keep them close to him...oh and once, ooh lala, he had to help me with my laptop, and he said he could hardly see the text without his glasses. Well anyway, I finally talked him into getting a more updated pair, we went together to pick them out, which was a highlight of my life! (the only way I would have missed his dr appt. was, I had surgery that day!)When I asked him if his rx was different, he said that he was having a bit of trouble close-up, so they 'gave him something to help that' and he said for distance, one of his eyes had to work a bit harder than before.  </p><p>You know, they must have changed it somewhat, because there was much looking over them and then through, comparing his vision, and he'd take them off, often, only to put them right back on again. Oh gosh, that transition was soooo incredibly intense for me, yet I held it all in, kept my feelings to myself, because I didnt want him to feel inhibited about them. </p><p>And now, well they go on as soon as he rises, he makes his morning coffee in them, and he only takes them off to go to sleep. Sorry, this is a lot more than merely telling his rx, but I love writing about it...Oh and I just cant tell anything about the rx from wearing them, things just look very screwed up, kind of smeary.... </p><p>Hearty</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2001, 10:04</p><p>Julian:  I am very susceptible to motion sickness.  I found that when I first starting wearing GOC, I was plagued by a queasiness that went away as the day wore on.  I don't know if it was the new glasses (I went from -.25 to -6,) or if it was the combo of glasses and contacts.  I did find that for a few days, I took Dramamine tablets in the morning.  This stopped the feeling of being seasick.  After those first few days, I quit taking the pills and I have had no problems.  This might work for your friend.  Has he just gotten these glasses?  Perhaps he just needs that adjustment period, and the Dramamine might help.  Also, if he is opposed to drugs, he might chew on ginger root or candied ginger.  This is a well-known natural remedy for motion sickness.  </p><p></p><hr>
