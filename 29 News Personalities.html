<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;19 Jul 2018, 07:32</p><p>glassesforeveryone </p><p>Thank you for the update. That really explains everything. I tuned in this morning at 7;15AM and she wasn't on. I'm not sure if she was on in the 6 AM time slot or not.  </p><p>I would guess having having a corneal ulcer it will be sometime before she can return to wearing contacts if ever. I believe corneal ulcers usually occurs with contact lens wearers. After this even if she allowed to wear contacts again I wonder if she might be afraid to wear contacts anymore. Time will tell as she recovers if she will go to full time glasses wear or not. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2018, 15:54</p><p>She made me jack off so much that I nearly blew my mind.  I sprayed cum all over the television set and had to wipe it off for hours.  Somehow I even sprayed cum into my speakers.  Robin Meade really cranks my old ass juices up.  I can't wait until tomorrow.  Now where did I put that money I saved for extra Depends?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2018, 14:45</p><p>yesterday morning I happened to be awake in time to watch the early part of "Morning Express with Robin Meade" It was good to see her wearing a really cute little pair of rimless glasses. But before her show was over she was replaced by another reporter for the remainder of her show. Robin made some comment about her eyes getting better.  Does anyone have any idea what she was referring to? I can only assume that she may have had some kind of issue with her contacts which was preventing her from wearing contacts? I didn't wake up early enough today, so by the time I turned it on the same young lady had replaced her again so I can only assume that Robin was again wearing glasses. Most likely she will continue wearing glasses at least through Friday? I may set my alarm so I can see if she is wearing glasses Thursday morning. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glass Lenses</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2018, 22:09</p><p>lonny </p><p>Because most of you people in Europe are socialist, you do not understand America, its governmental system, or the mindset of the American patriot. We do not consider Americans  that promote socialism as patriots. </p><p>It was the American patriots that elected Trump, and we feel very pleased that he is carrying out the promises that we elected him to do. We call this the will of the people. </p><p>Americans have for many years had the highest standard of living in the world, but were slowly losing it, the due to socialism, and globalism. </p><p>In America almost everyone OWNS their own home, often with a fair amount of acreage of land, and usually both adult members own a car each. At age 16 most children get their own car, so many times there are four or more cars in each home. </p><p>We saw this being threatened, and hence the election of Trump. </p><p>Previous Presidents have given vast amounts of our money, and resources, away to foreign countries. This is ending under Trump, not because he wants to do it, but that " we the people want it done. That is the way our system is supposed to be. </p><p>If you Europeans, or others want foreign aid, go find some other nation that will give it to you. And if you want our military to help you, you are very soon going to have to pay us for that. You have milked America for too many years, through NATO, and The United Nations. That is ending also because "we the people" demand it. </p><p>This is what we mean when we say "America First, and MAGA". </p><p>And if you do not like this, so be it, because we the people want America first.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2018, 05:57</p><p>After a week of resting her eyes (from a corneal ulcer), Robin Meade returned to her anchor gig this week.  She's worn her glasses every day--not unexpectedly.  Wonder if it is a temporary or now permanent necessity for her eyes (no more contacts)? </p><p>The first two days she wore her "old" glasses, but these past couple of days she's worn a nearly rimless (and much more subtle) frame.  Again, wondering what the future will bring? She is very attractive and while I do prefer the dark plastic frames, the variety is nice--and always provocative. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

As minutes are counted down to the start of the show everyday, one of their anchors/staff/reporters posts a "behind-the-scenes" FBk Live video.  Often it is Ginger Zee and she wears her glasses--which she has put away by the time she's on the air. </p><p>Today, it was Adrienne Bankert who made the video. She appears at first wearing glasses and explains that that is both rare and a result of forgetting to put in her contacts. Then, in the course of the 6 or 8 minute video, she puts in her contacts and readies for her on the air reporting.</p><p></p><hr>

It's all about optics with this idiot, and any time he can distract from the investigation is a win for him, he thinks.  Plus, praising and going on and on with compliments with a dictator who treats his people like slaves, and has killed AT LEAST his uncle and brother is a disgrace.  Can you imagine how the Warmbier family, (who's son was beaten and tortured into a coma) felt to see this appalling behavior,..Trump is pure evil, and has no right being president.  He only was able to win by making up hundreds of lies about Hillary, and convincing his uninformed, gullible followers that they were true.  It's the same thing he has always done with his businesses.  He is the dirtiest, lying con man in the business world, but most laymen who've never had to deal with him don't know this,..he IS the new mafia.        </p><p></p><hr>

History teaches that dictators do not wear glasses as this would make them appear weak.  I guess orange skin, strange hair and long, long times do not fit into the equation.</p><p></p><hr>

Meanwhile, Alisyn Camerata went the other way as she is now wearing a much more subtle frame style, looks to still be plastic but almost as thin as wire rims. Different styles for different folks--likely why most eyewear stores/offices have racks and racks and racks of choices.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2018, 11:06</p><p>About 2 weeks ago the female co-anchor of our morning CBS station KMOV-TV has been wearing glasses for the first time. I even checked her past bio and before now she has never been seen wearing glasses. her name is Marissa Hollowed. So since she never said anything about why she is now wearing glasses I don't know if she normally wears contacts and maybe had an issue with her contacts or if she recently got an increase causing her to need glasses to see the prompter or if she maybe only recently was prescribed glasses. Her glasses don't appear to be even have a slight cut-in so they must be rather weak. </p><p>Anyway just curious how many other cities have young women anchors wearing glasses these days. It seems like the female national news anchors are being seen wearing their glasses more and more often. So if your city or town has attractive young women anchors wearing glasses please post the city, the station and the time she is on air.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>to city 72</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2018, 05:09</p><p>Soundmanpt, Thanks for your posting regarding TMZ about the pretty blonde lady in the aviator glasses.  I noticed right away the glasses were likely a prescription as I noticed a significant bend in the images through the lenses.  You are probably right that it is a minus prescription.  And yes, after watching several episodes now, I do see her contributing more on the show (but perhaps a lot of these people also contribute behind the scenes and off camera as well).  But what surprises me is my difficulties finding out her name, especially when someone is at "celebrity" status, so to speak.  In this day of Internet and information, I seem to be coming up blank on my Google searches in terms of making a positive identification on her name.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2018, 10:47</p><p>rkcity </p><p>I have been watching TMZ for several years now they have always had several young attractive glasses wearing young ladies on their. I know exactly the young lady you're asking about. When she first joined the newsroom she wasn't wearing glasses at all. Then one night I was pleasantly surprised to see here wearing glasses for the first time. For a while after that it was kind of hit ad miss. Some nights she wore her glasses and some nights she didn't. At first because they are so big I thought her glasses were fake but she does contribute to the show and her glasses definitely are prescription. They appear to minimize things so i'm guessing that she is nearsighted. More recently she is mostly seen wearing her glasses. But occasionally you will see her without her glasses. I would also love to know more about her.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b> rkcity 72</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2018, 05:38</p><p>I have never really watched TMZ When It's On before, but I am now tuning in more since I accidentally noticed the blonde haired woman on the newsroom cast with the clear aviator glasses (she often has been on the lower right hand of the screen.  Also see www.TMZ.com/videos/0_71dt6bww/ Hopefully I got the link right.)   To me, about the hottest sighting is a pretty woman in aviator glasses, especially a blonde.  I am also seeing some of the other female cast members in aviators on some show as well.  Anyway, does anyone know the blonde lady's name?  I would like to Google search more photos of her.  She hasn't seemed to really say anything on the show on the episodes I've seen, but she is the reason I watch TMZ's 1/2 hour format.</p><p></p><hr>

They are quite similar to her previous plastic frames but look to be metal and have almost a modified semi-rimless look.  She had them off and on on Tuesday, another day she was holding them in her hand, and a couple of days they were nowhere in evidence. The eagle-eyed capper/poster on tvnewcaps spotted the new frames.</p><p></p><hr>

Meanwhile Erica Hill is wearing her glasses somewhat more regularly on her HLN midday news show but either wears them or not the whole day. And Robin Meade is all over in her wearing patterns. Sometimes she wears them not at all, lately she's often worn them for a few minutes in segments of the show that recur every 30 or 60 minutes, and on Friday she wore them for much, but not all, of the show. But Robin wears her original pair of spex rather than any of the several newer frames she's shown over the months on FBk.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2018, 09:40</p><p>Well it seems that Paula Faris isn't wearing wearing her glasses anymore on air. In fact today her glasses were nowhere in sight. So it mkaes me wonder if she has switched to wearing contacts and if it was her decision or the station that has her no longer wearing glasses? She didn't seem to mind wearing glasses when she first went on air wearing them. It really makes me think that someone had talk with her about her glasses.  </p><p>Is their anyway to send her an e-mail? Maybe if enough of us sent her e-mails telling her how nice she looked wearing glasses she might be back wearing them.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2018, 12:07</p><p>I woke up enough this morning to turn on Good Morning America and sadly Paula Faris wasn't wearing her glasses again. She has then right in front of her at first but it seemed like after every commercial break her glasses were in a different spot when they came back on. So she must put them on to see something during the breaks and takes them off right before they go live again. Some one at the show must be making her reading material in larger print so she is able to read it without her glasses. Since she first started wearing her glasses on air as her eyes should have continues adjusting to her glasses the more she wore them. in other words she should be needing her glasses more now than when she first started wearing them because her eyes should much more adjusted to them. But she seems like she now needs them less than before and the only way that could happen is if her reading material is in larger print now. She keeps her glasses close by in case maybe something is handed to her that might be breaking news that just came in an no one was able to retype it in a larger font for her. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2018, 09:00</p><p>I overslept on Saturday so I completely missed Good Morning America. I did wake up slightly before it came on Sunday and was a bit disappointed that Paula Faris wasn't wearing her glasses. She of course did have then on the desk in front of her right hand. I noticed when they came back from a commercial break that she was just putting her glasses down. So I assume she must have had them on while they were away but quickly took them off as the were coming back on. So I wonder why she wears her glasses most times when she is on the air but every once in a while she leaves them off? I'm assuming that her prescription must be pretty weak if she is still able to read small print without her glasses. Or is it possible that she maybe gets her script printed in large enough letters that she can get by without her glasses? But when it copy is in normal size print she needs her glasses to see it? I guess we will never know?   </p><p></p><hr>

But even then she had her glasses in her hair on top of head so they would handy if she needed them.  </p><p>Interesting that ever since she started wearing glasses on air they never show a close up of her anymore. In the past before she ware glasses they would often do a close when either of the anchors was doing a report. Not the camera just stay showing both of them.  </p><p>Also in past weeks right after she started wearing her glasses at the very end of the show she was taking her glasses off. Only for the final goodbyes. Today she left her glasses on for the goodbyes. Maybe shes getting more comfortable about wearing her glasses.  </p><p>Someone said that she stated that she's farsighted. What I find odd is that when she is doing a report she seems to reading from a teleprompter and not reading form a script on her desk. I wonder if her eyes have adjusted to seeing distances with her glasses or if she is wearing bifocals or progressives or if her glasses are just weak enough that her glasses don't bother her distance vision that much?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2017, 17:57</p><p>Robin Meade has been playing peek-a-boo with her spex practically everyday recently (check caps on tvnewscaps). They are off and on at various times during the HLN Morning Express show. So far she has only worn the same pair of glasses that she wore some years back when she first appeared on the air with her spex. No on-the-air sign of the 3 or 4 other pairs she has modeled on Facebook at various times. </p><p>And, it looked like Paula Faris did have her spex on the desk alongside of her this morning. Maybe they are not gone for good?  Meanwhile, Ginger Zee does wear her glasses almost every morning in a preview video posted on the GMA website. No telling where they end up when she goes on the air?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2017, 23:00</p><p>Several of the news personalities have been wearing glasses occasionally, Savannah Guthrie, Erica Hill, Gayle King, Kelly Rippa, Melissa Reyberger, Cynthia McFadden, all come to mind Some of which have become daily on &amp; off-ers. One that puzzles me is Stefanie Ruhle. She used to wear them 1-2 times a week or more when she was on Bloomberg but I have yet to see her wear her spex since her move to MSNBC ( I think).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2017, 09:58</p><p>Speximann </p><p>Nice to see Robin wearing her glasses again. She seemed to have gotten away from wearing them on air. I'm glad when she asked her counterpart "Glasses on or off" that he quickly replied "Glasses on" She seemed happy with putting them back on. Maybe she will start wearing her glasses more often if she sees that everyone likes seeing her wearing glasses. I understand when some of the young lady reporters and anchors are never seen wearing glasses and wear contacts constantly on air so no one knows they wear glasses. But Robin has worn her glasses often enough that her audience knows if she isn't wearing her glasses she is wearing contacts so I think she actually prefers wearing her glasses rather than contacts so she should just go full time glasses and be done with it. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2017, 16:10</p><p>Thank you, Speximan, for the Robin Meade caps. </p><p>Iwas watching the news this morning, to both catch the latest happenings and as well, by clicking around to the various channels, to see if any of the newswomen were wearing their glasses today (again, still or anew!). </p><p>When I first looked in on Robin on HLN, she had her glasses on! Figured this would be a great day! Such sightings are somewhat rare of late. </p><p>A few minutes later I looked at HLN again and she was bare-eyed! Sigh, too bad, Oh, well. Wondered if the spex were there on her desk?  But could not tell. </p><p>Then, just a few minutes later, I came back to HLN as a bare-eyed Robin grabbed her spex and talking to one of her coanchors, she asked, "Glasses off or on?" as she put them on. </p><p>He quickly and enthusiastically responded, "Glasses on." And she replied, "Good. Now I'll be able to see." (I'd noticed her sorta straining when she had them off). </p><p>I then had to leave but suspect she wore them the rest of the day? </p><p>And tomorrow? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;13 Oct 2017, 05:05</p><p>Eyewear update: </p><p>HNN's Jennifer Westhoven has been wearing her glasses every day for nearly 2 weeks now during some of her Morning Express reports. Almost every day she also is bare-eyed for other of those 3-4 minute reports. About 3 weeks ago, she wore one pair of glasses for one report and in another that same day, she was wearing different frames. </p><p>Kelly Ripa has not worn her spex much recently. They are there on the desk beside her, but they have tended to stay on the desk the past week or so. </p><p>CNBC's Kelly Evans sported her spex for about a week, then was bare-eyed for a few days. Them glorious glasses reappeared yesterday so perhaps she'll be an on and off wearer. </p><p>Kansas City's NBC Gina Bullard returned bare-eyed after her eye surgery so suspect her eyewear is permanently in the past--least till she needs readers years down the road. </p><p>ABC's Ginger Zee has been posting video previews of the day's Good Morning America FBk site and she often wears her glasses in those previews, but when she's on the air, she has been bare-eyed.</p><p></p><hr>

Her current choice of frames are flattering and do not seem to age her, but rather, give her a more youthful appearance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;02 Aug 2017, 04:08</p><p>Happened across Lauren Jiggetts on Chicago's WGN morning news earlier this week. And she was wearing glasses. Her FBk (or Twitter) suggested that she'd scratched her cornea and so was sporting the spex till her eye healed. IMHO, Lauren is very attractive without glasses, but also striking with her spex--good choice of frames for her face and her role. While I'm glad her eye healed, she was back to bare-eyed the next day.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Slit</b>&nbsp;26 Apr 2017, 07:56</p><p>@newswatcher 23 Apr 2017, 16:49 </p><p> </p><p>thanks for the update! any links of such appearances?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;25 Apr 2017, 21:18</p><p>Lv2c4i, I looked for the clip but I don't guess it's available on line yet. I'll keep watching, my interest is growing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;25 Apr 2017, 09:22</p><p>Speximan, </p><p>Dr. Ashton was again bespectacled this morning on Good Morning America. The main host made a one-word comment, "Glasses." and that was the end of it. But, at least now, there is a video clip on the GMA website--her piece was commenting on Elton John and a mystery illness (an infection from travel) that caused him to alter his concert/touring schedule.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>newswatcher</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2017, 16:49</p><p>There have actually been a lot of sightings, particularly for those that watch American news. Here I include not only news presenters but also actresses appearing on cable news in the current activist/politically charged environment. </p><p> </p><p>During the week approaching the inaugural, both Debra Messing and Patricia Arquette appeared on political news shows, probably on MSNBC. Both are clearly hyperopic and presbyopic and wore their glasses continuously, discussing their upcoming appearance in the women's marches. </p><p> </p><p>Another actress, Marisa Tomei, posted a photo of herself in glasses in her Twitter feed, indicating her march plans as well. She is also likely both presbyopic and hyperopic. </p><p> </p><p>Because NYC has often been in the news (both because of the president's home and because of the various protests), Julie Banderas has provided news packages from the Fox NYC newsroom to Fox affiliates nationwide. She is bespectacled occasionally or sometimes. </p><p> </p><p>During Charlie Rose's recent absence for surgery during February, various guest hosts filled in for him. Allison Stewart subbed twice, both times in glasses. She is nearsighted but apparently presbyopia hasn't yet set in. In the past decade she wore contact lenses while anchoring. Gillian Tett sat in for Charlie as well. She just began wearing glasses quite recently and I would guess she is presbyopic with very mild hyperopia. Maybe not the greatest sight, but she always appears on TV with glasses now. </p><p> </p><p>Now, some have gone the other way, first wearing glasses at least intermittently, no longer now. </p><p> </p><p>Last year during the election campaign, Nia-Malika Henderson of CNN wore her glasses at least some of the time during regular studio appearances, but I haven't seen them lately. She is likely hyperopic, maybe presbyopic as well. Perhaps the glasses are now on the table behind her laptop while she is on the air, or she is now in contact lenses. </p><p> </p><p>While on Bloomberg TV Stephanie Ruhle used to wear her glasses when she needed them to read, but took them off otherwise. She is now on MSNBC and they are gone. She probably in contact lenses now. Stephanie is most likely hyperopic, maybe presbyopic as well. With her rather small beady eyes and smallish, wrinkle-prone face, she actually might look much better in her plus glasses, even to a general audience watching TV, but I doubt she would consider going in that direction. </p><p> </p><p>BBC presenter Katty Kay first appeared in glasses a new years ago, hyperopic and presbyopic, but she seemed to quit them and go to contact lenses soon after. Quite honestly she is looking older and more weathered, and glasses would actually enhance her appearance at this point. </p><p> </p><p>More recently the syndicated series The Doctors seems to have a new female doctor, Jennifer Berman, a glasses-wearing urologist, and she appears to be hyperopic and presbyopic. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2017, 16:02</p><p>Ginger Z that was,  or the  Doctor. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soeximann</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2017, 16:00</p><p>Actually caught her on the evening news a year or two back wearing glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2017, 05:10</p><p>Dr. Jennifer Ashton on again minutes ago: again bare-eyed. </p><p>However, Ginger Zee. weather reporter on the show, has several bespectacled videos on her FBk page, almost as if she wears her spex everyday, except when she's on-the-air?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2017, 04:38</p><p>Speximan, </p><p>she was speaking about some of the health considerations of the growing number of states that have legalized recreational use of marijuana.  </p><p>I did notice that when she reappeared on Good Morning America yesterday, she was bare-eyed. So, when (if ever) will the spex reappear?  However, on either Twitter or FBk, she did post a pik labeled something like "first glasses ever..." </p><p>So, happy hunting and thanks for the piks and caps you do post.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2017, 00:41</p><p>    Lv2c4i , I have been searching for that clip of Dr. Ashton with glasses on GMA for about an hour to cap it , but sadly can't find one.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2017, 05:13</p><p>Monday, Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC's Good Morning America medical consultant, appeared wearing glasses--for the first time ever, I believe. Caps may appear?  She's chosen dark and very "no-nonsense" frames that I don't find particularly flattering for her, but, they don't look all that bad either. And, in her role as expert, that may be the "look" she was after. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2017, 17:44</p><p>So the alt-right journalist Milo Yiannopoulos is in the news due to some controversial (to put it mildly) statements. Unrelated to all that, I happened to stumble upon an article where he admits to having terrible eyesight, but he doesnt regularly wear glasses. Then I found this video where he attempts to put in contact lenses, but cant go through with it. In the video, he states that his prescription is -6.00! He briefly puts on his glasses, which do look quite strong. You can also see the strong prescription in an old picture (third link). Anyway, I just found it very surprising that he goes around uncorrected most of the time with that level of myopia. </p><p> </p><p>https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-america-divided/milo-yiannopoulos/ </p><p> </p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWi7F51iLM0 </p><p> </p><p>https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p01g41bb.jpg</p><p></p><hr>

It looks to be black and perhaps because of the slightly smaller lenses, the glare is a bit lessened. </p><p>Seems both her working her way thru her eyewear wardrobe and the glare problems offer an excellent opportunity for a "report" on current eyewear styles and choices.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2017, 05:16</p><p>Tracy Strahan, a reporter on the New York city NBC station has been wearing her spex for a few days now.

I wonder if she's resting from contacts in preparation for eye surgery? Or is there another reason?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2017, 05:12</p><p>On the NBC TODAY show, Maria Shriver is this week's substitute and she is sporting her spex. Unfortunately, the glasses she's chosen present a couple of problems. First, they glare and reflect in the TV studio lighting. She needs some sort of anti-glare treatment. Then, the frames themselves are, while trendily stylish, perhaps not the most flattering choice for her. Thus, her spexy appearing tends to be less than wonderful and not a "good message" about the attractiveness that glasses can offer--the glamor of geekiness.</p><p></p><hr>

But reading a little bit about her in an interview back in 2006 she seemed to like being somewhat anonymous. That is why she uses the S.E. as part of her name instead of her actual name of Sara Elizabeth. She said at first before she was on TV it was great because people didn't even know if she was a man or woman. If you notice there are very few pictures of her without glasses which seems very strange since she is a very attractive woman. My guess is she uses her glasses as a way of sort of a security blanket. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;04 Nov 2016, 13:23</p><p>Well, it appears via caps on TV News Caps forum thread that Robin Meade eventually donned her spex towards the end of her news show (HLN Morning Express) yesterday (11/4).  </p><p>One cap kinda looks like she is asking others on the set "how do they look?" </p><p>However, to me it seems as if she puts on, not the new glasses that she wears on her FBk page, but her older spex.  Her new ones seem to be grayish and somewhat translucent, while the frames she wears in the caps from yesterday look darker and solid colored.  Hmmm??  Regardless, she looks great in her seldom-seen spex.</p><p></p><hr>

You have to think that when one of these ladies sees another one wearing glasses on air it gives them more confidence to wear their glasses on set as well. Let's hope the tread continues. </p><p></p><hr>

I'm not good with computers but I did mange to google some pictures of Finola Huges and as well as a couple of Kathleen Kane and your right without glasses they could be very well be twin sisters. In fact i found 2 pictures of Miss Hughes both without glasses and one seems to be more recent and they other appears to be a few years back and she's not bad looking now but she was a real stunner back then.  </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

I tried to google her her hoping to find even more pictures of the lovely young lady but all I was able to find was a picture of her without glasses. Of course every bit as beautiful without her glasses. In reviewing her pictures nor only do they all seem to show her wearing the same glasses but they appear to be on the weak side as well. From what i could see of her lenses they look to be maybe -1.25 or -1.50. So I wonder if she maybe only recently started wearing glasses?

<p><b>Maurice</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2016, 18:35</p><p>OK--it appears that Donald Trump may start wearing glasses to better see the teleprompters he is now using.  Trump is the man who trashed Rick Perry for wearing glasses and Jeb Bush for wearing contacts.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Landon</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2016, 19:57</p><p>Soundmanpt, actually it's more likely that she moves to contacts soon as her need for correction increases. People get excited about news anchors like Lara Spencer or Stephanie Ruhle developing hyperopia (probably with presbyopia) in their late thirties to mid-forties, but that usually translates into full-time need. Which means, they ditch the glasses and get contacts. </p><p> </p><p>On the other hand, if they become presbyopic somewhat later in their forties, it's less likely that they will need distance correction so soon, and they are more likely to stick with reading glasses. So we get more sightings that way.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 May 2016, 10:01</p><p>eyesnap </p><p>Very interesting timing of your posting a picture of Robin Meade wearing her glasses. I say that because like 2 days ago I happened to turn on HLN and Robin was on but not wearing glasses, but it did make me wonder if she ever wears her glasses anymore? I remember when how she came to wearing them in the first place a few years ago. She apparently had had lasik several years before, but her eyes were again becoming myopic and she started wearing contacts so she could read the teleprompter. But according to her the night before as she was was putting things in her bag for work the next morning she apparently forgot to put her contacts in her bag. I assume she wore her glasses on her way to the studio and then when she was in makeup and went to put on her contacts she found that she didn't have them in her bag. She had no other choice but to wear her glasses on the air something that she had never done before. As I recall she got so much positive attention about her wearing glasses that she then wore them every so often for a while. But I have not paid any attention or seen anything as to weather she is still wearing her glasses from time to time or not. It could be that she even went back and had a "touch-up" which is redoing the lasik again. </p><p></p><hr>

It sure seems like she has made the decision to only be seen wearing glasses from now on. I notice that the girls often seem to get into things outside more physical. It will be interesting too see if she takes her her glasses off then if there is any danger of her glasses getting broken or just in the way. She looks great wearing glasses and this may open the door for even more on air newscasters to start wearing glasses instead of contacts. </p><p></p><hr>

Then over on ESPN, Cari Champion (Kari?) continued to sport her spex as she hosted the midday sports center shows.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2016, 06:45</p><p>Lv2c4i </p><p>I didn't watch Big Brother all that much but around the time your referring there happened to be a very pretty blonde girl on the show and she wore glasses nearly full time except during some of the competions which I assume she was able to see well without her glasses to do. I don't think she wore contacts because all other times she was wearing her glasses. Anyway one episode of the show i was a little surprised to see Julie Chen wearing glasses whenever they went to her she did comment about her wearing glasses by appologizing Her glasses appeared to have a rather decent prescription so i can only assume that when it was time to do the show she was unable to wear her contacts. Like you sine the other co hosts of the Talk Show don't seem to have any problem wearing glasses when needed you have to assume that Julie just doesn't want to be seen wearing glasses. We call that vanity.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2016, 05:24</p><p>Julie Chen is sorta-celeb, sorta-newsperson (more entertainment now than back when she got her start). I stumbled across a couple of photos of her in glasses in her gig as host of the USA version of Big Brother--back many months ago. Never saw any caps or word of her appearance at that time. </p><p>However, her never wearing her spex as she hosts "The Talk" when several of her cohosts have at time worn their glasses, perhaps suggests that it is her own choice to not wear the glasses--as was suggested in the case of Kerry Barret. Ironically, on the Talk all the four women hosts appeared once without any make-up,but at least Julie seems to avoid appearing in glasses. </p><p>Does anyone recall any newslady speaking of the "rules" or pressures surrounding being bespectacled on the air?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2016, 19:56</p><p>Erica Hill looks great wearing her glasses.  It was utterly awesome to see Milissa Rehberger wearing her glasses on tonight's New Brief on "Hard Ball".  She is beautiful.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2016, 12:10</p><p>Mr. Cockeyed  </p><p>it could just be that Kerry Barret doesn't want to be seen wearing glasses so she wears contacts. I think now most networks are okay with their female newscasters wearing glasses if they prefer to. My local market I see several of the reports sometimes they wear their glasses but more often wear contacts. Most of them have their e-mail showing as they are doing a report so I have made a point to give a positive comment whenever I have seen one of them wearing glasses for the first time on air.

I must admit she has beautiful blue eyes, even though a bit owly You know there is a unwritten law that networks frown on women wearing glasses, but now have relaxed the rule some what. </p><p> </p><p>Years ago I knew a anchor lady who I know, wore something like minus nines, and she had to take off, while she tended to a infection. Guys could wear glasses, women wore contacts. </p><p> </p><p>Being from NY, I'm sure you have seen Juliet Huddy wearing glasses, then whip them off.  She actually looks very stylish in her mild progressive glasses, </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NYC O^O</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2016, 05:14</p><p>All week, Kerry Barrett was the Today In New York substitute anchor, filling in for vacationing Darlene Rodriguez who occasionally is on the air with glasses. On close ups Kerry's myopic bulging blue eyes were very noticeable and the rims of blue soft contacts could easily be seen. </p><p> </p><p>My farsighted wife commented again about her owl like eyes. </p><p>  </p><p>At one point, she was caught on camera reading something on her desk with her head bent down very close to what she was reading, another myopic habit.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2016, 11:57</p><p>Didn't Sarah Palin recently have cataract surgery on each eye.  Might explain the weak prescription </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2016, 14:54</p><p>Got her start many years ago on TECHTV's SCREEN SAVERS as the "news lady."  She needed glasses back then as well.  Often squinting at the camera.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brett</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2016, 14:14</p><p>Googled Erica Hill... she was born in 1976 putting her at 40 this year.  Could be she's wearing glasses now that are progressives. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2016, 10:16</p><p>I watched the morning news on NBC mostly just to see if Erica Hill was again wearing her glasses. I was not disappointed because she was in fact wearing her glasses again. So in the past few weeks she has done the weekend news wearing glasses and even subbed for the evening news as well and was wearing glasses. It sure appears that she has decided to only wear her glasses these day and has stopped wearing contacts. I only hope that she maybe wearing her glasses because when your about to get lasik you can't wear your glasses for several weeks before. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2016, 17:00</p><p>It was nice to see Erica Hill doing her usual great reporting while also wearing her glasses on NBC News last night.  Sadly, however, Milissa Rehberger was 0 for 3 on wearing her glasses during the news brief on "Hard Ball" this week.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2016, 22:16</p><p>Well Sarah Palin isnt a "news personality" (other than a talking head) but all the rumours about her getting LASIK years ago and wearing glasses only for looks seem to be false in this video. You can still see the prescription in her lenses which dont seem to be that strong for a woman of her age  </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731005515/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sarah-palin-cancels-donald-trump-campaign-event-after-husbands-crash/" target="_blank">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sarah-palin-cancels-donald-trump-campaign-event-after-husbands-crash/</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2016, 06:29</p><p>Again, this weekend begins with Erica Hill sporting her spex.  Makes one wonder if she's decided to go fulltime or what? Thanks Speximan for the caps, including Erica from last weekend.   </p><p>Newsreader Soledad O'Brien, seldom seen lately, appeared as a substitute host on CBS morning show yesterday (Friday) and I think I spotted a pair of spex on the desk. She is of/approaching "that age" but maybe I mistook some other item as her spex and I never saw them close to her face.  However, Allyson Camerata on CNN did briefly look thru her readers (I suspect) on camera yesterday.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2016, 05:49</p><p>I watched a small amount of the Kitten Bowl on Sunday (more interesting than that football thing).  Doing the broadcast were Yankees' broadcaster John "Thuuuuhhhhhh Yankees win!" Sterling, wearing small metal frames, and former tennis player Mary Carillo wearing large brown plastic frames.  While it's nice to see some decent-sized plastic frames, cat's-eyes would have been more appropriate.  And some of the kittens played football better than our local NFL team.  :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2016, 18:06</p><p>A banner day on NBC/MSNBC:  Savannah Guthrie was wearing her glasses on the "Today Show".  Kasie Hunt and Milissa Rehberger were wearing their glasses on Hardball tonight.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2016, 10:17</p><p>Just a couple weeks ago I was watching the late local news and and one of young female reports that is more than a little bit attractive seemed to be having some sort of problem doing a news report from the street. She really stumbled badly through her report and that was not like her at all because she never seemed to make any kind of mistake reading the news in studio or out reporting. A couple nights later they switched to her for a news report and I was pleasantly surprised to she her wearing glasses. Of course no mention about her glasses but she did her report flawlessly. They always show an e-mail address for the reporters so the next day I sent her an e-mail hoping to give her a some self confidence that she might make her glasses a regular thing. I told her I had noticed that she seemed to have some difficulty when she as doing her live report that one night and she seemed to be having problems reading from her I-Pad. Of course I told her how nice she looked wearing her glasses and that they really suited her which was also true. I really didn't expect a reply from her but 2 days later I got a reply from her thanking me for complementing her on her glasses. She said that she was noticing that driving at night was becoming more difficult because she couldn't see road signs very well. Her camera man told her that she probably needed glasses. She went and did get glasses and at first she didn't think her glasses were very strong but she was finding herself needing them more and more. So she wouldn't have to wear glasses on the iar they moved the prompter closer to her so she was able to see it without her glasses. But that night with bad lighting and the small print on her I-Pad she just couldn't see it and she said she really pretty much did her report based on what she remembered. She said I could expect to see her wearing glasses when she out doing reports at night. But so far she hopes to be able to not need her glasses while in the studio. She thanked me for being a loyal viewer.       </p><p></p><hr>

And, on a recent link from YAHOO news (as I recall), she was shown wearing 4 or 5 different frames and styles.  One was a variation of the rimless spex she made famous (and popular) during her candidacy a few years back, but she also had various dark and colored plastic and metal frames.  One might wonder about how vast is her current spectacle wardrobe.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2015, 03:33</p><p>Alex Steele seems to be currently serving as one of the hosts of Bloomberg TV's midafternoon (2p ET, USA) show, called "Bloomberg Markets", tho from the website, there is an earlier show with the same name that comes on at 11a. The network has recently shuffled its schedule and staffing, but currently Betty Liu (and her varied spex) usually comes on the 11a or 12 noon shows and Alex in midafternoon.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2015, 22:44</p><p>  Alex Steele, Thanks for that. What is the name &amp; network of her program?????</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2015, 13:24</p><p>The "unidentified Bloomberg GWG" featured in Speximan's posts of September 15 (22:16) is Alex Steele.  She has worn spex often enough that the "theme/title" video shown to start her mid-afternoon (USA)show features a close-up shot of her in those wire framed glasses that Speximan capped.  Today however, she was wearing different (maybe new) frames. They are plastic and a brownish horn-rimmed color with perhaps more than brown and yellowish colors.  She looks very nice in either pair of frames. Wonder if her glasses will be making more regular appearances or be very now-and-again as in the past?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2015, 04:51</p><p>I saw Kait Parker wearing glasses last Sunday and this Sunday, but at no other time in the years she has been on the Weather Channel.  Maybe she was out partying on Saturday night and couldn't deal with contact lenses, knowing also that the Weather Channel has dopey, repetitive reality shows after 10:00 a.m. Saturdays and Sundays so she would be on the air a very short time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Meego</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2015, 19:31</p><p>@Speximann, </p><p> </p><p>Kait in specs is actually quite frequent, but not a hard and fast rule. She often is on air in the mornings west coast time. </p><p> </p><p>I think she represents a trend of younger women willing to appear on air in glasses, at least sometimes or occasionally. It does vary depending on the channel, though.</p><p></p><hr>

Her glasses are a bit owlish, but this feature together with the clearly visible power rings, and her being a beautiful woman, turn her into the kind of lady that I find really attractive. Maybe the fantasy of being alone with her, getting close, and then being given the opportunity by her to take them off and see her "naturally", knowing that her sight is not perfect... </p><p></p><hr>

Don't know if it's a regular occurrence or a rare sighting.  She only set them upon the tip of her nose for reading and that's a look that I don't care for--she did not seem to ever wear them "as designed." However, she did have a pair of cute frames.  Don't know if I've ever (or recently) encountered caps of her being bespectacled.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2015, 13:48</p><p>This midafternoon, Bloomberg Financial channel featured Alex Steele and Betty Lui as the anchor team.  Both were sporting their spex!  Alex was in a cute pair of metal-framed glasses that fit her face and bucked the dominant way-farer trend.  Betty Lui was in a thick-rimmed pair of cat-eyed frames, perhaps a clearish purple, tho it was hard to see the color exactly. Double delite!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2015, 20:15</p><p>  A few weeks back Today had a segment where Natalie went undercover sorta and she had glasses, planos or maybe just frames in a small segment up close. I have caps but don't wanna get chastized for posting them. she took them off quickly after the spot ran.    She could look great wearing glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2015, 17:24</p><p>You'll be able to ice skate in Hades before you see Natalie wearing glasses, she wouldn't participate in any discussions when they had the Warby Parker segment on or any of the other glasses related ones.  I would suspect she has or needs a correction right now, if not contacts for myopia a reading add due to advancing age.  Vanity, thy name is woman.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2015, 04:40</p><p>On NBC TODAY morning news show, Carson Daily has substituted as host Friday and now Saturday (7/24 &amp; 25) wearing his rather thick-lensed glasses.   </p><p>Yesterday his co-hosts did the typical passing them around, trying them on, and then each commenting about the vision thru his lenses with the associated teasing and ribbing. Mr. Daily seemed to take it all well.  </p><p>On the other hand, newsreader Natalie Morales barely had them on her face a micro-second before snatching them off and saying something about how "bad are your eyes?" Maybe someday we'll see Natalie in her own appropriately scripted eyewear.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2015, 04:55</p><p>Kait Parker has two sets of caps currently posted on TVHeads.com. She is on the "Weather Channel".  In the more recent set, she is wearing glasses--maybe for a first time? The five caps of her with the glasses all have her with somewhat peculiar expressions on her face--almost as if she is bemused (or mildly disgusted?) at wearing the glasses. Makes me wonder if there was some conversation between her and another anchor about the new (?) spex. </p><p>It also is evidence that a smiling face invariably is more attractive than a scowling or even unemotional expression. This is borne out on Tweeted #newglasses photos.  If the wearer is smiling, she always is more attractive than those angry or otherwise unhappy with their new eyewear and/or vision needs.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mr Cockeyed</b>&nbsp;26 May 2015, 07:12</p><p>This morning on FOX5 NY, Rosanna Scotto was wearing optical appliances, (glasses).  I usually watch this show and this was the first time in glasses I have seen.  They look like mild plus uppers, but I'm sure they are progressive, at her age.  She probably uses bifocal or progressive contacts. Said her allergies were acting up.  It's always prudent for contact wearers to have glasses backup.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 May 2015, 10:02</p><p>I recall her being asked by a juror about her glasses and she said that she never thought she needed glasses until she tried on a girlfriend's glasses and found that she could see so much better with her glasses. That was when she got glasses she said. I could tell even during the trial that her glasses were real. I would say probably -2.25 / -2.50 would be about right considering she only got her first glasses in 2010 and the trial mainly took place in 2013. So she could have easily had at least one increase in that time.  </p><p>Recently she was auctioning off her glasses for some charity. You have to assume she got new glasses so she didn't her old ones anymore. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2015, 07:46</p><p>Soyndmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>I had a friend who would vote for a pretty woman even if she said exactly what the Whammy did on "Press Your Luck" back in 1984 -- "If elected, I will raise your taxes!"  At that point, the Whammy would get a pie in the face.  Sarah Pain deserves that and more, and my former friend probably voted for her when she ran for VP, even with his being a Democrat.  (That is not why he is a former friend; I stopped dealing with him long before she came along.) </p><p> </p><p>Case in point:  Jon Runyan played a number of years for the Philadelphia Eagles, and was not bad to look at.  Upon retiring from the NFL he went into politics and won a House seat to represent his district from southern N.J.  Had I lived there I would not have voted for him a second time, as 95% of the time he voted opposite of what I would have wanted.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2015, 06:56</p><p>Sorry Melissa but the fact that Martina White wears glasses and is really quite attractive as well would make me vote for her. The politicians are all crooks anyway so does it really matter? Might as well have the better looking one in office.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2015, 05:03</p><p>Even though I am not in the territory of the two women running for that state spot, if I were, I would have to decide which was the lesser of two evils.  And just because I wear glasses, that doesn't mean I would vote for a bespectacled female.  Sarah Pain -- Exhibit A.  Leanna Washington -- Exhibit B.</p><p></p><hr>

She's chosen a dark cat-eyed frame that is very attractive on her. </p><p>Interestingly, on Friday she had chosen a bold (bright) teal or turquoise frame.  It was, imho, striking from a distance, but a bit distracting up close.  She (or her producers or whoever) perhaps thought likewise as, I noted that later in the broadcast she was holding the spex in her hand--never put 'em down--but was no longer wearing them.

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2015, 12:17</p><p>Interesting thing by Erica Hill on the morning news show.  It's a 1 1/2 hour show, and they first came on she wasn't wearing glasses.  The first segment went about 10 minutes, broke for a commercial, and when they came back she was wearing them.  At first thought they had recorded the opening segment earlier, but she was wearing the same dress and it's highly unlikely she would change during a commercial break.  She probably took out her contacts and switched, as her prescription is such she couldn't have faked that first segment.</p><p></p><hr>

For more than a few months she wore her spex every day and now it seems to be a day-by-day decision. Wonder what has impacted all her deciding--going essentially full-time after years of only occasional wear and now the back and forth?   </p><p>However, her colleague, Alix Steel, did balance the bare-eyed Betty on Wednesday by wearing her metal-framed spex.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;02 Feb 2015, 12:36</p><p>Katy Linendoll, the resident NBC tekkie geek, has a wonderful eyewear wardrobe. For the last few weeks, she's been wearing one of her apparent favorites, and elongated small cateye type. White with a black overlay, very attractive.  But today, she outdid herself.  Nearly all of her collection consists of cateye types, but this one was for real, black frame front with metal temples and on each end of the frame front was a real cateye point, slightly upswept, and a small one immediately below.  Unfortunately they hustled her through the segment with no good closeups and she is so animated it was like trying to watch a moving target. </p><p> </p><p>She's apparently a low minus with a pretty good amount of cyl which may be why she doesn't wear contacts (yea!) but between plastic frames and her animation it's hard to tell for sure.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2015, 17:55</p><p>New York (ABC7?) news anchor Liz Cho wore new spex earlier this week.  Think she'd tweeted some time back her deep distaste for wearing her glasses. Maybe new frames--or just couldn't avoid it.  Twitter has a lot of positive comments about her appearance and choice of frames.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2015, 07:14</p><p>Say not so. Bare-eyed Betty is back this a.m.  The bummer beginning of a bad week? Or just a tempting tease of spexy treats to come?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2015, 05:37</p><p>Thanks for the caps of Liz Dueweke. She is very attractive and her spex add to the beauty. Maybe we'll see more of her as the melancholy countdown to surgery continues?  And, her situation and spexy appearance raise a "philosophical" question for our community, a matter of tastes. </p><p>Would we prefer 'never' or 'never again'?  I suspect Ms. Dueweke rarely (or never) wore her glasses prior to the prepping for surgery? Now we get to enjoy her spexy looks however briefly, then 'never again'. (Well, maybe someday she'll need reading glasses). </p><p>A similar set of countdown caps occurred with Norah O'Donell a few months back--and now never again.  On the other end of the eyewear continuum we find Betty Liu who not only began wearing glasses everyday, but has an amazing wardrobe of spex to share with us all.  And, in between, we have women like Erica Hill and Savannah Guthrie (among others, no doubt) who sport their spex on camera every now and again. </p><p>So, is a pre-surgical sighting "worth" the prospect of then "never again"?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2014, 12:40</p><p>This week on The Apprentice Lauren was wearing glasses some of the time like last week. Quite unusual looking frames with the top and bottom of the frame becoming hinges at the top and bottom corner of the lenses leaving the outer edge of the lenses exposed. The 2 separate parts of the frame forming a long V shape as the come together in the part that goes over the ear. She must usually wear contacts as she seemed to have a moderate minus prescription. </p><p>Bianca also wore glasses briefly. </p><p>My favourite candidate, Katie, also wore her glasses for a while. She appears to have a mild plus prescription and probably some astigmatism as she has worn her glasses for close up and distances. </p><p>I haven't seen the gorgeous Rosin wear glasses yet and I would probably faint if she did but she has amazing eyes. </p><p>Go to this link to see what they look like (none of the ones I've mentioned above are wearing glasses in their photo and only Katie is wearing glasses in their audition videos) This page also marks which candidates have been fires, so don't click if you don't want to know. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731005515/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/DtbQhp3GLWfgscn7BnnD9S/meet-the-candidates" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/DtbQhp3GLWfgscn7BnnD9S/meet-the-candidates</a> </p><p>If you are in the UK you can see Lauren, Bianca and Katie all wearing their glasses by watching the episode on the BBC iPlayer. Someone told me that some other countries in Europe can use the iPlayer without the programmes being blocked and there's also a website that unblocks the blocks but I don't know if that website is legal so I'm not going to put the name of it here.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2014, 16:16</p><p>That's not a lot of glasses, comparatively speaking. Check out Carla Hall (she wears them wonderfully daily) and Gayle King.  Gayle has a veritable wardrobe, but unfortunately, only wears them 1 or 2 days a week.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2014, 09:33</p><p>Really hard to believe for anyone to have so many pairs of glasses. She must have a relative that owns an optical shop. But she also must be at someone obsessed with wearing glasses to take the time to shop for so many. But to her credit she makes her need for vision correction fun and we all enjoy it as well.  </p><p>It would be a nice idea for as many as possible in here to send emails to the station she works for telling them how much we enjoy seeing her in all her different glasses. Who knows if enough at the station her about the response she is getting about her glasses others may also decide to wear glasses on air as well. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2014, 17:50</p><p>Strictly Come Dancing is one of the most popular tv shows in the UK at the moment although me and Gemma don't watch it very often as it's not really our thing even though some of the female professional dancers are quite hot and 2 of this year's celebrities are Frankie from the girl band The Saturdays and the singer Pixie Lott who are both rather hot too. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills was also one of the celebrities but got voted off at the weekend. Today on his show his Strictly dance partner Joanne Clifton took part in "Innuendo Bingo" with him. As well as being on the radio "Innuendo Bingo" is shown live on the Radio 1 website and then put on YouTube. Joanne is very pretty and to my absolute delight (and probably yours) she wears glasses throughout the whole game. I've played the video a few times now mainly because I keep laughing at the innuendos and have to take my glasses off to wipe away the laughter tears - tears in my eyes + no glasses on = can't see the video at all! I have a rather smutty sense of humour so I love this game!  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731005515/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3E5DJVH14&amp;list=UU-FQUIVQ-bZiefzBiQAa8Fw" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY3E5DJVH14&amp;list;=UU-FQUIVQ-bZiefzBiQAa8Fw</a> </p><p>Don't worry, all the innuendos are clean(ish) as Scott's show goes out at lunchtime and the BBC wouldn't do anything even slightly risky during the daytime even though Radio 1 is targeted at people my age.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2014, 04:36</p><p>Back to bare-eyed: after a couple of months wearing her glasses every time she was on the air, NBC's Frances Rivera is again wearing her contacts (well, I didn't hear of any surgery so am assuming she's in contacts). Jo Ling Kent, too, is again bare-eyed, but not before TVHeads posted a number of caps from Monday and Tuesday. </p><p>And Betty Liu wore one of her metal-framed pairs of glasses yesterday. Tho the style is unusual, the frames gave her a more dressy (or formal) look which coordinated well with her black dress and jewelry.</p><p></p><hr>

Wow, she is as cute as shortsighted!!! </p><p>One of you here mentioned her being bareeyed sometime. I presume she is wearing contacts those times... or does she go around in the blur?!?! Any sign of her struggling, squinting or complaining abnout her eyes? Do you know prescription? Would be nice to see vids... could you please link?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2014, 04:41</p><p>Horn-rimmed? Betty Liu wore her horn-rimmed colored frames the other day. There's a set of caps on TVHeads. Again wondering how many frames are in her current wardrobe? She continues to switch and coordinate frames according to the rest of her clothing choices.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2014, 04:58</p><p>Am I right? That technically "horn-rimmed" refers to frame color and material rather than shape?  Horn-rimmed refers to rims (once made of actual animal horn) that are somewhat mottled and brownish?  The post about Carol Costello wearing horn-rimmed spex maybe is referring to shape?  Actually, I think she'd look better in frames that were not as dark as the black she's been wearing (regardless of shape) but if she did wear a more brownish frame are there caps? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2014, 05:03</p><p>Betty Liu has become one of life's little daily pleasures.  Each day wondering which (and whether) glasses she'll be wearing...and discovering it when she arrives.  The past 2 weeks she has been bare-eyed one day each week and then has worn a different pair of glasses pretty much each of the other 4 days, one of the variously colored plastic pairs in a couple of different shapes.  She does well in coordinating her frame color with the rest of her wardrobe. </p><p>Perhaps one day we'll also see a pair of metal-rimmed frames.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2014, 04:56</p><p>Carol Costello of CNN debuted new frames a week or so ago. She shelved her "Buddy Holly" nerd frames and is now wearing a more angular and narrower frame that I find to be a great deal more flattering to her. They give her a younger look. An example of the difference "better" choices in frame styles can (and will) make.eyescene</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SC</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2014, 01:53</p><p>I saw the Suzy Perry stuff too - quite a surprise.  It's not a typical news programme - all outside so I guess she doesn't need an auto-cue but does use an iPad so I guess close-up is more important.  There were a lack of close-ups, so apart from being plus lenses it was difficult to tell if they were single vision or progressive lenses. I guess we have to wait for Singapore GP in 2 weeks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chris</b>&nbsp;07 Sep 2014, 14:04</p><p>Yes stunning indeed, Suzi definitely suits glasses. Apparently she's been wearing them for 12 months. I'm guessing she's always had a small amount of hyperopia but been able to accommodate sufficiently so that it wasn't really noticeable. At 44 that probably isn't the case anymore, hence the glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;07 Sep 2014, 04:41</p><p>Suzi is back in glasses today at the Italian Grand Prix, looking stunning on the BBC. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2014, 13:45</p><p>@ Chris - I agree, she looked at least as gorgeous in glasses as she does without them. Viewers in the UK can watch it on the BBC iPlayer. She wears them for the first hour or so of the programme. Hope we get to see them again :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chris</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2014, 09:06</p><p>Thought I'd died and gone to heaven today. Suzi Perry was wearing glasses during the BBC F1 coverage this afternoon. They looked to be around +2 or maybe a little more. She looked fantastic in them. Curiously though, they disappeared around half way through. I'm looking forward to seeing if they reappear for the race tomorrow.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pete</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2014, 09:20</p><p>:-) Happy, seems that Betty Liu is back now, definitely with glasses forever! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;03 Sep 2014, 05:20</p><p>Upon her return to CBS Morning News yesterday, Norah O'D did speak briefly of her lasik and her satisfaction/amazement at the seeing she can now do without spex. Sounds like the show will not use her experience as the basis of a story about vision and correction. </p><p>Meanwhile, Betty Liu continues to sport a variety of looks from her (apparently extensive) wardrobe of frames. And today she is joined (at least early on) by a bespectacled Olivia Stearns. </p><p>And Frances Rivera responded (via Twitter) to a question and compliment about her eyewear by saying she'd been being bothered by her contacts lately.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2014, 18:21</p><p>One of the insanities about Norah having lasik is that she is 40 years old, and if she doesn't already, will very soon be needing reading glasses.  But don't expect to see her wearing them, with her ultra-vanity level she won't.  She'll either get mono contacts, or keep going to larger and larger fonts on the teleprompter until the inevitable happens. At which time, she'll probably opt to retire rather than be seen in any form of eyewear. Sad to say, she's not one of us. </p><p> </p><p>If she had any sense at all, she would've foregone the surgery and taken a good time from her esteemed (and not vain) colleague, Gayle King, and selected a wardrobe of attractive eyewear and worn them proudly. At this point the remote is my friend, will check on CBS and if Gayle isn't wearing them that day will go to NBS...Norah isn't worth watching.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2014, 13:36</p><p>Somewhat sadly (tho not for her), Norah has gone ahead and had lasik.  If you search for her on Facebook, you'll see a smiling post-procedure photo. There are a "ton" of comments prompted by her post and the vast majority of them note how attractive (or hot or sexy or professional) she looked wearing glasses and how they will miss seeing her in them. </p><p>Meanwhile, Betty Lui wore her blue spex today.  Looks like she'll continue to go back-and-forth, but it also appears as if, unlike previously, her glasses will be making regular appearances. Or so we hope.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2014, 10:39</p><p>Norah hasn't been on all week, but on Monday she did a segment on the U.S. Tennis Open and was wearing her glasses. It could have been taped before this week, although it did appear to be live.  More food for speculation.  Or should I say specs-ulation?  (All together now, Grrroooaann!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pete</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2014, 01:23</p><p>What happened again to Betty Liu, back again but again without glasses. What a pitty, was such a beauty with her glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2014, 11:28</p><p>I notice that Norah wasn't on this morning. Makes me wonder if she is getting her lasik done today? Generally speaking I would think for best results it is best if a patient refrains from the use of contacts for longer than 1 week, however it is possible that she maybe had been wearing glasses for several weeks and only using the contacts while on air.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;14 Aug 2014, 21:20</p><p>It's 4 for 4 this week!  Not only is Betty Lui wearing her glasses for the 4th day in a row, but she is in a fourth different pair of frames. Today is the currently stylish what I call "nerd" frames in a brown mottled horn-rimmed "color", she wore the same frame in both a purple and a red earlier this week (and a blue last week), as well as one day in a thinner black frame. </p><p>With this eyewear wardrobe, she likely isn't prepping for surgery to get rid of glasses.  Maybe she's discovered a discount dealer or bought all 5 of Warby Parker's try-on selections? </p><p>As a financial reporter, she knows the value of a diversified fiscal portfolio and has applied that same principle to her eyewear appearance. Luvin' it, Betty!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>nc</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2014, 16:10</p><p>It is totally awesome to see Savannah wearing her glasses a little more often. She always seems to have a new set of frames to wear and usually prefers the hipster style large frame glasses, which i am in love with!  She also seems to have a variety of lens types also... one day its seems she has a weak prescription (maybe -2) and the next time she wears them they look flat and thick (maybe -5 or -6)... im sure just my imagination.   Either way i hope she keeps amazing us with her glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2014, 08:08</p><p>TVHeads has not been posting daily caps of various newscasters lately.  However, for us ES fans, the sightings keep coming. Today, Savannah Guthrie is again wearing her glasses on TODAY.  And, Betty Liu, on Bloomberg, wearing her glasses more regularly, today has a new pair--very nice. They are the "nerd" shape, but a nice blue color that is quite flattering with the rest of her outfit and her coloring. IMHO, a fine frame choice.  Keep 'em coming, Betty.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2014, 07:21</p><p>Welcome back ES and all.  Check out TVHeads for MSNBC Alex Wagner in spex for the first time on the air.  Think she'd been ailing and so chose to wear her glasses. Not the most flattering frame choice, but always great to see 'em in eyewear.  Also Bloomberg's Betty Liu was again bespectacled a couple of days this week. </p><p></p><hr>

She's in 2 different frames and seems to have a fairly substantial prescription. </p><p>Betty Liu was also wearing her glasses on Monday's Fox Business morning show.  She was wearing a variation of the fashionable (as in popular) hipster type frames.  Her last spexy appearance was in a different, but more stylish (as in artsy and designed) frames.  She looked very nice in both pair, but it leads one to wonder how large of an eyewear wardrobe she has. And what she might wear next. </p><p>And TVHeads also capped CNN's Pamela Brown wearing glasses the other day.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2014, 08:32</p><p>Interested in comment that Norah O'Donnell is the "vainest of the vain."  Interested in what prompts that assessment, tho she is very attractive, especially with her spex. I, too, caught the comments about her being overly fatigued (due to a late return from assignment) as she wore her glasses this past week. But, she also seemed to be much enjoying herself, perhaps from the giddiness that often comes with lack of sleep. And, when one smiles, whether with glasses or not, they invariably seem more attractive.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NYC O^O</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2014, 09:26</p><p>Tne pictures of Norah in the red dress wearing the plano glasses clearly show her large myopic eyes. In the pictures of her in the dark dress wearing her myopic prescription her eyes do appear smaller indicating the fact that her myopic prescription is significant. It is nice to see the comparison.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2014, 23:03</p><p>  Here's to hoping she gets lots more assignments!!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2014, 21:19</p><p>Don't hold your breath waiting for Norah to wear glasses often, let alone quite often.  There was a comment from Gayle King about her being "sleep deprived" on Monday's episode, and she sure looked it, the glasses were because she had a rough night either on assignment or traveling and couldn't handle the CL's. She is the vainest of the vain, and only will wear them as a last resort.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2014, 12:50</p><p>It is interesting that ever since that guy was on the show from Warbly Parker Nora has been wearing her glasses quite often. Before that I don't ever recall her wearing glasses on the show.  </p><p>What's odd is why she is wearing the non prescription glasses. That really makes no sense at all. It seems Charlie really approves of her wearing glasses because he said more than once how nice she looks with her glasses. Clearly off the air he must wear her glasses full time or quite a bit for him to comment on them as he did.  </p><p>So now that she has come out wearing glasses I think she will even be wearing them more often as time goes by, </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2014, 12:42</p><p>Thanks to Speximan for the array of fine quality caps. I, too, think even the plano pics are worthwhile, especially when bare-eyed is the alternative.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2014, 08:22</p><p>Norah O'Donnell also seems to have had her frames adjusted. Last week they seemed to be constantly slipping down her nose, but this a.m. they seem to be staying in place.  Perhaps she will continue to sport the spex every now and again.  </p><p>Also, wondering about caps from Robin last week?  She was wearing an attractive outfit along with her spex--kinda black-and-white like Norah's attractive, eyewear-enhanced appearance this morning.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NYC O^O</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2014, 07:23</p><p>Norah O'Donnell is again wearing her real glasses right now on CBS This Morning. </p><p> </p><p>Unlike last week's first hour of the show on May 16,she is today wearing her -4.00 something pair showing significant cut-in and power rings.  </p><p> </p><p>The photos last week in TV Heads only pictured her in the non prescription pair she wore in the first hour on May 16th show before she switched in the second hour of that show to the pair she is wearing today.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2014, 12:13</p><p>Her glasses are clearly for distance and I don't think there progressives because if you look in the lower section of her left lens you can see that rail that goes form left to right behind her and it is minimized just as the HLN square is in the upper part of her lens. I don't really think her prescription is all that much. I would say something less than -3.00. Because she had lasik generally speaking if some one again becomes nearsighted most often the prescription is not very much. That is why most places that do lasik only warranty it for a "touch-up" if your vision should get worse than -1.25. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2014, 07:22</p><p>TGIF!  Robin Meade is wearing her glasses this morning on the HLN morning show. Also, she seems to take off the glasses during the commercials and when they return to her anchoring, she is seen putting the spex back on as the camera zooms in to her.  Maybe she's fixing her make-up and hair or maybe she needs bifocals and takes the spex off to read her notes? </p><p>Also, on TVHeads.com, caps of Norah O'Donnell from Monday and Morgan Radford of Al Jazeera US is also capped in her glasses--an interesting choice of frames for her.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2014, 06:52</p><p>Bloomberg's Betty Liu wore her glasses on her June 4th show and there are a bunch of pix at tvheads.com. She's wearing a different pair of glasses, likely a newer pair (tho she rarely appears wearing glasses). They are quite different from the heavy dark frames so popular these days, but they look nice on her.  On her Twitter page you can also find links to some video on the Bloomberg site of her from that day.  Also, looking at the times from the caps on tvheads.com, it looks like she began the show bare-eyed and then put her glasses on. Interesting. Wonder if there were comments about the spex?</p><p></p><hr>

Well, Norah O'Donnell did wear W-P glasses the last 30 minutes of the program.  When they came on with her wearing glasses, her male co-anchor spoke of how sexy teacher/librarian she looked and both commented on how attractive she looked in the glasses. </p><p>Norah commented on her having worn glasses for years, that she was "pretty blind" and that her prescription was "like minus 5". She then said her last pair of glasses had cost nearly $1000 v. the $95 price of the W-P pair she was wearing.  </p><p>She wore the glasses the rest of the morning and the final comment before the show ended was repeating how good the glasses looked on her. </p><p>Maybe the spex will make an occasional reappearance. And somewhere soon I suspect there will be caps posted.</p><p></p><hr>

Also, there's a quik video of her taking them off and putting the glasses into their case as she wraps up her workday and says she's waiting for her husband.

She looks smoking hot in those glasses.  i wish there were pics of her before the lasik!  be nice to know how strong her prescription was before that point.  As of now it looks like maybe a low plus or low minus.  Probably just old age setting in or maybe she wasnt quite corrected enough from lasik.</p><p></p><hr>

I have been tuning in first thing in the morning when she first comes on and today was no exception and she wasn't wearing glasses first thing today. She must have had an issue with her contacts and changed into her glasses. Robin Meade looks so how and sexy wearing glasses it would be nice to see every morning wouldn't it? I only wish she would provide details about her prescription. I of course remember her commenting that she had gotten lasik some years ago and when she first wore them on air he had said she had to start wearing glasses 2 years before that. Now i think it is about 3 years ago that she found she needed glasses again. </p><p></p><hr>

I think your younger sisters will find that your glasses don't work as well as they may have thought with first trying them on? It's very possible that they both may need glasses and very possible they to need plus prescriptions, but I think after they have your glasses on for a while they may soon both get headaches because of your astigmatisms. It would be near impossible that they would not only have the same CYL numbers but that the axis numbers would also be the same as you wear. But there is no harm in their trying them. They both probably need to get their eyes checked so they can get the proper glasses for their eyes though.  </p><p></p><hr>

The rimless pair she has been wearing for several weeks look like varifocals, and maybe this is a new pair of varifocals in a larger lens style. She has in the past worn many different frames but all with fairly small lenses so maybe prefers the larger lens for a bigger reading area.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2014, 19:02</p><p>Surprised no one has mentioned Bob Costas' well publicized eye issues. He showed up on the first day of the Olympics wearing glasses, saying he had a minor eye infection and couldn't wear his contacts. Doctors told him it should clear up by the weekend. Well it kept getting worse and spread to both eyes, and he took last night off because he could barely see. His eyes looked painfully red and swollen, hope it's nothing too serious.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2014, 13:59</p><p>Mika more than likely had a contact problem that forced her to wear glasses for several days. Her commenting that she was now able to see the monitor i'm sure was true. but i'm also sure that there was no way she could see it without contacts either. So if she was trying to make it seem that she usually doesn't wear correction you can tell that her glasses are strong enough that she can see very little without them or contacts.  </p><p></p><hr>

Unlike the others listed, who seem to have one pair of "current" glasses (and thanks for the pix of Savannah's glasses "evolution"), Jenny McCarthy seems to have a small wardrobe of frames of various shapes and color variations form which she chooses the "frame-of-the-day".

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2014, 07:25</p><p>CNN's Carol Costello is again wearing her glasses this morning--at least as she reports from the frozen-over Atlanta streets.  I suspect she'll keep them on when she does her turn as anchor at 9 a.m.  She may be wearing glasses as she's somewhat stranded by the weather and traffic mayhem that she's reporting on. </p><p>Carol Costello is a longtime glasses wearer (as far as back as the last time large frames were fashionable).  In her case, I think the bold black frames are flattering: they hide some of the facial signs of her aging and, as trendy, they also give her a contemporary appearance.  (I do not think those same frame would be as attractive on Savannah Guthrie, for instance.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2014, 08:28</p><p>Thanks for the heads-up on Savannah.  I think the brown tortoise shell frames are a lot more attractive on her than the darker solid brown and/or black ones. Also this shape seems to suit her face very nicely. On Twitter, Savannah mentions that her frames are from Warby Parker. I hope that someone will post some caps. </p><p>BTW, Erica Hill also wore her glasses on Sunday.

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2014, 21:40</p><p>Carlos, in ref to you post on Chuck Todd; this was several years ago already and one Monday morning on his morning show he was wearing ultra strong minus glasses, that had a lot of reflection and flash to them, especially whenever he turned his.  They seemed to have less close-uo shots that day, but I would guess his glasses were easily in the - teens. I went into work a little late that day so I could watch the whole show.  So I anxiously tuned in the next morning as I was getting ready for work, and there was someone else, Luke Russert I think, filling in for him. The following Day, Wed, Chuck was back with no glasses and I have not seen him in them since.  It made me wonder if he had Lasik later that first day, took the following day off, and then was back.  Did anyone else catch this or ever see him in quite strong minus glasses.  Would be curious to know what his Rx was/is.  And just BTW, I think he is a great anchorman.         </p><p></p><hr>

Online (twitter) she mentions that she wears the glasses for computer work and instagram has a nice photo of her wearing her spex.</p><p></p><hr>

I'm still rounding mine up, they're scattered in various places in my 400+ collection, someday will get a count and we can compare.  One thing that's inevitable between the large numbers we have, there's bound to be duplications but also some that one has an not the other.

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2013, 14:45</p><p>This is not a news personality per se unless you consider a cooking show news, but no other thread fits either.  There is a Canadian born celebrity chef named Carla Hall who has an unbelievable collection of glasses, wears a different on every day on a show that is on ABC 5 days a week.  Yesterday it was white semi-cateyes, the day before large black plastic frames, can hardly wait to see today.  It's hard to get a handle on her scrip as the larger lenses of course make them look stronger, the small ones not so much, best guess is in the -400 range.  She's around 50 y.o. so they probably have a progressive add, but one thing sure is she is never without them.</p><p></p><hr>

I was guessing the rx at around -4.00 but no matter, she looks great. </p><p> </p><p>But, she's really a hit or miss GWG. On Friday she did a feature piece and was wearing them, and then is the custom right at the end of the hour her weekend co-host comes on and they talk about the Saturday and Sunday shows.  On Saturday she was not wearing them, but on Sunday she did.  When she was on CBS she often wore smaller feminine black plastic frames but then quit cold and this is the first time I've seen her with glasses on Today.  There was a spirited discussion on this thread when she was with CBS as to whether not wearing was her decision or one made by the suits at CBS.</p><p></p><hr>

In all of her pictures she was wearing glasses with a decent prescription. I am glad for the update as i'm sure had she stayed on in her job she soon would have been tortured and killed. Even carrying a gun if her glasses were to get knocked off or taken from her she would not have been able to see well enough to shoot at them.  </p><p>May she and her child have a long life here in the states. </p><p>I only wish Astra had some recent photos to go with the update. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2013, 23:03</p><p>some updates about Marisol Valles Garcia: </p><p> </p><p> "The bravest woman in Mexico" as she came to be called, held the job for five months before death threats forced her to flee. Marisol fled Mexico before cartel killers could make their move, and is   now seeking political asylum in the U.S. </p><p> </p><p>Praxedis Guerrero a small town in El Valle de Juarez, is known as "one of the most violent towns in Mexico" Marisol's predecessor was tortured and then beheaded by sicarios, naturally nobody rushed in to replace him. Valles-Garcia a mother of one, took the position "I'm doing this for my people" she said "This is not for me, I'm tired of all the drug violence." </p><p> </p><p>Upon taking the job, Marisol put out word that her office would police the community and not poke around in cartel business. That move bought her some time, but it wasn't long before death threats started to come in.  Officers under her command reported that cartel sicarios were shadowing her every move. They advised Marisol to abandon her post and leave the town. </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps with the deaths of Hermila Garcia-Quinones and Ericka Gandara on her mind, Valles-Garcia grew wary. When several black vehicles with dark tinted windows parked directly across the street from her office, Marisol made her choice. Within a few hours she had picked up her 1 yr. old son and crossed into the United States. To gain asylum status, one has to prove a "well- founded fear of persecution" With two female police chiefs already murdered, it would seem that Marisol Valles-Garcia has a good argument for asylum.  </p><p>Our mothers, sisters, wives, aunts, are the keystones that we build our lives around.  A healthy society, is one that holds its women in reverence, one that protects its women and children. Once that basic principle of morality and obligation breaks down, the social structure is forever damaged.  Nothing is sacred and no good deed goes unpunished in a land ruled by a confederacy of brutes.</p><p></p><hr>

Since she has been on the stand I have started to notice that every now and then you can see a very slight minification through her right lens looking at her hair. Shows a small cut-in that way.  </p><p>It was interesting today because as she is getting closer to the actual killing she is starting to break down. Yesterday they delayed the trial because her family reported that she was a mess. And seeing highlights today she was crying quite a bit and removed her glasses several times to wipe tears from her eyes. Then at one point even cleaned them before putting them back on. I think there will be much more of that happening now as we are getting very close to the killing. </p><p></p><hr>

Perhaps, she and her producers, etc. think glasses 'work' well on her, particularly when doing fake news/comedy. </p><p> </p><p>RE Katty Kay, any idea of her Rx? They look mild. It seems like when she does wear her glasses, they stay on throughout. I agree the frames suit her despite the nerd-inspired look. Obviously on all these news/talk panel shows she's not really reading anything. I was just wondering whether she is an original myope skipping the contacts nowadays...or is she a newer multifocal plus wearer discovering the need for hyperopia+presbyopia correction in her 40s.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2013, 11:01</p><p>Re: Whitney Cummings. It seems like she's been wearing glasses on pretty much every episode of her new talk show, and I'm not sure they're props. It would make sense if she's mildly nearsighted and doesn't need to wear them most of the time, but when doing this one she needs to read the teleprompter and so wears glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I agree, she looks very good in the various frames she wears, better than without glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2013, 07:29</p><p>Katty Kay, BBC Washington, DC correspondent, appears fairly regularly on MSNBC's Morning Joe as one of their panelists/commentators. Maybe 6 weeks ago she appeared wearing glasses for the first time and the others made the typical sorts of comments on the new glasses (looking smarter, they're attractive, etc.) and she good-naturedly accepted it all. </p><p>Since then she has appeared sometimes bare-eyed, sometimes wearing the specs.  I noted in her latest appearance she was wearing glasses and there were numerous close-ups of her bespectacled face.  She has chosen a version of the fashionable nerd-style frames--dark and very out-front--and imho, they suit her better than others who choose the same styles.  I have never seen any caps of her in glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Corey</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2013, 20:29</p><p>A couple of news or entertainment glasses events... </p><p> </p><p>Whitney Cummings, on her E! show "Love You, Mean It" in an episode that aired late last month (I think January 23?) These were obviously props worn ironically I suppose, but very becoming. </p><p> </p><p>Katty Kay of BBC America, on NBC's Meet the Press Feb 10. These looked real and she wore throughout the panel discussion. I don't know if she has worn glasses in the past, if this is a new thing for her, or her contacts weren't available. I could not tell what kind of prescription, but she is 48. </p><p> </p><p>Any further info on these is welcome.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2013, 00:29</p><p>Astra </p><p>I do see that and it is very hard to tell what that could be, there is a machine behind her and I guess it could possibly be a section of that showing on her lens. Very hard to say? But as you can see there doesn't appear to be any sign of even a tiny bit of cut-in looking through her lens. This is not to say that her glasses are plano but I just think they are very, very weak and could be plus or minus even. But my guess is since she went on trial, this is the longest she has ever worn her glasses. It is interesting how much different she looks from 5 years ago when she was a smokin hot blond. This is a look that has been used quite often to really downplay the looks of these young females.  </p><p>If you recall not long ago tere was another trial where a woman stabbed and killed her husband and she too claimed self defense. She was also a very pretty young lady but they too had her dress very casual, changed her hair color to dark, pulled it back into a ponytail and of course she now was wearing glasses and not designer glasses but very plain looking wire frame glasses that someone her age would never even consider wearing. She did manage to get her years reduced, she did not get off as she was trying to in the new trial.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2013, 00:09</p><p>then this image looks really strange. the white part inside the right lens may not be really the minified image.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2013, 10:42</p><p>Astra </p><p> </p><p>I am quite sure her glasses are no where near -3.00. I have been watching everyday since she took the stand trying hard to find even a slight prescription and even with a nice new 60" HD TV she has virtually no cut-in at all. Their seems to be many shots of her looking off to her right, at the jury, so looking through her right lens I see no distortion at all.  </p><p>I do recall a few days back when she was still at the table beside her attorney she pulled her glasses down her nose quite far and was looking over the top of them, but at the angle the camera was at it was hard to tell if she looking at her monitor or if she was looking in the distance. There must have been something she felt she could see better without her glasses. But other than that she has been very religous about wearing her glasses daily now. When her trial first began she wasn't wearing glasses, so to be honest I paid much less attention. Then one day when I tuned in and she was wearing glasses, then I started following it daily.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2013, 09:49</p><p>I think her best-looking frames are the ones from Thursday's picture at 3:02 p.m., dark with fade to the middle and clear at the bottom, like one of my large drop-temples.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2013, 17:29</p><p>Pseldonymov </p><p> </p><p>Have you noticed that really all of her glasses are not very trendy at all? I did see her one day at her trial wearing a much newer and more fashionable style of glasses but only that one time. It seems they really want to play down her looks as much as possible to make her look as average as possible. If you notice she has hardly any makeup on and her clothes have been very simple and loose fitting as well. Also as you say I have been watching her trial a good bit and even more now that she is on the  stand and trying hard to see if she even has any prescription in her glasses. If she does it has to be a very weak prescription. I noticed once when she was at the desk that she even pulled them down her nose to look off the top of her glasses to look in the distance making me think they could be for close up. Little doubt that her attorney's have told her how to dress and maybe even picked out glasses for her as well. They want her to come across as the farmers daughter type.  </p><p></p><hr>

There is a backdrop with writing on it and there appears to be a very slight distortion of the words in the background. But this could be caused by the angle as well. Probably just a very weak prescription, maybe a minus so she can see the any signs or prompts nearby. </p><p></p><hr>

I spelled her name correctly because no one before did, referring to her as Krysten instead of Kyrsten, and I'm really not concerned about her looks or Sarah Pain's [sic]; just mentioning that most politicians are fat pigs, hence the "pork" term always used in CONgress. </p><p> </p><p>3.  2012 was indeed an eyewear record for me, with 10 new pairs, 8 of which were cat's-eyes.

<p><b></b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2012, 21:05</p><p>At least she's getting the idea that there are many out here in TV land that are finding her incredibly sexy when she is wearing her glasses these days. And don't tell me she isn't loving it as well. I believe she really did have an issue one morning because of forgetting to have her contacts with her for work. And not being able to see well enough to see the monitor she didn't have any choice but to wear her glasses, but I don't think she had any idea so many would be so positive about her in glasses and good for her to be smart enough to not turn her back on the public outcry, but instead take it to heart and make wearing glasses at least a some time part of her attire now. I bet truth be told she is probably more comfortable wearing her glasses than the contacts anyway. That is likely what caused the mishap in the first place. She likely has a habit of wearing her glasses to the studio in the wee hours of the morning as her eyes are probably not yet ready to be sticking anything into them. But when she went to make the switch from her glasses to contacts and they weren't in her bag she was left with little choice. I'm pretty sure she probably tested if she could see the monitor or not without correction and she wasn't able to so the glasses were her only option.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2012, 20:52</p><p>I think we all know she is wrong about us not noticing if she were to start wearing her glasses everyday. Not to mention she of course could always have several pairs that she could change into from day to day. Not only would us guys be watching more but now even the ladies would be watching to see what glasses shes wearing each day.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2012, 07:27</p><p>Some comment about Robin's spex on her twitter stream.  Several comments were positive and encouraging. One guy said that she should wear 'em everyday.  To which she responded, "Then, you wouldn't notice." (Which kinda sounds like she'll wear her glasses occasionally, but not regularly. But then she also rotates other parts of her wardrobe: tops, belts, earrings, necklaces, etc. </p><p>One tweet suggested that her looking so hot and great in her glasses was prompting men throughout the land to get their wives to an eye exam so that they could also get hot eyewear. </p><p>TVnewscaps has their usually daily set of screen caps.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Dec 2012, 10:40</p><p>Lv2c4i </p><p>Hard to tell, maybe it was her own decision to wear contacts more often, who knows. But I do well remember when she was first hired on with CBS doing their morning show she wore her glasses quite often. I would say 3 or 4 days out of a week. And before that when she did the overnight with one of the cable news outlets she often wore glasses then as well.  </p><p></p><hr>

And none since. </p><p>    She had very modern, large black framed spex. I thought they were really too large for her face, but it's what she'd chosen and weren't all that bad. They were actually akin to what I recall Ann Curry wearing (just once) some weeks back for her first post-TODAY show appearance. (Again, no caps.) </p><p>  As far as Erica, I suspect that sooner or later, she'll again appear in her glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2012, 06:37</p><p>CNN's Robin Meade back to bare-eyed this morning. But, TVHeads.com has about 30 caps from yesterday's show. Most are fairly close and front-on views. They show a wide variety of facial expressions and angles. There seems to be very little "cut-in" nor power rings which indicates very low prescription, right? </p><p>Also, yesterday the show's sports reporter wore glasses also claiming a contact lens misfunction. Robin mentioned that she was "starting a trend" and encouraged the financial reporter to put on her glasses if she had any, but there was no response to the invitation/quip, neither any specs nor any comment.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2012, 22:36</p><p>It sure is beginning to look that way. Shes already a beautiful women and now wearing glasses she is even more appealing. It seems there are many others besides the "eyescene" community that must feel the same way.  </p><p>I think each time we see these beautiful ladies wearing their glasses on air is is putting another hole in that wall that says these women shouldn't war glasses on the air. That wall may soon crumble.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lucas</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2012, 10:41</p><p>It looks like she enjoys wearing them as she keeps retweeting positive commentaries on her glasses. If it was only up to her, im sure she would wear them all the time</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2012, 06:49</p><p>Robin Meade is wearing her glasses again this a.m. (12/5).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2012, 10:31</p><p>Lv2c4i and Mr. Cockeyed </p><p> </p><p>I agree that for many of these women wearing contacts is the norm for them and so they of course are not going to wear glasses unless there is w real reason to. But in the cases of Erica Hill and Savannah Gutherie, both these young ladies when they first started doing the morning news were seen at least 50% of the time wearing glasses, but not long after they they became anchors the glasses were mostly gone. I agree that Robin Meade admitted that it was only due to her not being able to find her contacts that forced her to appear wearing glasses. And very understandable that because of the extreme early hour she has to be at work each morning she likely wears her glasses to the studio, goes to makeup and then switches to contacts and most likely wears contacts the rest of the day. Erin Andrews was spotted while working for the other network doing sideline reports more then once wearing glasses some of the time. So in her case it is also most likely her preference as to if she wears glasses or contacts. Overall I would agree that many or most of the women on air reporters and anchors probably choose to wear contacts just because they feel they look better without glasses. </p><p>Like you you said Mr. Cockeyed we too have a local anchor girl that is very attractive and she has been on air now for about 3 or 4 years and she is never seen wearing glasses, but one night there was a big fire and she must have been the closest reporter to the scene and she became a reporter and I was very surprised to see her wearing glasses and much like your reporter it was clear she had a pretty strong prescription. I doubt she will ever be seen again wearing glasses. Too bad.  </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mr Cockeyed</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2012, 09:15</p><p>There is an unwritten law that female news people usually don't wear glasses unless like Savannah Guthrie, when she wore her contacts too long the night before.  Do you remember when Katie Couric started wearing reading glasses?  They almost forced her not to wear them.  Now, she has her own show and uses them. </p><p> </p><p>The network executives want people with no glasses,  Soundmanpt, we have discussed this before, I knew a local news anchor and she only once wore glasses, and wore an rx of -7.50 or so.  Anybody with a strong rx plus or minus, detracts from the overall view.  I wish it was acceptable for women to wear glasses, but it ain't gunna happan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2012, 07:09</p><p>I wonder about the idea of "pressure from above" being the reason for the scarcity of specs on TV newswomen.  </p><p>I tend to think that they are much like other women (classmates, coworkers, etc.) that I've encountered over the years. Most of these have a preference for contact lenses for vision correction and wear the lenses most of the time. Occasionally there will be a "sighting" when the ease of simply slipping on their specs overcomes their vanity or whatever else may contribute to their aversion to glasses. </p><p>Thus, Erica Hill, Savannah Guthrie, Robin Meade, Erin Andrews among others will likely not regularly wear glasses on the air--or even when they are "off the air." We can hope that they might choose to make their eyewear an occasional part of their wardrobe just as they change jewelry, outfits, and other parts of their wardrobes from day to day. </p><p>Finally, I'd point to the big HLN.com headline about Robin's glasses and the big positive response that her wearing then on the air prompted. The "higher ups" certainly saw--and maybe even directed--that reporting of how great the glasses were seen to be.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jose</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2012, 01:03</p><p>I seen rumors that Lauer will be switching to multi-focal contacts---will see if that happens.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2012, 10:35</p><p>Once again I think the powers that be have told them to avoid wearing their glasses while on the air. It was quite clear that both these young ladies preferred to wear their glasses more than contacts. If you think about it makes sense that they would. I'm sure the need to be at the studio at 3 AM each day it was much easier to slip on glasses and go. I really doubt that it has been their choice to wear contacts. It makes sense too that the morning after the election and working late into the night Miss Gunthrie's eyes probably couldn't tolerate her contacts again so soon and the network execs allowed it for that day. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rob</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2012, 06:06</p><p>You are correct- Erica stopped wearing her glasses after the new CBS program with Charlie Rose began. She is now on Weekend Today, and unfortunately the trend has continued every time she is on air. Hopefully today or tomorrow will break the streak. </p><p> </p><p>Savannah wore her glasses on Today the day after the election, but nothing since then. The reading glasses are Matt Lauer's. Clearly, I know too much about this shit!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2012, 01:15</p><p>Revolver </p><p> </p><p>Yes but did you also notice not long after Erica Hill was the morning anchor on CBS she suddenly stopped wearing her glasses and then she disappeared. Over on NBC Savanah before she was named the new morning anchor was often seen wearing her glasses and not long after that she was never seen wearing her glasses again. At least not when I have tuned in. I have seen glasses on the table in front of some of them but they could be anyone's. </p><p>I agree it would be nice to see them both start to wear their glasses more often.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2012, 20:31</p><p>This may come under the heading of wishful thinking, but....  We all enjoyed Savannah Guthrie when she first became morning anchor on The Today Show and she wasn't shy about wearing her glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Now, CBS canned Erica Hill and Today picked her up, so now we have 2 myopes who have been known to wear their fine minuses on camera. </p><p> </p><p>Let's all wish very hard, maybe someday both of them will be seen wearing them.  And often?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2012, 10:43</p><p>I have made a point to check in each day to see if Robin Meade is wearing her glasses or not but she has been off all this week. I wonder if she is maybe preparing to go in for what they call a "touch-up" on her eyes? In other words most of the places that do lasik has a warranty that if your vision gets to -1.25 they will do the procedure over so long as your corneas are still thick enough. But you can't wear contacts for several weeks before the procedure. I don't think her vision could have gotten too bad in just 2 years time. But even being just slightly nearsighted and wearing contacts on a daily basis seeing the teleprompter a challenge if she didn't have her contacts handy. She did mention that she didn't think she could handle seeing the teleprompter if she didn't wear her glasses.  </p><p>Sadly I think at some point she will be going for the touch-up procedure and the glasses will again be gone.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2012, 06:55</p><p>I, too, was pleasantly surprised to see Robin again in her glasses so soon.  From what I saw, she didn't mention why she was wearing them, tho there were a couple of comments about them.  She also toyed with them a bit, at least once removing them during a break (to read script?), but then she put them back on almost as soon as the camera came back to her. </p><p>And, on her twitter page she noted briefly "Glasses = more tweets" and made also a comment about her eyelashes brushing the lenses of the specs. </p><p>"Will she or won't she?" may well be a day-to-day issue for her fans from now on. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2012, 10:07</p><p>What a pleasant way to wake up this morning. I turned the TV on in my bedroom and found that Robin Meade is again wearing her glasses. Since I didn't catch the beginning of the show I don't know if she made any comment or if anyone else made any comments about her glasses. I'm sure she can't use the same reason as she did before about not being able to find her contacts. Maybe since she was forced to come out being a glasses wearer she now figures there is no harm wearing them more often. The fact that she must go into the studio wearing her glasses and only puts the contacts on to go on air which is how she discovered she didn't have her contacts or at least couldn't find them when she was getting ready to go on air proofs she must wear glasses more than contacts. That would also explain why she had her glasses handy when she couldn't find the contacts. I think she looks every bit as attractive wearing glasses as she does without them. </p><p>I can't wait till Monday to see if she will be wearing glasses yet again. It sure makes watching the news far more interesting.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Corey</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2012, 20:49</p><p>Soundmanpt,  </p><p> </p><p>I certainly know about the intentional overcorrection done by many surgeons; this is part of their model in which, statistically, most patients will regress a bit to normal vision. </p><p> </p><p>There are, however, some patients who STAY overcorrected, which will eventually manifest itself into visual discomfort--probably in the late 30s or early 40s. My optometrist told me this is not unusual. Also consider that the LASIK technique as it was practiced in the late 90s was perhaps not as refined as it is now. BTW, I don't know if there were warranties back then. </p><p> </p><p>Another possibility: some patients who are nearsighted will see their nearsightedness drop a bit around the same age, or later on of course, as the eyes naturally change over time. So if a patient has had LASIK, such a drop in nearsightedness would translate into farsightedness. </p><p> </p><p>Either way (or a combination of both factors), I would guess she is slightly farsighted along with creeping presbyopia. It is not as if people suddenly need constant correction for presbyopia alone around age 40. (After all she jumped back into contacts, which is a rather drastic step if you just need mild reading correction.) The process is gradual--that's why there is a wide range of add lens powers from +0.75 to +3.50. </p><p> </p><p>But, if she has say a +1.25 lens power for distance with an add of say +1.25, this would clearly sum up to a greater need for correction than an expected reading Rx alone. Or, she may not even have an add yet in the first place! This is quite possible as well. </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, by wearing contacts the last two years, her eyes got so used to the correction (since obviously they contstantly stay in) that she cannot tolerate being without them on set, so that day she HAD to put her glasses on. </p><p> </p><p>Also, I don't know if we should take everything she writes literally (referring to her ability to read the prompter). She probably can see quite well at distance, at least for now. As mentioned, internally her eyes have not been affected by LASIK. One thing my optometrist told me was that when you are nearsighted your eyes WANT to focus, or even overfocus. In any case, her eyes are definitely not the same as someone who is farsighted in the first place. Otherwise she probably would have had the usual symptoms years earlier. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2012, 09:27</p><p>Corey </p><p>It is very common for most everyone getting Lasik to be over corrected. I know of quite a few now that have gotten it and everyone of them came out seeing at least at 20/15 and even 20/10. This is done intentionly because inmost cases the eyes will eventually settle in at 20/20, or slightly better. Also since most doctors that preform the procedure offer a warranty that if the patients vision should regress to -1.25 they will do what is referred to as a "touch-up" which means they will redo the procedure again at no charge to bring the patient back to perfect vision again. This warranty however does not cover the need for plus correction if and when that occurs. In Miss Meades case I would agree that she likely found that her close vision needed correction and instead of doing like some reporters do and just keep glasses close at hand for when they needed them to read small print she likely opted for contacts to avoid wearing glasses. Her eye have likely adjusted to them now for distance as well as close up. She stated that she had to wear her glasses in order to read notes as well as the prompter. Sadly it doesn't look like unless she has a mal function with her contacts again we won't be blessed with seeing her in glasses again. I bet she now keeps a spair pair of contacts at the studio just in case. It is interesting that she for some reason must have had her glasses in her purse. I know many contact wearers and i don't think any of them have their glasses with them when they leave home.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Corey</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2012, 21:39</p><p>I just went through all the info about Robin Meade, her LASIK surgery 15 years ago, and her return to corrective lenses two years ago. I also just checked her age (born April l969) and I am quite surprised that she began to wear contacts (as glasses were out of the question, professionally) again by age 41. </p><p> </p><p>For someone who was earlier nearsighted, presumably, her focusing muscles generally would not be expected to degrade so early or so rapidly. After all, LASIK does not affect the internal eye. Even for many people in their early 40s who are emmetropic one might expect a pair of glasses needed for small print, not for constant wear! </p><p> </p><p>My best guess here is that she was probably overcorrected, i.e. made hyperopic by LASIK, which probably did not bother her until recently. By two years ago the onset of presbyopia was likely beginning to rear its head as well. The combination of the two forces was probably too much to bear. Hence the contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

And am glad to see the overwhelmingly positive response to her bespectacled beauty. On the You-Tube link you will find several of the comments her cohorts made on the air and her explanations of why she's wearing the spex. </p><p>On her twitter page(s), Robin provides more info about her vision. In the last week or so she posted a couple of photos of her in the glasses almost as a preview. She mentions the possibility of her eyes becoming tired and her having to wear the spex to deal with the fatigue. </p><p>She also mentions getting lasik 15 years ago and how, until 2 years ago, she enjoyed having clear bare-eyed vision, but has had, in these last couple of years, to rely again on glasses or contacts.

Most likely this is an 'adjustment period' after which they will most likely disappear. They seem to go away for just about every female news personality after a temporary 'wearing period'. </p><p> </p><p>One likely possibility is that her earlier wearing (as some of you mentioned) was strictly part-time for distance, but that regimen is no longer viable, and for near vision her eyes won't adjust to her distance Rx, hence the progressive lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

But no idea if they were for distance so she could better see what was happening on the field or if they were for close up so she could see things written that she also was often looking at on a clipboard. That we will sadly never know unless for some reason she comments on it herself. Really we are lucky that she even let it be known that she is wearing bifocals as that would have been hard to tell since they are likely progressives. That is why I think the bifocals are new for her because that is why she made a point about it herself. Since she has had glasses for a while there would likely have been no reason to point it out except that it was something new for her. Again that is really only a guess. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Corey</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2012, 21:11</p><p>@Lv2c4i </p><p> </p><p>I personally doubt Erin has had glasses for a long time. If this was a conversion from single vision to multifocal lenses, it should be easy enough to move seamlessly in contacts. For a first, presumably small add, it shouldn't be a huge deal. After all, there are plenty of public figures in their 50s, 60s, 70s, etc whom you hardly ever see in glasses. Presumably they are either doing monovison or in bifocal contacts. </p><p> </p><p>Rather, I think these are her first glasses and she wanted to 'come out' in them, maybe experiment contacts and glasses alternately, get used to them, etc.,  before settling into contacts for her TV career. Has she appeared without glasses recently? What kind of Rx does she have?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Corey</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2012, 21:05</p><p>On election night (early morning Nov 7), Paula Faris was in glasses anchoring ABC news overnight. The pattern was unusual though: </p><p> </p><p>first phase, no glasses in sight. </p><p> </p><p>second phase, glasses on table in front of her. </p><p> </p><p>third phase, continuous wear for the rest of the broadcast. </p><p> </p><p>Any idea of Rx? </p><p> </p><p>She is 37 by now. If this is just a reading/hyperopic Rx, I don't know why she was wearing them continuously for the last hour or so, given that she wasn't wearing them at all earlier. The usual pattern for reader-wearers is to have them on the table and wear as needed. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2012, 15:55</p><p>About Erin and her specs. I suspect that like lots of young girls, she was prescribed glasses around adolescence. And like lots of young women, she got contacts fairly early on, which she wore most of the time.  They were useful in her high visibility TV career.  And now she is finding a need for bifocal correction and is choosing to wear the glasses (we'll see how often) rather than snatching reading glasses on and off of her eyes. There is obviously no way of knowing what is her actual history (unless she fesses up like she did about her bifocals), but I'm believing there's lots more women who've been wearing contacts all along than those who get their first prescription when age necessitates reading glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2012, 12:49</p><p>Yesterday on the day-long news coverage of Hurricane Sandy on our NBC affiliate, the main sports anchor, Vai "The Tonga Kid" Sikahema (the first Tongan to play in the NFL) held brown plastic glasses in his hand most of the time, putting them on to read something off a sheet now and then. He's 50 years old now, and obviously he needs no help reading the teleprompter when he does the sports, as this was the first time I had ever seen him wear glasses.  Being the main sycophant for the Eagles, he should wear glasses to see how bad the team has become.  :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Corey</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2012, 00:24</p><p>She tweets they are bifocals (progressives obviously), but there must be some distance prescription as well. Otherwise it is hard to imagine why she would wear them throughout these broadcasts. Even older presbyopic television personalities (who don't need their glasses for distance) just wear them when needed. This is why you can often see their glasses on the table next to their monitors/tablets/notebooks. If she went straight from no glasses at all, to being hyperopic with an add as well, then she perhaps really needed them for a while. </p><p> </p><p>The question is how long she will continue to wear them. If she is like most TV news or entertainment personalities in the US who start needing glasses (almost all female personalities, and many male ones as well), she should be in contacts soon. There are very few female tv personalities that "brand" themselves with their glasses as part of their look, except maybe those in tech or gaming. In fact what is really surprising is how quickly even the over-45 female TV personalities go to contacts ASAP. By that time what difference does it really make.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Slit</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2012, 10:59</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>yes, i also saw it and in her twitter also she mentioned. she said "its bifocals, so 8 eyes." i believe it should be 6 eyes rather :) </p><p> </p><p>i was watching her video closely on HD 1080 trying to spot the outline of face through lens to judge the RX. very hard, seems plano almost. but if we go by her word, it can be plano top with progressive add. 34 is a good age to start off with plano tops and progressive add, so no steriotyping allowed by age 40 because she already wear glasses! </p><p> </p><p>she is definitely worth to keep under the radar to watch out for any sighting of the RX of the specs. </p><p> </p><p>:)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2012, 10:32</p><p>Someone mentioned that Erin Andrews tweeted that she now wears bifocals so with any luck we may be seeing her wearing glasses much more often now. It could be she can't or doesn't want to wear contacts. For some time she has been spotted on the field either with her glasses on or in her hand. her glasses don't appear to be very strong. I think its great that there are several very attractive female reporters wearing glasses on the air. I'm sure even more will follow there lead. </p><p></p><hr>
