<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2015, 07:55</p><p>Cactus: you speculated last month about why, in the world of Harry Potter, anyone needs to wear glasses when you'd think eyesight could be corrected by magic. I've thought about this on and off ever since; but I think the real reason is that Joanne Rowling herself is quite myopic and wanted to provide spexy kids with a spexy hero as a role model. It occurs to me that on two occasions Harry's glasses were *repaired* by magic, the first time by Hermione on the train before they ever got to Hogwarts; and there are quite a few characters in the series who wear glasses - see <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Glasses." target="_blank">http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Glasses.</a> No mention anywhere of Harry or anyone else getting new glasses, or of an optical store in Diagon Alley.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;16 Aug 2015, 14:11</p><p>I think most TV and Movie Directors and Producers have discovered, by now, that glasses with flat or "window glass" lenses are pretty obvious and detract from the story if the glasses are important (e.g. Harry Potter).  I suspect, originally, they preferred them even for actors that actually wore glasses because of the ability to more easily control reflections from the powerful lights by carefully planning the camera angles.   </p><p>The actual power in glasses lenses is determined by the difference between the curvature of the front and back surfaces of the glasses and the Index of refraction.  You can have a Plano lens if the curvature is the same for both front and back.  Also, these days, some of the AR coatings are almost invisible and reflection free .  About the only way you can get an idea of a prescription, in a photograph, is to be able to see something in the background, through the lens, or be able to see the edge of the face through the lens and around the lens and look for "cut in" (-) or "cut out" (+). </p><p>One thing I never could understand about the Harry Potter stories was why, with all the magical tools that were available, Harry or anyone else, for that matter, needed glasses.  A quick flick of the wand or a few sips of a magic potion and Voila!, perfect vision. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

Host Gene Rayburn never mentioned anything about it, and CNR had to ask Gene if he noticed anything different about himself and Anderson.

<p><b>Myopic Grant</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2014, 10:22</p><p>I was curious to know in what movie did Johnny Depp wear minus glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myoptrix</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2014, 18:24</p><p>I'm not so sure that Ethan Hawke is myopic. True, he wears minus glasses in Gattaca but his myopia is significant in the plot and Johnny Depp was given plus contacts to allow him to wear minus specs in a movie. In his novel The Hottest State the protagonist is myopic and his sight is described accurately - but that could just have been research. Fact is, not once in 20 years has EH been seen offset in minus glasses, and the Rx in Gattaca isn't exactly off the scale. You don't see Jake G in glasses because they'd be total coke bottles. And now Ethan has plus glasses that are stronger than anyone normally needs at 44 and in that pic just posted you see him looking into the distance with them. Latent hyperopia that he only has to cope with now his eye muscles are weaker? He does say in the TV interview that they're not just for reading.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2014, 01:28</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>tinyeyes -- Yes, you're right re Gattica.  Ethan is a relatively high myope with a prescription that I would guess is around -6 or -7.  Still looking hot at 44!  I've always found his looks appealing because he's not a classic "pretty boy".  In fact, he is a bit unusual looking in a very good way.  I think the same can be said for Jake Gyllenhaal who, along with his sister, doesn't have classic good looks but more than makes up for that "deficiency" with amazing sex appeal.  I also think the same could be same about Heath Ledger.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2014, 00:13</p><p>Ethan Hawke is so cute. I think he's fibbing a little for the effect of his story, and hinting at the truth when he says "everything is going". I think those glasses are just for reading, and he is wearing contacts for distance. Truth is, he has always needed glasses for distance, but with age, presbyopia is setting in (which is perfectly normal) so that he now needs reading glasses to wear over his contacts. When he said "everything is going" regarding his vision, he really meant, "I could never see distance, and now I can't see close either!" I think Ethan wore glasses with his actual minus RX in the movie "Gattaca". </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myoptrix</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2014, 20:10</p><p>My theory is that Robby was wearing and old weaker pair if his own glasses - they wanted geeky dark frames and they seem a bit small for him. Also they're not that weak. Watch the movie! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SoCal</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2014, 13:32</p><p>Ah, David Tennant in Learners possibly sporting his own specs?  I love that hew wore glasses on Dr. Who, even if they were not his own.

<p><b>Myoptrix</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2014, 20:46</p><p>Robby Benson recently published a memoir about his life with heart trouble. He mentions that his Rx is -11.5 though back in 1973 he was more like -3. After Jeremy he was never photographed in glasses - I guess in the 80s, when he was super-hot, he didn't want to be seen in coke bottles (shame). The subject of his eyes arises when he talks about coming round from one of several major surgeries to correct a congenital heart defect and the nurse not realizing that without contacts he is nearly blind. Jeremy is on YouTube btw and very sweet and well acted. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Juicebox</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2014, 15:07</p><p>Julian! </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for posting about Dane Dehaan/Daniel Radcliff. I've never been one for finding Radcliff attractive, but Dane...wow! Shockingly I haven't seen anything he has been in but I shall be purchasing some DVDs asap! I never got round to seeing Spider-Man in the cinema  (only because my local cinema is tiny and doesn't show things for long) and now I really wish I had! That's an interesting observation about him being the one to need glasses and Daniel not but is the one wearing them. There are quite a few pics of Dane wearing glasses out and about and on a plane so at least he wears them some of the time, even if it isn't full time. He looks so good in them that he even modelled for Prada!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2014, 07:57</p><p>I've been enjoying the clip of the kiss between Daniel Radcliffe and Dane DeHaan in 'Kill your Darlings'. Both straight guys, each of whom says the other is a great kisser, and they're hoping to have it voted kiss of the year. Apparently Dane's wife finds it hot ::) I hear the in-word for their relationship is bromance.  </p><p>What strikes me (and probably some other people here) is that Dan is wearing glasses he doesn't need, and Dane isn't wearing the glasses he does need. This is Daniel Radcliffe's third major spexy role (after Harry Potter came John Kipling in 'My boy Jack') and as I've remarked before he always looks really good in glasses. Whether Dane changes into contacts when he takes his glasses off I don't know, but he was full time in glasses ten years ago, so I'd guess he's pretty dependent in correction, like many other actors who have to play without them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ksnl</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2014, 10:55</p><p>Cactus Jack, I agree 100%, that's exactly what I was trying to say in my initial post. You cannot tell what someone's RX is... it's still fun to try and guess...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2014, 09:43</p><p>ksnl, </p><p>Look carefully at the guy with the -10.25 in the Right eye.  You can just see the edge of his face through the lens.  Notice the distance between the real edge and the edge as seen through the lens in his glasses. </p><p>Amount of cut in is NOT an accurate  way to estimate Rx.  There are too many factors that can affect apparent cut in.  Rx is the main one, but Vertex Distance, Prism and viewing angle are also factors.  Even a little prism or a small turn of the head can make a big difference in apparent cut in. </p><p>IMHO there is NO reliable way to guess a prescription.  Guessing the number of beans in a jar is more productive.  At least there, you typically have a chance of winning a prize. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ksnl</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2014, 04:48</p><p>Perhaps... I started thinking about all this when I was looking at this blog... <a href="http://spexyandheknowsit.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">http://spexyandheknowsit.tumblr.com/</a> </p><p>This guy apparently has an RX of -3.50 Right/-3.00 Left... <a href="http://spexyandheknowsit.tumblr.com/image/74722256687" target="_blank">http://spexyandheknowsit.tumblr.com/image/74722256687</a> I thought it was a significant amount of cut-in for a not particularly high RX (looking at the middle photo, zoomed in). </p><p>This guy, according to the blogger has an RX of -10.25 Right/-8.50 Left and there seems to be little cut-in considering the RX... <a href="http://spexyandheknowsit.tumblr.com/image/47453641224" target="_blank">http://spexyandheknowsit.tumblr.com/image/47453641224</a> </p><p>Haha, I'm having RX trust issues! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2014, 03:47</p><p>Power rings are caused by internal reflections of the edges of the lenses.  If the edges of the lenses are thinner, the power rings will be less apparent.   </p><p>The cut-in is almost the same in lower set of pictures.  Compare the images of the Left Eye (right side in the pictures).  Note the distance from the edge of the face outside the lens to the edge of the face as seen through the lens,  They are almost the same distance with both pairs of glasses.  It does not appear that there is any significant difference. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2014, 00:02</p><p>Thanks knsl for the Joe M posts; its great to see him in his strong glasses as often as we do.   </p><p> </p><p>Thanks also for the comparative photos of the high index vs regular lenses of the same myopic Rx.  When you see them with top to top views like that, the difference is quite apparent.  I imagine that also greatly reduces the power rings.  So with lense thickness and power rings somewhat out of the equation with high index lenses for guessing minus Rxs, that leaves cut in.  Does that remain similar with high index or is that also reduced?  It would have been great to see these two pair of glasses from the front also.  </p><p> </p><p>My very unscientific and limited observation is that I usually guess hi-index lenses at about half of what the real Rx is. Comments of course are always welcomed.        </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ksnl</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2014, 02:55</p><p>So I've come to the conclusion that we can't actually tell what someone's RX is unless the individual were to tell everyone what it is.  </p><p>There are so many things that determine the amount of cut-in and power rings. For example, the width of the frame can make the RX appear higher (more cut-in, etc), also, if they are high index lenses, the RX appears to be much lower, you also have to take into account the angles, etc... <a href="http://www.smartopticals.com/images/High-Index%20Lenses.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.smartopticals.com/images/High-Index%20Lenses.jpg</a> </p><p>This guy apparently has an RX of -10.25 Right/-8.50 Left... <a href="http://spexyandheknowsit.tumblr.com/image/47780595482" target="_blank">http://spexyandheknowsit.tumblr.com/image/47780595482</a> </p><p>Here is Kit Harington, it almost looks like he has more power rings than the above guy... <a href="http://kitharington.com/gallery/displayimage.php?pid=10269&amp;fullsize=1" target="_blank">http://kitharington.com/gallery/displayimage.php?pid=10269&amp;fullsize;=1</a> </p><p> </p><p>Now I don't think Kit has that an RX anywhere that high but looks can be deceiving. Another thing to take into consideration is the fact that most celebrities, I'm sure, have high index lenses, so perhaps their RX is higher than we think?  </p><p>Anyway, I just felt like divulging my thoughts.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2014, 07:40</p><p>Isaac Hempstead-Walker, the 15-yesr-old who plays Bran in 'Game of Thrones', wears glasses quite a lot when he's off set.

<p><b>John S</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2014, 00:19</p><p>richeye, </p><p>I don't know where you have gathered your information. A lot of people under 40(especially kids)are prescribed slightly more plus for their distance rx in an attempt to cause their muscles to fully relax. Have you not noticed a kid looking over the top of their plus lenses? He/she is doing that to get rid of the distance blur.  </p><p> </p><p>If what you say is true, please explain why starting at age 13, I needed a +1.00 for distance, and additional +2.00 for reading. I can assure you that I could not see distance through the +3.00 lenses, and I could not see close things without great difficulty through the +1.00 lenses.  </p><p> </p><p>At age 58, I still have almost the same rx, except for a strong add which I prefer for working with electronics. </p><p>I suggest you research the term accommodative insufficiency, and the types of other accommodative disorders. </p><p> </p><p>Your posting reminds of of the first time I went to get glasses. The doctor said I only needed a +1.00 for distance. I didn't need a reading prescription, even though I could not see the reading chart. It appears you think the same way. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>richeye</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2014, 09:32</p><p>cactus jack </p><p> </p><p>I  totally agree,  you may need "reading glasses" in younger years, too. Only difference:  wearing  those + rx  glasses doesn't make the vision of more distant things blurred.  </p><p>Especially farsighted children often get lower prescription than they actually need,  just  to  keep their eyes  flexible.  Or they don't wear their glasses  all day but for reading...(I  was one of those kids  myself...)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>richeye</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2014, 17:49</p><p>hi, I  think,  Chris is far too young to need only reading glasses.  and being hyperopic  you can wear  your glasses full time without any problems in the distance.  you just don't need them,  because you can adjust your eyes for objects a  bit more far away.  so you just need help for short  distances  but  glasses won't affect your ability to see  in greater  distances.  so no blur... </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2014, 09:17</p><p>Just to keep the pot boiling...I've checked out the photos of Zachary Levi and I'm pretty sure his glasses have plus lenses too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KL</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2014, 21:36</p><p>Cactus Jack - thank you for taking the time to experiment and explain! The 2x focal distance actually makes a lot more sense.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2014, 21:00</p><p>KL, </p><p>I may not have been right about the inversion thing.  Plus lenses will invert images.  To get a better handle on the phenomenon, I used a +5.00 lens and a tape measure to do a crude experiment. </p><p>With my glasses on, looking though the distance segment, the +5.00 lens made a distant object (a wall clock about 4 meters away) very blurry when I held the lens next to the lenses in my glasses.  Objects at 20 cm were clear as would be expected.  As I moved the lens away from my eyes the blurry image got larger until the +5.00 lens was about 20 cm away from my eyes.  The focal distance of a +5.00 lens is 20 cm. </p><p>As I moved the lens beyond 20 cm, the  distant image became "confused" and as I moved the lens to 40 cm. (2X the focal distance) the inverted image began to resolve itself into an inverted image.  As I moved the +5 lens even farther away, the inverted image came into shaper focus and degreased in apparent size. </p><p>As a second test, i held the +5 lens at about 40 cm (2X the focal distance) where the distant image had begun to clear, but was inverted.  I then moved closer to the distant object. closer,  As I approached the clock, the image became confused and then inverted back to normal orientation.  The image was large and a little fuzzy.  As I got closer the image became a bit smaller and sharper.  The +5.00 lens had begun to act like a typical magnifying glass. </p><p>After all that, I think Julian is right about the hyperopia/presbyopia. I would guess maybe a +3 where part of that is correcting his hyperopia and he perhaps has enough accommodation left to need some help reading, but not more than +1 or +1.50 for a total of +3.00 in reading glasses.  If this were the case, if he looked up with his reading glasses still on, his vision would be like an uncorrected myope who needs -1.50 glasses.  Not sharp, but not impossible to function either. </p><p>The important point is this. What you see when looking through + glasses being worn by someone else, depends on your distance from the lenses AND the distance of the objects you see through the lens. </p><p>I knew there was some reason I did not like to play "Guess the Prescription" and now I understand why.   </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KL</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2014, 19:35</p><p>Oooh, more people discovering Chris Colfer! I posted about him a couple of months back. </p><p> </p><p>Cactus Jack - am I correct in thinking the background will be inverted if it's more than one focal length away from the lens? </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if it isn't inverted, though. Around 30 seconds into the video Julian linked to, the wall and the book poster behind him seem to switch places when he drops his head down. The same thing happens around 54-56 seconds and at 2:21, and even more obvious at 2:28. (High resolution and full screen = awesome!) </p><p> </p><p>Below is a link to the Q&amp;A; session from the same event. While he only puts his glasses on to read they seem fine for distance too, since he's scanning the crowd: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHxGveDAQ2Q" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHxGveDAQ2Q</a> </p><p> </p><p>He'll read without them too, but not that easily: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn60opD2B3A" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn60opD2B3A</a> </p><p> </p><p>He was in the play "8: A play about marriage equality and prop 8", on youtube here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlUG8F9uVgM" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlUG8F9uVgM</a> . He's not wearing glasses during his segment as witness (20:40 into it), but he is the rest of the time - he's in the last row on the right.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2014, 14:35</p><p>Cactus: I googled 'Chris Colfer' and found several more shots of him reading at Barnes &amp; Noble, mostly taken from a different angle, and there was definite MAGNIfication through the left lens. Several where he starts bareyed and puts his glasses on to read; and at least one where he takes them off when he finishes reading. Although all sort of people use their glasses all sorts of different ways, that strikes me as typical hyperopic/presbyopic behaviour, and pretty much how I used my glasses when I was his age. As for cylinder, I reckon the jury's out on that.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2014, 22:03</p><p>Julian, </p><p>I don't often indulge in "Guess the Prescription" because there is usually no way to confirm the accuracy of the guess. I think the glasses Chris Colfer is wearing are definitely not plano.  The clue is the image of the pattern behind him, seen through the right lens.  He is moving his head around a lot and the angle makes it difficult to estimate the amount of plus.  I am pretty sure that lens is NOT plano or minus.  There could be some significant Cylinder, but I think the basic Sphere prescription is PLUS.  I don't think it is a lot because the image seen through the lens does not seem to be inverted. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

In fact, the visible circle is not the edge of a contact lens, but the line of difference between a strong corrective lens in the center and a non-correcting exterior area (sort of like myodisc glasses) because Jake's prescription is so strong that the edge of the lens would be too thick if the correction was spread across the entire soft lens.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2014, 11:55</p><p>Just bought (through Amazon) the two DVD set of 'The Complete Adrian Mole', screened on Thames TV in the mid-1980s. The neurotic teenage Adrian Mole is played by Gian Sammarco, who is no longer acting but must have been in his mid teens then. He wears rather large Harry Potter-type glasses with a strong minus Rx, at least -5 I'd say, pretty strong for a teenager. To judge from other photos of Gian Sammarco on the web, I reckon this was his real Rx. I find it quite appealing.</p><p></p><hr>

The glasses he has all the rest of the time in that film are plano or possibly low plus; but in that one scene, the morning after the spider bite, he gets up in the morning, puts those glasses on, finds he can't see with them, says "Weird", takes them off and is bareyed from then on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2014, 03:45</p><p>Dave, I think you're wrong. I guess you're referring to the 3rd picture in the 2nd batch. Then if there's no distortion that's a mighty odd ear! In any case, the distance is so small that any distortion would hardly show. I'm only sorry that in the shots Tobey Maguire is in, he's obviously wearing contacts: I read somewhere that he's -4 - in in one scene is Spiderman 1 he has a pair of very definitely minus glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ksnl</b>&nbsp;22 Jan 2014, 18:21</p><p>Dave, I do struggle to find any prescription but I think there must be a reason for him wearing them over the years... he was wearing them before it was "cool"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;22 Jan 2014, 18:17</p><p> </p><p>ksnl, thanks for the shots of Leonardo.  If you look at the third picture in your latest batch you can pretty much see that Leonardo doesn't have much -- if any -- prescription.  His neighbor's ear isn't the slightest bit out of alignment as viewed through Di Caprio's right lens which tells me that his glasses primarily are a fashion statement.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>russell</b>&nbsp;01 Oct 2013, 21:21</p><p>Here's something that only we here would notice: I've been watching the series Breaking Bad from start to finish. Bryan Cranston started the series in plain, almost ramshackle frames with lined bifocals. By the start of Season 3, his character is still wearing the same frames (and within the story line there was neither time nor opportunity to get different glasses,) but now his lenses are progressives. I guess Cranston switched to progressives during the break and insisted that his character did also.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ksnl</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2013, 16:51</p><p>I recently watched the movie Boys and Girls again, not the greatest movie, but the majority of the movie Freddie Prinz Jr is wearing glasses, that makes it worth it.  </p><p> </p><p>Another not-so-great movie, but lots of glasses, is Just My Luck where Chris Pine wears glasses for about the first half of the movie... that definitely makes it worth it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2013, 06:30</p><p>A few weeks ago I posted a note/query about Gabriel Thomson wearing glasses (low minus I think) in the early episodes of the BBC sitcom 'My Family' but nobody responded. Now I've been doing some research on Kris Marshall who played his big brother Nick in the same sitcom and had a long run in BT commercials. Rather to my surprise (it wasn't what I was looking for) he seems to be wearing glasses in almost every pic that's been taken in the last two years or so when not actually performing. This includes photo calls, a court appearance for being drunk in charge, and even his wedding in February last year. To me this suggests that he's a fulltime wearer off stage but doesn't bother with contacts (or he'd surely have worn them to get married). The frames are wayfarer style in, I think, very dark tortoiseshell but I can't get much of an impression of his Rx. It isn't strong; one photo suggested it might be very low minus.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2013, 04:23</p><p>Three queries, or rather the same query about three actors: </p><p>1. In 'Shattered Glass' Hayden Christensen wore glasses that were not plano. </p><p>2. In earlier episodes of the BBC sitcom 'My Family' the young Gabriel Thomson wore glasses, gold frames in some episodes, black in others. Again, not plano - but later on no glasses. </p><p>3. In 'Love Actually' Rodrigo Santoro as the delicious Karl wore glasses with a definite Rx - there are lots of screenshots at <a href="http://www.geocities.ws/electra_the_migfetish_lady/rodrigosantoro.html" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.ws/electra_the_migfetish_lady/rodrigosantoro.html</a> (strange that a geocities link still seems to work) </p><p>None of these guys seems to be seen in glasses in real life. Any explanation? Contacts? Improved vision?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2013, 07:22</p><p>Okay you can see he has some minus (not that significant) in his right eye here, but no rx in the left eye.  </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2344864/Johnny-Depp-reveals-real-reason-famous-tinted-glasses.html" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2344864/Johnny-Depp-reveals-real-reason-famous-tinted-glasses.html</a> </p><p> </p><p>Probably ambylopia, they likely don't even try to correct in his left. The rx ends up looking weak enough to be mistaken for fashion but the poor guy is a lot blinder than most with much thicker glasses. </p><p> </p><p>It's an even bigger testament to his acting ability if he pulls all that off while having such bad vision</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2013, 07:15</p><p>His glasses do not look strong at all</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2013, 17:01</p><p>As far as the eye that he is nearly blind in, it may be amblyopia. Either srabismus or a big difference in refraction can cause the brain to use the stronger eye and the visual pathway in the brain does not develop properly in the other eye. Cactus Jack can probably explain it better than I can.</p><p></p><hr>

One thing that someone mentions is that the -4s he wore in 'The Ninth Gate' were a prop (contrary to most practice) It's gnerally agreed that in real life he does wear real glasses, and I know I've seen a pic of him as a small boy in glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 May 2012, 11:41</p><p>I found a pic on a tumblr site this morning of Jamie Bell in glasses - and a Google search showed that this young actor and dancer was prescribed glasses last year for astigmatism in both eyes and says he's 'as blind as a bat'. At the age of 12 ('back when he had good vision') Jamie, a working-class lad from the North-East of England, played the title role in 'Billy Elliot' about a working-class lad from the North-East of England who developed a passion for ballet and made a career of it. The mention of contacts affects him like the suggestion of putting hot spikes in his eyes. </p><p>Oh, and he looks pretty good in his black plastic frames.

<p><b>I, Glasses</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2012, 10:13</p><p>I've become a fan of 'Person of Interest,' an intriguing TV drama on CBS.  Particularly interesting is Michael Emerson's character, Mr. Finch, who wears glasses with a real prescription (Emerson's own).  The cut-in is significant, and because he is a lead character, there are many close-ups of him, giving viewers ample opportunity to admire the strength of his prescription. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2011, 13:34</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agree with tinyeyes.  I'll bet at least -7/-8 and the lenses probably are flat fronts which you see in so many rimless glasses even when the prescription is under -5.  I think the goal with rimless is to make them as thin as possible even if the plano fronts imply a hefty prescription which might not be there.  Anyway, Chace is a doll with or without glasses.

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2011, 16:36</p><p>Hey Julian. My take on it is that plus glasses distort the eyes much more than do minus lenses, and I think that the "blind without glasses" effect would be most evident with a pair of strong plus glasses. I don't know...lol, that's just the first thug that came to mind. Of course, I think most of us here would be able to distinguish the difference between weaker and stronger minus lenses, but I think the distortion caused by the plus lenses may have been why they decided to do that. I've actually never read that book before, but I've heard that it was good. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2011, 15:05</p><p>I could never make out why they made Elijah Wood wear plus glasses to play Jonathan Safran Foer, who is himself pretty Myopic. An ideas, anyone?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2011, 11:15</p><p>Of interest.  Note that the writer has mischaracterized the character's refreactive error as myopia: </p><p> </p><p>"LORD OF THE RINGS star ELIJAH WOOD had to don such thick glasses for his role in new film EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED, he was forced to wear reverse strength contact lenses so he could actually see. </p><p> </p><p>Wood, who is himself shortsighted, had to play a character with an even more severe case of myopia, and his central costume piece caused a lot more problems than he'd anticipated. </p><p> </p><p>He says, "We had to figure it out because they were +7 lenses, so they were magnified to the point where looking through it,everything was a massive fish bowl and I couldn't see. </p><p> </p><p>"And I'm actually relatively blind myself. So, we had to get contact lenses that were -10 to offset the balance so that I could actually see. And I could see relatively well. </p><p> </p><p>"But there were a couple of days where we didn't get the contacts properly sorted out and that was kind of complex.""</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 May 2011, 19:40</p><p>SoCal Girl - I am a bit surprised as you west coast girls are usually much more trendy than the ladies in the midwest. The Hollywood chicks seem to be heavy into that style these days. Maybe it will be up to you to show them how it's done. Wear those glasses with pride. Trust me it should say something that Hooter girls are into it, as well as a few other less known sports bars. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SoCal Girl</b>&nbsp;06 May 2011, 16:22</p><p>Soundmanpt- </p><p>Actually, the frames are by Moscot (located in NY, so I have to find a retailer out here on the West Coast in the Los Angeles area) and the style is Nebb (www.moscot.com). I still have yet to build up the courage to wear them. Currently, I depend on my L.A. Eyeworks glasses in Echo Park only as a backup to my contacts (which is rare for me). I would wear them more often but Southern Californians, especially here in both Los Angeles and Orange County,  are not too keen on wearing specs. I suppose we're all to vain on this coast.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 May 2011, 12:54</p><p>SoCal Girl - I'm sure you don't give yourself enough credit. I bet they look amazing on you. I think they are Ray-Bans Wayfare model correct? I have placed several orders for some of my young female friends at Hooter's and another sports bar. They are a hot item around here these days. Fact is I have 3 pairs on order right now and my guess they will be gone within a week. I get them with -.50 lenses because we use them for samples as well. Also the non-profit group won't pay for non-prescription glasses. So I would be out my own money. By the way I do turn the money into our group and then reorder some more.  </p><p>The ones I get are very well made knock offs of the real Ray Bans from zenni. Total cost is only $15.00 with lenses and AR coating. My friend at Pearle Vision pulled a real Ray-Ban off her rack and compared them. They are the exact same except the words Ray-Ban on the temples.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SoCal Girl</b>&nbsp;06 May 2011, 11:35</p><p>Ah, Paul Rudd looks amazing in those frames (I have the exact same ones), I just wish I pulled them off better as a girl (they're quite bold).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;19 Apr 2011, 12:00</p><p>Myopic Grant, </p><p>LEGALLY BLIND is defined by LAW to determine eligibility for government aid or assistance.  It is really not applicable in this instance, but it sounds dramatic for the TV audience. </p><p>Legally Blind means that a person's best CORRECTED vision in one eye is 20/200 or worse or has a visual field of 20 degrees or less instead of the usual 180 degrees. In other words, there is just no known way to improve it. </p><p>My first Rx was -1.50 in one eye and Plano in the other.  I could not make out the big E (20/200) line with the -1.50 eye without correction.  With correction my vision was better than 20/20 so I was not "Legally Blind" in that eye or "Legally Blind" at all.  A person could need -20 myodiscs and they corrected him to better than 20/200 he would not be Legally Blind".  Because very high plus glasses can have very limited fields of vision, it is possible that while a person can see better than 20/200 straight ahead with correction, it is possible that they are "Legally Blind" because their field of vision is less than 20 degrees. </p><p>Jimmy Fallon could be "Legally Blind" if he could not be corrected.  Obviously, he can be corrected - probably with glasses, contacts, or Lasik- so he was not and is not LEGALLY BLIND. </p><p>The key point is the person can't see better than 20/200 WITH the best possible correction.  20/200 can occur without as low as -1.50 so it really depends on the visual acuity after correction. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ksnl</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2011, 15:26</p><p>I think Jake Gyllenhaal has Keratoconus... I saw that he has intacs inserted into his corneas in this pic: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31161629@N06/3612088008/in/set-72157619425294005/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/31161629@N06/3612088008/in/set-72157619425294005/</a> posted on here a while back. I know what this looks like because my cousin, aunt and a friend's dad have all had this done for keratoconus. It's when the cornea keeps changing shape or something... I know that if you have keratoconus your rx keeps changing so they usually opt for contacts, the reason he would never be seen in glasses. The corneal intact surgery would improve eyesight but not make it anywhere near perfect, he would still need correction. Like my cousin who has had the operation and still has poor eyesight. Keratonus varies in severity from person to person. Here's info on it and pics of intacs: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratoconus</a></p><p></p><hr>

I'm not much good at telling RX etc, but I also remember reading that he was supposed to wear glasses, so maybe he's beginning to do so.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2010, 02:37</p><p>Extract from an interview with Daniel Radcliffe: </p><p>Do you wear glasses when you're not playing Harry Potter? </p><p>I'm supposed to but I always lose them or a lens falls out or something. So after we went through three pairs, we stopped buying them. I even managed to break my Harry Potter glasses at one stage. But there were a lot of pairs, a whole row of them in the prop department. </p><p>Maybe his eyesight is catching up with him. I have a photo of him in Boy Scout uniform, wearing round wire glasses, not quite Harry Potter but not all that different. I can't find any reference to him dressing like that in any film, and I wonder if those were his own glasses a few years ago. </p><p>I don't like those frames in 'OUT' but they're not quite as bad as the ones Elijah Wood wears when he takes his contacts out!</p><p></p><hr>

It would have been a more powerful statement since he's an advocate for donating glasses to the needy and to say "hey, I wear glasses and there is nothing wrong with it."  Maybe they thought wearing his strong glasses with significant cut-in would make him less recognizable.  I'd say he's between -8 and -10.  I always knew his prescription would be high since his father's glasses were strong...  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>russell</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2008, 10:10</p><p>I'm feeling like a lot of you...scriptfinder is pulling our legs.  Unless this guy is a Hollywood insider (or a Hollywood optician,) it is not likely that these prescriptions are anything more than speculation.  Agents don't just hand out personal information willy-nilly--especially if it is something that is so personal that it rarely becomes general knowledge to even our closest associates.  I mean, consider this:  no one I know has any idea what my prescription is (and they've never asked,) much less someone I've hired to promote me (if that were the case.)  I can hear the conversation now between Agent and Perry:  "Now, Matt, I'm going to need to know your glasses prescription because the public is clamoring to know, and if they don't know, then you probably won't get hired any more for your acting."  "Oh, that makes sense, Agent.  Here it is."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2008, 02:01</p><p>...or somewhere.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2008, 15:48</p><p>I find if very hard to believe that Matthew Perry's agent would know his prescription, let alone give it out.  Why doesn't he just give out his medication list to strangers while he's at it?  I've seen close up pictures of Matthew in glasses, and he's more like -1.75.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>russell</b>&nbsp;14 May 2008, 08:29</p><p>I watched the latest episode of NCIS last night.  The doctor's assistant, a character named Palmer, has always worn glasses.  He is a fairly young man--I would think well under thirty.  I always thought the glasses were just plano to establish his nerdy character.  In last night's episode, Palmer was featured far more than he has ever been.  In fact, the entire story revolved around him.  So there were lots of closeups of his face.  The glasses are lined bifocals!!  I couldn't believe it.  It would be interesting to hear what led to his prescription, since there seems to be so little correction for distance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2008, 21:01</p><p>There is significant cut-in showing in the picture of Justin Bartha. Trying to estimate Rx from the cut-in can be complicated.  Cut-in is a combination of the strength of the Rx, the size of the frames and of the face, the angle at which the head is turned and the distance of the lenses from the eyes. </p><p> </p><p>I can make pretty good estimates if the lenses are mostly minus -- without a lot of cylinder or especially prism.  In the case of Bartha, I'd estimate at least -5 or -6, possibly more. </p><p> </p><p>I base this on the amount of visible cut-in with the head only slightly turned (and frames that aren't excessive large or small) combined with the apparent minification of his eyes in proportion to his face and the minification of objects behind him as seen through his left lens. </p><p> </p><p>Note how tiny and moved over the white pillar looks as seen through his left lens.  Also the top of his ear as seen through the lens is so small you can't really see it.  The angle of the pillar through the lens makes me suspect some cylinder for astigmatism. </p><p> </p><p>Technical details aside, he looks really sexy in those glasses.  I'd love to have him take them off and then lean close to see see me with his big, bare brown eyes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2008, 15:09</p><p>This isn't really about an actor so much as some interesting conversation I heard on an episode of "A Different World" (sitcom from the 80's or 90's I guess, in reruns. I've never watched it before, but this got my attention). This girl Whitney had a hot dream about this guy Dwayne, who wears round metal glasses with sunglass clip-ons (as with most glasses on TV characters, I couldn't discern much, if any, rx). She was talking about it to her friend, who collapsed into laughter and said "I just want to know one thing: Did he have his glasses on? Did they get steamed up?" (yes, technically that's 2 things, but anyway...). She said it laughing, like what a joke it was that Whitney found this four-eyed guy hot, but for someone like Us (like me), mmmm, what a great picture! Then later Whitney is describing her dream to someone else, but tries to avoid naming names: "My companion and I wear floating along a stream in a canoe, when suddenly the stream turned into a raging river! The boat started rocking so hard that Dwayne's glasses, uh, I mean my companion's glasses, flew off!" Then she went on about how they were "tossing back and forth and back and forth... And I've never "canoed" before, but despite my inexperience, I found myself "paddling" with passion and gusto, over and over and over...!" Yeah, I know the feeling, Whit. Anyway, I though that was cool. </p><p> </p><p>I ALWAYS make passes at (and occasionally dream about) guys who wear glasses, Marie </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Apparently the lad was so short-sighted that he was turned down by both the army and the navy and only allowed to enlist because his father used his influence. He is played by the lovely Daniel Radcliffe, who at 18 is just the same age as Jack when he died. With a certain inevitability, the glasses he wears are plano (gold ovals). </p><p>Odd how many times Daniel gets parts that require him to wear glasses...there's a shot of him among the Google images in Scout uniform and round glasses, not unlike the Harry Potter ones but not identical.</p><p></p><hr>

As we put together the look, it was becoming this sort of geek-chic thing, it seemed to make sense to add a pair of specs to that.  There was one point where I was thinking about having them on all the time, but that got a bit of resistance from some people, and maybe they were right; I don't know.  I quite like the idea of there being a speccy hero, I mean it certainly hasn't done Harry Potter any harm.  And maybe because I grew up "speccy four eyes" in school, I would have quite liked to have had support from the Doctor on that.  It just seemed right.""</p><p></p><hr>

(on The three Stooges)?  </p><p>Well Shemp also acted solo in movies in the 40's and 50's. He used to put on very thick Rx glasses and would bumble around as an extremly nearsighted man who would bump into things and talk to statues. He would bump into people and then tell them to watch they are going. Sometimes he would play a doctor who is about to operate on someone. </p><p>The guy was a riot.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doreen</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2006, 08:01</p><p>Drak Eyes: I haven't really noticed different eye colours, although sometimes they seem a bit more green than brown, but hardly noticeable if you don't pay really close attention to it. </p><p> </p><p>I also noticed DiNozzo in glasses in the early episodes. Sometimes you can see a pair of glasses lying on his desk which is probably when Michael is bare-eyed and puts on his glasses during the breaks. They could have made DiNozzo a contacts wearer who wears glasses from time to time like when he works a long shift or when they stay abroad for some time. That would be great for us ;-) </p><p> </p><p>I totally agree with you. TV people really have prejudices concerning what kind of person should appear in glasses. It would be more realistic if more people appeared wearing glasses or contact lenses (and glasses in the evenings) because there are so many out there in the real world. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dark Eyes</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2006, 12:23</p><p>Thanks Doreen, I missed the beginning of that one and missed the repeat a few weeks ago, typical! Ill have to wait for it to come round again. I read on one of the fan sites where they were discussing his eye colour that it keeps changing because he wears different colour contacts, although I cant say Ive noticed that, they always seem a lovely hazel to me.  </p><p> </p><p>They did have DiNozzo in glasses for a brief time in one of the early episodes, but they were not a pair that suited him and they must have decided it wasnt right for the character, who relies on his looks to flirt with women, but with the right glasses and Michael has some very nice ones, I think it would work. Works for me anyway! </p><p> </p><p>Its a shame the TV people always seem to think that only doctors or computer nerds or something wear glasses, not hot, young, playful skirt chasers, like DiNozzo, as though they would be less attractive with glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

Thanks sorry so unclear and un knowledgeable !!!  ( I love near/far sitedness- infact I wish I needed glasses enough that my mom would notice!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dark Eyes</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2006, 18:19</p><p>Doreen, do you remember which episode that was, when you saw Michael Weatherly wearing contacts? I must have missed it, Ive never managed to spot them. </p><p> </p><p>Yes, I agree the camera glasses were definitely prescription, and wow, did he look good in them, they also appeared to be hi index like the link I posted.  I also thought the palm tree in that picture looked very small, Wayne, but I was confused by the lack of rings, as I didnt realise hi index could work so effectively. </p><p> </p><p>Michael also seems to wear prescription sunglasses at every possible opportunity, and leave them on until the last second before it would look strange him wearing them indoors. </p><p> </p><p>Another thing is that Im convinced every time he has to look at the computer or on the wall mounted TV, he is squinting.  Except I think that if he is saying lines then he knows what is supposed to be on the screen, so technically he would not actually need to see what was on it.  In one scene Ziva draws his attention to something she is looking at on the computer, and he leans over her shoulder, squints and then gets closer and closer to the screen, squinting more until his face is right next to hers, before finally commenting on whatever it was she was showing him.  I know they do adlib occasionally on the show, so unless that part wasnt scripted or something, it just intrigues me when he does it.  Its even more strange because his character is supposed to have perfect eyesight, unless they think nobody would notice. </p><p> </p><p>How I wish they would find an excuse to put his character in glasses, he is hot anyway, but with the glasses, he is incredibly hot. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2006, 10:34</p><p>There was a show about a totally blind cop a couple of years ago and I remember they did a close up of the guy's eyes and you could clearly see RGP lenses. </p><p> </p><p>Where was the continuity guy?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doreen</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2006, 07:32</p><p>I've seen an episode of Navy CIS, in which Michael Weatherly is one of the leading actors, recently and at the very beginning there was a close-up of his eyes and I could clearly see that he wore contact lenses. There have been some episodes in which he wore "camera glasses" (like the ones Tom Cruise wore in Mission Impossible 1) and they were definitely prescription glasses. So I guess he wears contacts sometimes and sometimes he acts bare-eyed. The funny thing is that his character often makes jokes about his boss's bad vision.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2006, 18:26</p><p>Years ago Michael Weatherly was on a soap called "Loving". I remember when he wore glasses as the character and as himself. I think they did an interview where they asked what he had in common with his character and it was his round metal glasses. This was 1992. I actually met him and his wife back then at some convention when they were signing autographs. He's now in his mid to late 30's, she's 33. They had a child and divorced around 1994. Maybe this sounds nuts, but I have noticed his wearing glasses for years. On the show with Jessica Alba, he had these small glasses. On Loving, it was great as they were cool glasses for the time.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With regard to Jensen Ackles, isn't that a photo from a tv show/movie? How do we know they are real lenses? Years ago when he too was on a daytime soap opera, there were photos of him in glasses. This was 1999-2000. I couldn't tell if he was near or farsighted.  </p><p> </p><p>Also, I was watching this show last night on the Sci-fi channel called Eureka, and saw this character with thick -5 I guess or more lenses. I emailed him on "MySpace" as I found him there. He says he has a strong prescription. The character's name is Fargo and it's listed in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/" target="_blank">http://www.imdb.com</a> I forget his name. </p><p> </p><p>Oh, lastly, somehow I found Corky Pigeon. I emailed him too and at first was just friendly. I finally got around to asking if he still wore glasses/contacts. He said he gradually didn't need them anymore. He said he had lazy eyes when on "Silver Spoons" and astigmatism. I don't know if he just doesn't want to admit he wears contacts. </p><p> </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2006, 12:53</p><p>Michael Weatherly has some great frames.  I wonder how many different pairs he has?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rob</b>&nbsp;02 Sep 2006, 03:06</p><p>Yup, Michael is pretty nearsighted, at least -4; certainly couldn't read a book without holding it close and I bet he's a  major-league squinter!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;01 Sep 2006, 22:28</p><p>Judging by the minification, I'd say -5 is much closer that -2 for Michael Weatherly. With hi-index lenses and possibly glare free coating you wouldn't necessarily see rings.  Note how small the palm tree looks through the lens in one picture.  The stronger the lens, the smaller things will look through it --rings or not.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dark Eyes</b>&nbsp;31 Aug 2006, 15:51</p><p>Yes that picture of Jensen Ackles is from an episode of Dark Angel, The Beresford Agenda, but very nice. I had no idea he actually wore glasses but although they are hard to find there are a few glimpses. </p><p> </p><p>I think it may have been wishful thinking to say Michael Weatherly was -5, but I still think he is more than -2.

<p><b></b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2006, 21:56</p><p>The glasses that Michael Landon wore back in the late 70's, early 80's looked fairly strong.  They were those large ones all the men were wearing back then, frameless on the bottom and sides, tinted lenses and I would say he was a -4 or -5.  Larry Hagman also wears those types of frames.  He's probably a -6 looking at recent interviews of him on Entertainment Tonight.  The good old days before high index...  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hollie</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2005, 14:27</p><p>I used to wear glasses for far-sightedness for a couple of years from the ages of about 9 to 11, and now I'm short-sighted!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Furtive</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2005, 12:34</p><p>Yes, I think it's possible for a hyperopic child to eventually "outgrow" the condition and end up myopic.  But it is also possible for the child to outgrow their need for glasses but remain hyperopic, in which case they end up needing glasses again at some point as adults. </p><p>I knew a couple of kids who wore thick plus glasses as little kids but then were told they didn't need glasses anymore - or needed them only for reading - when they were 13 or so.  I think there's some threshold of hyperopia for which glasses are usually prescribed for young children in order to prevent strabismus, or amblyopia if the eyes are very different, but when the kids are older these aren't really risks anymore, so if the kid has decent acuity then glasses aren't needed at that point.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2005, 10:27</p><p>I believe that I've heard that hyperopia in a young child can decrease over time to where they need weaker glasses or even no glasses.   </p><p> </p><p>It would make sense as it would be the same as the progression of myopia -- the eyeball grows (or stretches?) longer.  For myopes their eyesight gets worse, but hyperopes eyesight would get better.  </p><p> </p><p>I suppose that would mean one could start out hyperopic as a young child and end up myopic as one gets older.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Seeker</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2005, 19:52</p><p>The glasses worn by Elijah Wodd in the trailer for Everything is illuminated are pretty awesome. I know this has been mentioned before and how he had to have suitable contacts for his normal shortsightedness and to compensate for the glasses. Must have been tricky at times. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Furtive</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2005, 19:18</p><p>I've seen some shows about the making of the Harry Potter movies and in them the actor has stated that there are multiple pairs of glasses - some have no lenses at all in fact - and that it depends on what sort of reflection they want to get, or whether they want no reflection at all. </p><p>There are a number of magazine articles and such in which Radcliffe has been asked whether he wears glasses in real life.  In the oldest ones he stated that he had glasses that he rarely wore - and the stories that came out when he was first chosen for the role often reported that he wore glasses, just like his character.   In one case he said that he was supposed to wear glasses for reading, but didn't usually wear them. However, when he's been asked about this more recently (during the time of the release of the last two movies) he has stated that he used to wear glasses but doesn't need them anymore.  This sounds as though he might be one of those farsighted children who outgrows the need for glasses (at least temporarily) as he ages.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b><a href="http://eyescene.net/bbs/real.html" target="_blank">Julian</a></b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2005, 03:48</p><p>Here's an extract from an interview with Carmine Giovinazzo: </p><p>CSI Files: Fans have taken note of Danny's new glasses, which he didn't wear in the CSI: Miami episode ("MIA/NYC--NonStop") that introduced the NY cast. Why the change?  </p><p>Giovinazzo: That was part of the character. We're creating a character and I think [the addition of the glasses] worked out for the best. They might come off at some point. I've kind of gotten used to them. Once [I] put those on, you know who this guy is. It's not me, although I do wear glasses.  </p><p>CSI Files: Did that have anything do with the addition of the glasses?  </p><p>Giovinazzo: No, no, it was completely a decision that was made as we were beginning to do the show. [Though i]f I took them off, I couldn't see things. I'm blind without them.  </p><p>CSI Files: It sounds like it was a good addition then.  </p><p>Giovinazzo: It's nice. I don't have to do [the show] with my contacts on all the time. I can let my eyes breathe.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2005, 08:26</p><p>Carmine Giovinazzo wears prescription glasses as his character. I read that the producers wanted his character to wear glasses, and he happened to wear glasses. Those frames were chosen by CBS. </p><p> </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Agnes</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2005, 15:56</p><p>Do you watch CSI-NY? I like (of course) Carmine Giovinazzo, who plays Danny. It's weird. He sometimes wears strong minusses (mostly in the lab), sometimes planos. How come? He maybe can't wear his contacts in the lab, because of the chemicals. He should wear his minusses all the time 8-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doreen</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2005, 13:16</p><p>Julian- you're right, but even then he should give at least some thought to the choice of frames, shouldn't he. MOst people would. Or they would buy a different pair, if they know they are going to appear in public. Other actors are capable of doing it. However, I think the ones he wore when photographed with Franka Potente weren't that bad.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2005, 06:56</p><p>Mmmm - whoever posted them - those pics of Ioan Gruffudd are gorgeous (8 Oct), especially this one: </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.ioanonline.com/modules.php?set_albumName=album134&amp;id=TGGEP_1&amp;op=modload&amp;file=index&amp;name=gallery&amp;include=view_photo.php" target="_blank">http://www.ioanonline.com/modules.php?set_albumName=album134&amp;id;=TGGEP_1&amp;op;=modload&amp;file;=index&amp;name;=gallery&amp;include;=view_photo.php</a> </p><p> </p><p>I've never seen him in glasses, but they look like around -4 in that pic. Strangely there are 11 pages of photos, and the only glasses ones are on the most recent page. On another page there is a poll about his specs - has he just come out? :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b><a href="http://eyescene.net/bbs/real.html" target="_blank">Julian</a></b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2005, 05:35</p><p>The trouble is that Elijah is a contact wearer. I suspect he may have been advised to give his eyes a rest from contacts sometimes, because he's appeared at a couple of premieres recently in his glasses. I also suspect that he hasn't spent much time choosing frames, because he didn't expect to appear in public wearing them. Years ago, when he was just a kid, he was just once photographed in glasses with round wire frames, Rx lower but still clearly minus. These suited him much better (in my opinion anyway) but still looked like a contact wearer's standby specs. There's a shot on a Yahoo group at <a href="http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/guysglasses8/vwp?.dir=/Hawke+and+Bartha&amp;.src=gr&amp;.dnm=Elijah+when+young.jpg&amp;.view=t&amp;.done=http%3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/guysglasses8/lst%3f%26.dir=/Hawke%2band%2bBartha%26.src=gr%26.view=t" target="_blank">http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/guysglasses8/vwp?.dir=/Hawke+and+Bartha&amp;.src=gr&amp;.dnm=Elijah+when+young.jpg&amp;.view=t&amp;.done=http%3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/guysglasses8/lst%3f%26.dir=/Hawke%2band%2bBartha%26.src=gr%26.view=t</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2005, 15:12</p><p>I meant problems wearing contacts all the time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2005, 15:11</p><p>Elijah does have a propensity for choosing the worst possible frames for his face.  I have seen enough pictures of him in glasses to suspect that he has problems wearing them all the time. </p><p> </p><p>I did enjoy seeing those big beautiful blue eyes staring at the blur in front of him.  A shame he has to hide those eyes behind ugly frames to see when he doesn't have contacts in.  He'd look quite nice in glasses with the right frames.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ron</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2005, 12:02</p><p>No one likes Elijah's glasses - and nor do I! Incidentally, I think they're a bit stronger than they look - maybe minus 4? He nearly always wears contacts; those bare-eyed shots must be the first photos for years in which the cameraman was a faceless blur...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doreen</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2005, 07:14</p><p>I think the problem is Elijah's in frames. There must be some which suit him, but he doesn't seem to be able to find them. If he wore the rights specs-I'd consider him really spexy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mattp</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2005, 06:45</p><p>As I've mentioned before, most of the time I think glasses really add to a guy's sex appeal.  But occasionally the reverse is true.  Maybe it's his choice in frames, but Elijah Wood would do well to forego the glasses.  He obviouosly needs lenses to see, but contacts would be a big improvement over his glasses.  What do the rest of you think? Matt</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doreen</b>&nbsp;10 Oct 2005, 13:26</p><p>Found this while surfing: <a href="http://always.ejwsites.net/05TIFF.html" target="_blank">http://always.ejwsites.net/05TIFF.html</a> </p><p>Elijah is wearing glasses in most photos-they were made within a short period-, but not in every picture.

<p><b><a href="http://eyescene.net/bbs/real.html" target="_blank">Julian</a></b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2005, 22:38</p><p>Wayne: yes, that's what I had in mind. I just wondered if one of the whiz-kids who know the formula could confirm it. Course, it might be his contacts that are -5; that's what he wears most of the time tho' he's appeared in specs at two premieres recently (and I wish he'd get some better frames!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian </b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2005, 22:05</p><p>dERA jAMU, </p><p>You should wear those glossees as much as your nose can tolerate the weight of those -32 lenses. </p><p>Love and chester, </p><p>Jules</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2005, 18:54</p><p>Julian -- it made sense to me.  If Elijah's glasses rx is -5, he'd probably need less minus in contacts.  On the other hand the contact equivalent of a +10 glasses lens would be more plus, hence less minus.  Would the combination explain the 2 diopter difference?  Am I making any more sense with this explanation? :-) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b><a href="http://eyescene.net/bbs/real.html" target="_blank">Julian</a></b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2005, 02:46</p><p>Sorry, reading that post again, it's pretty incoherent. I hope somebody can make sense of it ::)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b><a href="http://eyescene.net/bbs/real.html" target="_blank">Julian</a></b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2005, 02:44</p><p>Yes, I wondered about that. But the effect of vertex distance is to increase the effective power of plus lenses, so  that a high hyperope needs stronger contacts than glasses... Can one of the GOC gurus sort this one out; Cactus Jack maybe? I seem to have heard somewhere that Elijah Wood was around -5, and his description of himself as "actually relatively blind" would fit that better than -3. Another thought: have we ever before heard of any comment he's made about his eyesight?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2005, 20:56</p><p>If Elijah Wood needed -10 contacts to offset the +7 glasses (see link in Robin's post), that would make his rx -3.  I've seen pictures of him wearing glasses and they seemed stronger than -3 to me.  ?? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Helen</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2005, 13:33</p><p>Hi Julian, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for the feedback. I agree with what you say about Hayden's specs in Shattered Glass. Must be honest and admit that I only glanced at the interview with Stephen Glass quickly. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2005, 04:13</p><p>The other thing I meant to say was that I also watched the interview with the real Steve Glass, who is an honest-to-goodness myope: not high but unmistakeable; cut-in quite obvious but no power rings.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2005, 20:11</p><p>Helen: I watched the DVD of 'Shattered Glass' with one eye on he story line and the other on Hayden Christensen's specs. They are confusing, aren't they? Most of the time they look like low minus, but occasionally plus - shades of Johnny Depp! I wonder if the cylinder in them is more than either the plus or the minus sphere ('mixed astigmatism') which can give that effect.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2005, 09:45</p><p>Just checked out Ashton Kutcher on Getty Images. In the latest set of pics he isn't wearing the beard, or the glasses, he had at the launch of 'Beauty and the Geek' in May - and I must say he looks pretty good without them! Looking at the earlier batch, he even looks good with the beard but without the glasses. I can only conclude those heavy black frames are the wrong ones for him; I'd love to see him in wire or light plastic - but does he need specs at all, or were those (geek) props for the evening? </p><p>Also, I got round at last to watching the DVD of 'Closer' last night. Jude Law looks great in those rimless specs, but I really do think they're plano.</p><p></p><hr>

Most of the men wear glasses - I think all but the little spiky-haired "Joe" wear glasses at least part-time. </p><p>Many of the women also have glasses, but you usually only see them wearing them when they're studying with the geeks.  Richard's partner Mindy wore her glasses through most of the most recent episode where they went camping. </p><p>Sadly, in the episode in which the women gave the guys makeovers they took the glasses off most of the guys, and most of the guys also didn't wear their glasses when they were trying to get girls' phone numbers in the mall.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tallguy1983</b>&nbsp;28 May 2005, 15:31</p><p>anyone got any pictures of the lovely Dan Levy in specs?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 May 2005, 07:12</p><p>The lovely Ashton Kutcher has me totally confused. The glasses aren't new: he's wearing them, or a pair very like them, in a photo that's been posted on Electra's site (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/electra_the_migfetish_lady/actors.html)" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/electra_the_migfetish_lady/actors.html)</a> for over a year (and I saw it in the February 20/20 Online in a page of pics of celebrities modelling frames). I can't see any Rx to speak of in the photos on Getty Images; but on the other hand why does the guy turn up at a launch wearing such 'in-your-face' specs unless he sees better with them? </p><p>Possibilities: just a fashion statement; he thinks he looks good in glasseswhich he does but then he looks good without them. And why suddenly this week? Or could it be something to doi with the title of the launch: 'Beauty and the Geek'? </p><p>In conclusion, I don't think that beard improves him.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jo</b>&nbsp;26 May 2005, 12:36</p><p>Is there an rx in the glasses Ashton Kutcher is wearing in the latest photos on Getty Images.  If so anybody want to hazard a guess at the prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;19 May 2005, 09:43</p><p>Definitely plus glasses.  Most likely astigmatism.  I'm no expert but I have met minus glasses wearers with little or no astigmatism, but every plus wearer I have met has had astigmatism.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 May 2005, 02:24</p><p>Yeah, he is cute, isn't he? Can't say about the astigmatism but it's clear from all the photos that he wears pretty strong plus lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rob</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2005, 03:00</p><p>As a hopeless OO, I think this is a great conversation - but can you IMAGINE Johnny Depp's bemusement if he stumbled across it by accident?</p><p></p><hr>

I've read all the comments, studied all the pictures, considered everything...........I have no idea. I submit. I am defeated. The one thing I'm absolutely certain of, and that the reason he wears them as MUCH as he does is out of choice. What I must say is that I'm extremely grateful to Deppendant for all her efforts in putting up those pictures, especially the little set from Jump Street where he puts his glasses on briefly just to see something across the room. Be still my beating heart. I would love buy the video and watch it a thousand times or so, and if Deppendant could identify the precise videotape (episode #, set whatever) for me? And if anyone who works for an optometrist that Johnny has ever visited reads this, please put us out of our misery..................  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2005, 08:19</p><p>Julian - you are right.. apparently his squiffiness is caused by the fact that his 'extreme myopia' is uncorrected in his films - he can't wear contacts.

<p><b>Depp detective</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2005, 02:35</p><p>My verdict: Johnny has a mild Rx for astigmatism incorporating some minus and maybe a bit of plus, and the balance may have shifted over the years. But it's so weak that I'm surprised he couldn't read a teleprompter without them. He could drive legally without those specs in any state in the Union. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>deppendent</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2005, 19:47</p><p>Julian yes Im having fun, but Im working awfully hard for it. I am proud to claim a partial victory in your eyes (pun intended), but now Im now forced to go back to the photo archives. I wish the Oscar pics had posted better, in the original footage there is virtually no distortion. I know how little weight my word has with this group, so I'll say no more. Heres a bone for you, I do think there is some astigmatism, but not primary.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2005, 08:07</p><p>Get a pair of plano lenses and shoot them from the side and many will produce a similar effect.  I've seen it many times.  I am not convinced that there's a true Rx there at all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2005, 02:47</p><p>Thanks for those links, deppendent. OK, the 'Secret Window' shots convince me that those are not plus lenses. However, the distortion I can see doesn't look like true minification (like we got in 'The Ninth Gate'). More like astigmatic distortionminification along the horizontal axis which *is* certainly minus, but not the vertical. </p><p>Isn't this fun? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-oo-</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2005, 09:10</p><p>I vote for astigmatism - in fact thats what I always thought. Also, as I recall from my youth, it seemed like there were people who wore what looked like weak minus glasses all thru school, and then meeting up with them a few years after college, they would be wearing plus. I wonder if it was the custom back in the 60 &amp; 70s not to prescribe the plus part of the prescrption for young hyperopic astigmats without diplopia (eye crossing) in an effort to allow as much emmitropisation (allowing the eye to grow out of hyperopia) as possible.  </p><p> </p><p>See - I was noticing this stuff even then!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2005, 08:43</p><p>There's a thought, Katy, But after reading the recent posts and looking at the photos I'm wondering about the other wild card: ASTIGMATISM. A lens with more cylinder  than spher in it can look plus at one distance and minus at another.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>deppendent</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2005, 00:15</p><p>Hi all a little Johnny controversy is nice, isnt it. OK, lets go back to 1987. I have put up a few pages from 21 Jump Street days.

<p><b>deppendent</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2005, 10:03</p><p>Furtive The Polanski quote is pretty strong evidence. I admit. I'm surprised Ive never seen it. Was it a translation or an English language interview? It does explains why the two pairs of glasses he wears in the film dont seem to be the same prescription the tortoise shell frames seem to have a pretty high minus (the part of the movie they shot first) and the round frames are still minus but not as high. Even someone with a low minus prescription would have had a hard time wearing those tortoise shell glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>I did find photos of him wearing sunglasses on the Ninth Gate set that still appear to be a minus prescription. These glasses turn up in many succeeding photos over the next year or two. I always thought the he hid his prescription behind dark glasses when he wasnt wearing contacts. He was pretty shy about wearing clear-lensed glasses for a lot of years. </p><p> </p><p>Patience my children I will post all my photos later today. The photos I found from 21 Jump Street (shot in 1986, yep, 19 years ago) show lenses that are a definite minus, but a fairly light prescription. He also wore the same glasses off-camera during the filming of Platoon and in about a dozen succeeding episodes of Jump Street. Always did wonder how his eyes got so bad so quickly when a saw the Ninth Gate. </p><p> </p><p>Will include some Oscar shots in my next post. Still holding out that the underlying problem is still myopia with age-related (sorry Johnny) plus correction.  </p><p> </p><p>P.S. Unless one of us speaks Italian and has the article I think we will have to call the Vanity Fair quote a moot point. (However, a French article I saw used myopie.) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Furtive</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2005, 21:17</p><p>In the Vanity Fair article what he actually said when asked whether the glasses were a or whether he was nearsighted or whether wearing glasses was a "habit" was: Both. I have very mild short-sightedness and I hope they give me a more intelligent look. Only kidding, I like eyeglasses, I practically have a collection of them.  </p><p>I think that's pretty much an admission of being one of us - an OO.  And if that's the case there could be all sorts of explanations as to which type of glasses he wore when and why... They could be minus one day, plus the next...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2005, 20:55</p><p>I saw him on the tonight show and he was wearing those horn rims. They were absolutely plus lenses. No question.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Furtive</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2005, 20:20</p><p>Here's an interesting quote re: Johnny Depp: </p><p> </p><p>"Acting is very easy for Johnny. You never see him rehearse his lines. He comes to the set very relaxed and fulfills his task. This was very stimulating. He was interested in old books in any case. He read some of them before the shooting. After that he just put on his costume. I asked him all the time: 'What do you think of this? If you think it's good, I think that too,' was his laconic reply. Concerning his glasses, I explained to him that I wanted him to wear real glasses, because they give a person a different kind of look in the eyes. When he tried them on, he screamed that they made him blind. I insisted on him playing the role like that. Luckily he accepted and for the whole movie he wore glasses through which he actually saw nothing." - Roman Polanski </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>deppendent</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2005, 08:46</p><p>Hi all I love it. A stimulating discussion.  I do believe that Johnny does have some plus correction going on now, but I believe that the lenses are yikesblended bifocal (he is almost 42). </p><p> </p><p>I did find some clear minus lenses from the 1980s, Im working on the post.  </p><p> </p><p>I think that the Ninth Gate seems like an anomaly because he wore contacts pretty much exclusively from 1994 to 2003. You can certainly see very obvious edges of them in almost every still picture and at some point in every movie. I even think Nick of Time is GOC. </p><p> </p><p>The bifocals also explain the sudden transition from contacts to glasses (except on the set). If youre happy in contacts, your close vision starts to go and cant adjust to monovision like I said in my first post, your options are limited.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2005, 02:54</p><p>deppendent: Right, I can't wait. I had an email last night from Electra, who for some inscrutable reason can't post here. She agrees that you make some significant points, but in the end agrees with me that the jury is still out. More observations of my own: </p><p>1. I still think myopic, short-sighted and near-sighted are used loosely as generic terms. And by the way, Electra reminds me that the interview you quoted before had been translated from English into Italian and back! </p><p>2. Although as I mentioned yesterday I'm hyperopic, I also might have more trouble with a teleprompter if it was too far away as it would need better visual acuity. </p><p>3. In 'The Ninth Gate' Johnny wears unmistakeable minus specs. If that was his prescription there would be nothing to discuss because he'd be wearing the same everywhere. But he isn't. (Quite nice if he did - those looked good!) </p><p>I'll be delighted if you can produce anything conclusive. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>deppendent</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2005, 00:38</p><p>Julian I do love a challenge and I think that I am up to it, but I will have to search my archives for the evidence.  </p><p> </p><p>1.	I came across a French fanzine called Lundi dating back to the 21 Jump Street period, with an article titled 10 Things You Dont Know about Johnny Depp.. Number one was: il souffre le myopie.  </p><p> </p><p>2.	When Johnny has commented about trouble seeing, it has always been about distant objects. The exact Oscar quote from Johnny to the producers was Ill do this but Im not going to say all that stuff. I cant even read the Teleprompter, its too far away. The famous Playboy quote was about being able to visually process a room full of 250 naked women (scene from Don Juan de Marco). Johnnys quote was I have one bad eye, so there go 125 right there. Id say I can deal with something in the 30s.  </p><p> </p><p>3.	I have to go back to the Ninth Gate there are quite a few pictures of Johnny on-set, but off cameralaughing with the crew, chatting with the cast, watching the video playback with Polanski etc. Hes still wearing the glasses. If they were in any way wrong, he would have taken them off the minute cameras stopped rolling. GOC I dont think so, but Nick of Time, yes. </p><p> </p><p>4.	Ill post some photos in a day or two. I think I can pull a screen capture from Oscar red carpet footage this year you may find compelling. Also, I remember a shot from Secret Window where the rings were evident and I know I can find something from 21 Jump Street.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2005, 05:57</p><p>deppendent: I'm not entirely convinced by all you say about Johnny's eyesight. Your marshal your arguments well, but they aren't conclusive. </p><p>1. He wore glasses a a kid...if they were for myopia I'd expect obvious cut-in and power rings by now. </p><p>2. In my experience lots of people use 'near-sighted' as a generic term for not seeing well. (I remember one friend of mine saying, "Sorry, I can't read that; I'm short-sightedwell actually I'm long-sighted.") </p><p>3. The glasses he wears in 'The Ninth Gate' are unmistakeably minus - but show me another picture of him where the lenses reveal that...if Roman Polanski wanted a myopic character perhaps he did GOC. </p><p>4. In the shots I have of the 2004 BAFTAs his lenses look low plus to me. And in the shots I've seen from 'The Secret Window' they alos looked plus. </p><p>5. I'm a low hyperope with slight astigmatism - and I'll bet I couldn't read a teleprompter bareyed. </p><p>I think the jury is still out. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>deppendent</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2005, 22:02</p><p>My long time obsession is Johnny Depp, and Electra you have it wrong, Johnny is definitely nearsighted by his own admission. In a 2003 interview with Italian Vanity Fair he responded to whats with the glasses, are you nearsighted? with just a bit. Since you seem to have developed a crush on our boy heres some trivia for you. </p><p>    </p><p>1986 Platoon. A yet-to-be famous Johnny appears in all of the on-set publicity pictures wearing glasses. </p><p>   </p><p>1987-1990 21 Jump Street. Johnny wore his glasses in many of the episodes as an undercover disguise for his cop character. </p><p> </p><p>1993 What Eating Gilbert Grape. Stories from the rural Texas location where the movie was shot was that Johnny would sneak off the set to hit the music clubs in Austin incognito in glasses, of course. </p><p> </p><p>1994 Oscars. Johnny and others often recount this famous story about his experience as an Oscar presenter. Johnny showed up for rehearsal and discovered that the teleprompter was too far away for him to read the copy. Instead of wearing his glasses, he asked the writers to shorten his introduction to a few words. Shortly after the Oscars incident, he started wearing contact lenses on and off the set, and seemed to remain a happy wearer for several years. </p><p> </p><p>1998 The Ninth Gate thats an interesting one. Electra, I dont know where you read the glasses were a prop Polanski made Johnny wear for realism. Polanski did talk about liking Johnny in glasses because they fit the character and helped age him. But I cant imagine a director compromising a performance by asking an actor who needs prescription glasses to wear prescription glasses, just not his own, and not in one scene, but the whole movie. I also cant image studio execs allowing a star who effectively cant see risk injury by running down steps in the dark and driving a speeding car. Shutting down production, even for a day, would have cost many thousands of dollars. I think the specs were the real deal. </p><p>  </p><p>2003. Johnny turns 40 and starts wearing glasses off-set again. Coincidence? I think not. When youre nearsighted, correcting distance vision starts messing up your close vision in your late thirties. If you want to see both near and far, your options start to suck. I think thats whats going on with him.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

They're a real prescription for once.  </p><p>David </p><p> </p><p>CSI Files: Fans have taken note of Danny's new glasses, which he didn't wear in the CSI: Miami episode ("MIA/NYC--NonStop") that introduced the NY cast. Why the change?  </p><p> </p><p>Giovinazzo: That was part of the character. We're creating a character and I think [the addition of the glasses] worked out for the best. They might come off at some point. I've kind of gotten used to them. Once [I] put those on, you know who this guy is. It's not me, although I do wear glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>CSI Files: Did that have anything do with the addition of the glasses?  </p><p> </p><p>Giovinazzo: No, no, it was completely a decision that was made as we were beginning to do the show. [Though i]f I took them off, I couldn't see things. I'm blind without them.  </p><p> </p><p>CSI Files: It sounds like it was a good addition then.  </p><p> </p><p>Giovinazzo: It's nice. I don't have to do [the show] with my contacts on all the time. I can let my eyes breathe. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Anyway, will post any thoughts and comments here. </p><p> </p><p>Watched "The Sum of All Fears" again the other evening and thought that I could spot myself at last. So, took DVD to play on my PC and looked at the scene again. Unfortunately, I could not find the exact spot even after two or three times of looking. However, I am convinced that I could see contacts in Ben's eyes. Maybe I am beginning to see things that are not there. </p><p> </p><p>It has been too quiet on the Ben front lately. If I do by some miracle 'bump' into him in Boston, I feel the need to ask him about his eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Enjoy your day.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2004, 04:17</p><p>To be honest Jules, I can never find groups at Yahoo even while they are still live. The groups search engine is possibly the worst search I've ever come across. Unless you have the actual link, it's usually hopeless. I seem to have it in for Yahoo this week don't I! I'd like to complain about the "new Chat" they've got set up like a ship too, but this in not the place!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>A Lurker</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2004, 00:06</p><p>A couple of young actors regularly spotted in frames on places such as Getty Images.  Firstly, Martin Spanjers (although his last pic is under Mark Spanjers!) from 8 Simple Rules.  He seems to wear glasses (or prescription shades) for most of his appearances.  The other is Drake Bell from Nick's "Drake and Josh" show.  He's photographed several times wearing black plastic frames, not the kind of glasses for those shy about their specs! He's not always wearing them, I don't think his rx is that high, there's not too much cut in, but he's definately squinting in some of the shots where he's bare eyed. </p><p> </p><p>It's good to see younger stars comfortable with wearing their glasses.  Hopefully it will convince some reluctant teens that specs can enhance their appearance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;24 Aug 2004, 05:12</p><p>Fair enough I suppose; but it would help if they explained a little more instead of just denying that the group exists. I've had this experience before when a group has closed down. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;24 Aug 2004, 05:04</p><p>That was Yahoo, they shut it down from lack of use. The way I see it, if it's that unpopular there's no point shoring it up. I can put exactly the same pictures/information up on my website, which won't be going anywhere!</p><p></p><hr>

They are stronger than my other ones, but not all that strong.

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;14 Aug 2004, 06:50</p><p>In Hollywood terms, actually often in general non-OO terms, "very myopic" can mean anyone who needs their glasses full-time. I've heard plenty of people use the coke bottle reference to low prescriptions too. Go figure. From the photos of James Dean in glasses that I've seen, they were no higher than -3.00. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LongTimeLurker</b>&nbsp;14 Aug 2004, 06:20</p><p>Not sure if this has ever come up before, but James Dean is said to have been VERY myopic (although in Hollywood terms, I'm not sure what that means...). But his driver's licence DID require that he wear corrective lenses, and there are a number of references to "coke bottle eyeglasses" from people who were on the sets of his 2/3 movies. </p><p> </p><p>Anybody know any more?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>An Actor</b>&nbsp;13 Aug 2004, 08:40</p><p>I'm one of the names mentioned way down in the thread and if it's OK with everyone here I'd like to speak up for those of us who don't always have the final say in how we look.  </p><p> </p><p>When you make your living dressing up as other people you have to do what the director and wardrobe people tell you to do. Sometimes that includes wearing glasses. For technical reasons usually they want you to wear prop glasses they have control over. Sometimes they let you wear your own glasses. Depends on time, budget, and other issues. But it's not unusual for an actor who has arrived on set in contacts to be told to wear prop glasses. We don't get a choice usually. Only the big names like Depp get to do that. </p><p> </p><p>But thanks for noticing. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2004, 07:48</p><p>Filthy weather yesterday, so I went to the cinema to see 'SpiderMan 2'...I really need to refresh my memory about the plot of the previous film (I have the video at home). </p><p>I guess most people have seen this. I was fascinated by the period when Peter (Tobey Maguire) gave up being SpiderMan, tripped over a step, fished his glasses out and put them on, after a quick blurry shot of the scene as he allegedly saw it without them. For my money Tobey Maguire looks good in glasses (but then for my money so does any guy you name!) but why, oh why do they put him in planos when he's naturally a minus 4 or thereabouts? When he resumed SpiderMan activity there was another blurry shot which cleared miraculously, then he crushed the specs in his hand, dropped them on the ground and one lens fell out. </p><p>Sadly, the lovely James Franco (Harry) was a much less sympathetic charater thanI remember. Worse, he never once appeared in the sexy round wire specs he wore at his desk in the first film. </p><p>Must watch that again! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>zoomey</b>&nbsp;16 Jul 2004, 05:35</p><p>It's pretty obvious that they are plus lenses if you zoom in on the pic. The last one is most apparent) An easy way to do this is (on ie) is to select print preview, and then - in the drop down menu where you see 75% - select 200% or 500% (you'll probably need to scoll over and down to the picture content)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Jul 2004, 03:31</p><p>Odd one, that. Where I can see any image through the lenses it looks like minification, but the whole appearance suggests strong plus. I wonder if maybe there's a whole lot of cylinder in those lenses. In any case I'd see he needs that correction pretty badly and has to wear contacts or specs full time.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2004, 02:01</p><p>Pity, isn't it? They make a film where glasses are a character's trade mark, and cast somebody who doesn't actually need them...there must be plenty of young actors around with bad eyesight. I've got no complaints about Daniel Radcliffe, but just suppose they'd been making the series ten years ago when Elijah Wood was the right age to play Harry Potter! </p><p>But of course, what you say about light reflection is probably the reason Tobey Maguire doesn't often wear his real prescription on set. </p><p>By the way are you the Furtive who was posting sometime last year about struggling to 'come out' as a glasses wearer? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Furtive</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2004, 19:17</p><p>I saw a TV show about the making of the Harry Potter movies.  It had interviews with the cast, including Daniel Radcliffe.  He showed the interviewer that the particular set of Harry Potter frames that he was wearing in the interview actually had no lenses in them at all (he stuck his finger through them to demonstrate.)  He said that there are multiple pair of glasses and that the lense-less ones are used whenever the glare of the lights would be a problem, whereas those with lenses are used for close-ups in which it would be more apparent if there were no lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2004, 05:35</p><p>Saw the new Harry Potter film last night. I notice:  </p><p>1. Daniel Radcliffe, who started the series as an uninterestingly pretty little boy, is on the way to being a very handsome young man - when he's old enough to notice that is. But I hear rumours that he is growing up too fast for the series to keep up with him ::( </p><p>2. The glasses he was wearing didn't look quite plano to me; I thought there was some distortion that suggested a weak plus lens. In one scene his glasses we knocked off (in a struggle with the whomping willow) and we were given an impression of what he saw bareyed - all quite blurry. </p><p>3. There was a trailer of Spiderman II with several shots of Tobey Maguire in black plastic frames - but certainly not the -4 lenses he is said to need. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;13 May 2004, 09:18</p><p>I was forbidden access to Matthew! </p><p> </p><p>Yes, that's a nice shot of Johnny, although I didn't like his hair like that really, too conservative, too "preppy". JD's appeal lies in his wonderfully rebellious sense of style, but the man is so damn hot he doesn't ever look bad no matter what he does - with one exception. This may shock you. You really don't want to see him squint, odd, but there it is. On most guys it's sexy but the hottest man on Earth's face folds up like a camp chair when he squints. Weird huh?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;02 May 2004, 01:25</p><p>Hi Electra: I was just wondering what would you say about adding Dr. Drew to your celeb site?  He's verrry handsome, intelligent,and he has the sexiest voice. What about Howie Long?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;01 May 2004, 04:55</p><p>Oh yes, a moderate minus, but I thought you guys wanted the exact Rx? I've sent an e-mail to a buddy who lives near the museum in Liverpool where there's a pair on display with full details. We talked about this some years ago and he was going to go check for me then, never got around to it, but hopefully this time he will.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2004, 20:54</p><p>Electra, another Rx question.  In one of the Beatle's old TV clips, one is holding his glasses as though he will put them on soon and can't see much without them, perhaps a moderate minus?Any idea of the Rx?  Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2004, 12:42</p><p>Actually I can get that exact information for you if you'll give me a few days.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2004, 09:40</p><p>Gosh, Electra! I had no luck with Getty images, but tried Rex Features - only thumbnails these days ::( - but Ewan is wearing glasses in 28 of the 30 newest shots, with his kilt in 19 of them! These are not the frames we used to see; and in several full face shots his eyes seem to be magnified - strongish plus lenses in other words, and pretty frequent if not constant wear. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2004, 09:15</p><p>Electra...he is barely a man yet, but Macaulay Culkin is wearing glasses in a photo in this month's issue of Instinct Magazine, a gay men's mag.

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2004, 15:57</p><p>So. I've started putting up the new version of my celebrities area, and it has been beta tested by my trusted inner circle. Now, when you click on the celebs page you get a choice of actors, musicians, lost to LASIK, and "Please God". Only the Actors page has much on it yet, but I'm working on it all the time. These pages have thumbnails of those beautiful men in glasses, and gradually each man, assuming I have more than one photo, will have a whole page dedicated to his eyeswear and associated....stuff. Because I'm so nice I am now including men that do do much for me personally, because who else other than good ol' Electra is going to do this for you? In return you are all going to send me pics for the site, aren't you? I still need some that are supposedly easy to find but I sure as hell can't find find them. I've had 5 people tell me they've seen Mel Gibson in glasses in magazines, so will one of you please dig deeply, thank you! </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/electra_the_migfetish_lady" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/electra_the_migfetish_lady</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2004, 14:02</p><p>Just go to Getty images and type in "Ewan Mcgregor glasses" and the kilt comes free!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2004, 13:21</p><p>Ewan looks good in his glasses (of course!) even if they are a bit National health looking. He also looks really good in his MacGregor tartan kilt.

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2004, 12:59</p><p>When I started my site I only put up men that I personally thought were really hot, then I included some "sos-so, but look good in glasses" because proves my point. Then I got begged to include some that I thought were quite plain, and eventually got goaded into "by request" pics. The thing is, my site is becoming really popular and I am trying to please.  I think I reached the bottom of the barrel agreeing to put up Clay Aiken. I have other objections to Marc Anthony, but, no he's not my type at all. But glasses is glasses, you know.......sometimes you just have to swallow hard.  </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, on the new celebs page I'll give them all a score and put some sort of symbol up next to my favorites!</p><p></p><hr>

March 12 NYT, full page add for new Johnny Depp movie, glasses do not show minus rings but are somewhat thick, extending beyond frame at front and back.  In review, same NYT, a photo from the film wearing glasses which do not show any strength.  Is he wearing contacts for the film?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2004, 06:49</p><p>Can't think which thread to post this in, but I'm hoping those of you who read this will know what the hell I'm talking about. </p><p> </p><p>OK, some time ago someone here, somewhere told me that all I needed to watch DVD's on my computer was a DVD-ROM drive. I bought one. My boyfriend installed it competantly for me. I can watch movies on my computer just fine. They look great.  </p><p> </p><p>BUT......... </p><p> </p><p>I can't do screen captures. And that was what I wanted it for. To grab pics off the movies of characters in glasses to put up on my site. It doesn't work. Here's what happens. </p><p> </p><p>I pause the movie at the right place. I hit "Print Screen". Then I paste that as a new image into Paint Shop Pro. I save it any which way (I've tried .psp, .jpg, .bmp) and if I open it again right there and then (movie still running) I see what I saved. BUT. If I close the movie and open the saved image, all I get is a picture of the blue viewer frame with the controls at the bottom, and a BLACK screen!  </p><p> </p><p>What step did I miss?

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2004, 08:39</p><p>Yeah, William Petersen used to be quite nice to watch, years ago, but he hasn't matured the way I like them to.

<p><b>Kix</b>&nbsp;29 Feb 2004, 19:03</p><p>I tried looking for pictures of George Eads wearing glasses online-no luck. But there are load of pictures of his CSI co-star William Pedersen wearing glasses online-I think they are low plus. He doesn't do as much for me(he's a little on the, well, mature side for me) but he does have a kind of sex appeal and I love that you can count on him regularly wearing glasses on the show. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sis</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2004, 16:35</p><p>Hi! </p><p>I've also seen George Eads in CSI and in the movie you mentioned. The glasses in the movie and the sunglasses he is wearing in CSI look like a low pluss - I think.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2004, 15:21</p><p>"Just a Walk in the Park"....I'll ivestigate, yes, he's cute.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kix</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2004, 09:41</p><p>Electra,  </p><p> </p><p>I'm glad you liked the In Style picutres. Another actor who I am curious about is George Eads from CSI. He was in a tv movie last year where he wore glasses though they may have been plano but I have also seen shots of him at awards shows and publicity events for CSI where he was wearing tinted shades that looked to have a low - perscription. He's kind of a cutie anyway. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2004, 05:53</p><p>By the way, I got In Style and I'm drooling over it as I type. The good news for Ben fans is that I've amassed quite a collection of pics of him in glasses now, some are up at the Yahoo group attached to me site, others will be going up on the site itself with the celeb page revamp.

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2004, 05:51</p><p>As usual, I had to go look him up.......yes, he has very interesting eyes! He can most certainly go on the Please God list.

<p><b>Kix</b>&nbsp;21 Feb 2004, 09:20</p><p>Electra </p><p>It's the US version of the magazine and the Kyle picture is in a story about the Sundance Film Festival and the Ben picture is is an article about Oscar winners. If it's not on the website yet, I know the magazine was on newsstands as of Wednesday this week at least in the US. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;21 Feb 2004, 01:27</p><p>Kix: I checked the website and there appear to be several editions of In Style, which country did you obtain it in? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kix</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2004, 22:35</p><p>A couple of things in this month's In Style magazine (with Uma Thurman on the cover). The first is a small picture of Kyle MacLachlan wearing oval wire rims and making going gray look downright sexy (page 338). The second is more of a non-sighting, Ben Afflect with his black rimmed glasses on the table next to him (page 436). I don't know if either of the pictures is accessible on the magazine's website but worth flipping to-especially the one of MacLachlan-if you happen to see the magazine.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MVIII</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2004, 06:04</p><p>I agree with Electra, her male characters are sensitive, in a positive way.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Quizgrl2</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2004, 02:20</p><p>Electra, i've just read Jewels. All i can say is WOW! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2004, 22:34</p><p>But what I ought to have added is that that is no kind of criticism: I love all the stories and eagerly await further instalments! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2004, 22:32</p><p>Sensitive? wimpy? It's a delicate distinction. &lt;g&gt; Electra you called Scott a wuss in the text, and I guess that's not all that different from a wimp, and Josh is pretty wimpy too. Dean? Well... The delicious Italian waiter we can't comment on yet. Nathan definitely not, nor Tony. And Ten is just gorgeous, given the slightest enouragement I'd bed him like a shot ::) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mnyclip</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2004, 15:32</p><p>Electra </p><p>yes. I am male. I hope you didn't take ofense to my observation. I understand these are sensitive male characters that are geared toward women.  I was just wondring.  so I will shutup about  this matter now.  Hale to The queen, you are amazing</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sis</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2004, 14:41</p><p>Hey Electra! </p><p>The ninth gate was on norwegian tv tonight, Jonny Depp at his best - glasses and all. - I think I've seen it five times - never tired.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2004, 11:44</p><p>Here's a thought, are YOU male or female? That might make a difference on how you see it. See, there was me thinking they were sensitive in a good way. Hmm. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2004, 11:43</p><p>Well, I guess that's what you get from a woman trying to write about men......and, I ought to say, I tend to use characters, well, personalities anyway, from men I've known (and loved). Maybe I go for wimpy men. That demands consideration!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mnyclip</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2004, 11:42</p><p>Electra </p><p> </p><p>I just read Melting Sand and Late One Night.  They both are very promising. Melting Sand the male character seems to be stronger in his demeanor than your other male charaters. To answer your question, yes, I think most of the male characters are wimpy.  Looking forward to the next installments.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2004, 05:02</p><p>Thank you, and that's interesting. Wimpy huh? Do you think they all are or just some of them? I value constructive criticism so I'll certainly take that into consideration.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mnyclip</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2004, 15:34</p><p>Electra, </p><p>Just visited your site and loved it.  EyeScene should put yours up as a direct link.  It's one of the best out there . Love the fact that you are asking others for input and help. Only question is re: your stories.  they are wonderful and I know you are catering to the female perspective, but why are the guys so wimpy???  It's like they're in a parent child relationship.  Don't get me wrong, like i said i really enjoy them just wondering. Keep up the good work</p><p></p><hr>

Pics found and I'll put him up forthwith. </p><p> </p><p>David has "those eyes" which add fuel to my theory as to why so many handsome men wear glasses. Basically it goes like this: It's not exactly a coincidence that we find so many gorgeous men in glasses - more that  the eye shape that women find most attractive also happens to be prone to eye problems. It's not exactly cause and effect either, it's parallel. I've tested this theory out so many times, and I'm hardly ever wrong.  </p><p> </p><p>I found the pic I needed for Adam too and will put him up, even though he has huge ears. Why is his face so familiar.......</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2004, 14:53</p><p>Not familiar with either guy, but I'll look them up, thanks!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jeffy</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2004, 19:49</p><p>The Chandler character on Friends got glasses three seasons ago - in the season right after he and Monica got engaged.  Since then he's worn glasses in almost all episodes, but only in about half his scenes in each.   </p><p>In the episode where he gets glasses he expects the other friends to comment on them, but they all think he's worn glasses all along. </p><p>There was also one 2-part episode a couple seasons prior to that where he wore glasses.  It was about what would have happened if each of the friends had made different decsions in their lives. In it he was Joey's personal assistant and an aspiring comic book wrtier, and was much more nerdy.  Apparently that version of his life would have meant he'd have needed glasses earlier? </p><p> </p><p>As you can probably tell, I'm a huge fan of Matthew Perry in glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

Ah, that's more like it! he wore glasses in Minority report and some here claim they were genuine. I've not been able to find any pictures. </p><p> </p><p>Ewan McGregor? Easy! He even said "I wear reading glasses" in an interview. Wonderful smile...&lt;slap&gt;.....oh, yes here we go: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/media/mcgregor.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/media/mcgregor.jpg</a> </p><p> </p><p>Adam Garcia? I had to look this one up too, not bad I suppose, big ears. Not really my type. I looked for pictures for you, no luck. </p><p> </p><p>Robert Downey, Jr? Not usually all that appealing to me, don't know why, but this photo is lovely: <a href="http://img.yupimsn.com/canales/entretenimiento/temas/cumpleanos/robert-downey-jr.jpg" target="_blank">http://img.yupimsn.com/canales/entretenimiento/temas/cumpleanos/robert-downey-jr.jpg</a> </p><p> </p><p>Elijah Wood?

If I find anything I'll share. I obsess over the few photos I have of him, but there are none available it seems, of him in glasses. Now then, I'll buy the DVD when it comes out, does anyone know how to get screen captures? Do I need to buy a special video card (and/or other stuff?) for my computer, play it on my CD-ROM drive etc to do it? I'm willing.  </p><p> </p><p>The good thing is, he's young, and therefore will improve with age.......I hope his career blooms. </p><p> </p><p>(swoon)</p><p></p><hr>

I mean the man is divine, you must love him as much as I do....say yes, say yes...... </p><p> </p><p>There's some numbnuts on other threads having a go at Gays, well, for the record, Jules and me have the same tastes in men quite often, and that suits me FINE, because we'll share:) Me and Jules will buy a nice flat in the Tottenham Court Road and grab us some love slaves. He can have the gay ones and I'll have the straight ones. Until we get them drunk then we'll swap:) Hey, it could work!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>kevin</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2003, 01:58</p><p>can anyone name all the actors in coronation street that wear glasses on and off screen</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2003, 14:52</p><p>Interesting (for UK viewers) that Dev in Coronation Street has been wearing his own prescription glasses in the last couple of episodes - noticable minus. </p><p>Interesting inasmuch that in the storyline he wears the glasses specifically to attract and impress a potential girlfriend. A refreshing change from the cliched line we normally get in films etc where its the exact opposite ie its the ditching of glasses that gets the result ! </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

Well worth seeing, nothing to offend even an old queen like me. Before the big picture came on, though, there was a trailer for another film, I didn't get the name, by the makers of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' &amp;c.; The cast included Hugh Grant - and the trailer showed lots of sexy spexy guys.

<p><b>bif</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2003, 19:48</p><p>I read an interview awhile back - I can't remember which actor - in which the actor talked about having difficulty with contacts and glasses in a movie that he was in.  He stated that he had to wear contacts to "offset" his vision because in real life he has perfect vision but it was very important to the director that he wear real glasses and that he USE the glasses in the movie. So:  at least in some cases, just because you see prescription glasses onscreen doesn't mean the actor wears glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2003, 22:23</p><p>DNB, I didn't see him on Letterman, but when I have seen him in person, he appears to be somewhat farsighted and have astigmatism.

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2003, 22:15</p><p>OK, Richard Gere appeared on the David Letterman show tonight and wore the glasses he's had for the past few years. It appears he may have an astigmatism, definitely trifocals, but what are other's impressions? </p><p> </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2002, 07:01</p><p>Hey, obsessed, nobody's answered your query about Ryan Phillippe [I guess everybody thought somebody else would ::) ] Ryan is quite often photgraphed wearing glasses off set, sometimes black plastic and sometimes wire frames. My guess is that he has hyperopia and/or astigmatism; in 'Cruel Intentions' he seems to use glasses much the way I did at his age/the age of the character he plays - on to read something and then they stay on for a while. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2002, 04:55</p><p>It's ages since I've seen Jaws - but they decided to dust off the old movie and show it on Christmas Day. I'd quite forgotten how well glasses featured in that movie. Two out of the three guys on the fishing boat Orca wore them - those guys also being the two surviving actors - the other one being eaten by the shark for Christmas dinner! Of course - they both lost their specs before the boat finally sank. They were real specs with appreciable distortion - and cunningly used in some takes. When one guy is reading up about sharks - the pages of the book are deliberately reflected in his glasses. Also - when he goes out to sea - his wife reminds him that she's packed a spare pair of glasses. Earlier than that - there's a woman whose son is eaten by the shark - and she's obviously quite myopic by the look of her glasses. Which all goes to show the moviemakers that there isn't really any excuse to be using planos and fake spex in qualtiy movies!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>obsessed</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2002, 15:06</p><p>Sorry, I'm new to this, and maybe you get this question all the time - but I have to ask anyway: does anyone know what kind of sunglasses Ryan Phillipe wears in Cruel Intentions?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>chillin</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2002, 12:30</p><p>I just saw a movie last night called "Drumline" which has some good glasses moments. The actor Orlando Jones, the guy in the 7-up commercials, wears some strong minus glasses when he is at his desk and using his computer. This seems to be the only time he is nearsighted, though. There are other people in the movie who wear glasses, but not as prominent as Orlando Jones.  </p><p>On a side note, the movie was pretty good. Much better than most teen movies. The story line is predictable, but the drumming is really cool. You will come out wanting to be a drummer.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;11 Dec 2002, 22:31</p><p>Ok, I watch TV on occasion. There was a really good episode of "The West Wing" on tonight with GLASSES present.  </p><p> </p><p>Toby's father at the beginnig was wearing great minus glasses from the eighties, except it was supposed to be 1954. Actually there were three glasses wearers in the scene that took place in 1954 in Brooklyn in Yiddish, and guess what, we shouldn't complain. </p><p> </p><p>The father appeared again (as a significantly older man)in the present with much less obvious minus glasses. Boring, from a glasses point of view, but the episode was otherwise good.</p><p></p><hr>

I think he wore his own glasses for this and they were big and thick 19080's style with lots of rings. He used them in strange ways in the movie, though, taking them on and off at inappropriate times.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Musey</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2002, 11:51</p><p>Humor me....one more movie thing. Does anyone know if Lionel Barrymore was myopic? I recently saw a really trippy sci-fi (loosley based on Jules Verne story)called The Mysterious Planet, a semi-silent starring my hero, Lionel. His hair was really cool in this one, hanging over his forehead. But boy, did he ever squint a lot! Not sure if he did that to appear more like a scientist, or whether that was out of poor eyesight. I don't think I've ever seen publicity shots of him with glasses, though as an older man he wore them in some films.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Musey</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2002, 11:45</p><p>Ohh, this is where everyone is....btw, does anyone know if Jeremy Irons has an eye problem? He sure wore pluses in Stealing Beauty.  </p><p>I don't see a movies topic, but I recently saw The Great Escape (hadn't seen that in a while) and remember the Englishman who said his eyesight was geting worse and worse, and called it progressive myopia? He said he could see close-up, and held his hand right in front of his eyes, but said he couldnt see anything beyond that. It was a tantalizing addition to the story, made the escapees human, like Charles Bronsen had claustrophobia. Great film!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2002, 13:38</p><p>Yeah, Freddie has worn glasses on and off for years, and if you look around on the net it's quite possible to find the occasional older photo of him in glasses. But as Julian says in virtually all the shots taken of him over the past year he's been wearing glasses in public appearances, on tv interviews and the more private shots (and when he hasn't he's squinting real bad).  I guess his eyes have got more dependent on the glasses so he has to wear them vitrually full time these days (not surprising if the RX is in the region that's suggested).  He certainly looks a lot better wearing glasses than he does squinting into the blur in the distance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cordell</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2002, 10:04</p><p>I got FPJrs's eyeglass prescription from a bio I read about him. He said he is "blind without them" and has no problem wearing glasses in public. He also said he started wearing glasses when he was 10.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2002, 04:00</p><p>I've noticed before (and mentioned here before) that Freddie Prinze Jr didn't squint on set, but on interviews about films he often did. My conclusion was that he wore contacts for filming but in the interviews was bareyed and having trouble seeing. And of course in 'Boys and Girls' he wore glasses with a definite minus Rx. If that Rx that's quoted is right (but how does anybody know?) he could certainly do with correction full time. He's had glasses for years; I have some ancient four-eyed pics of him. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

We were speculating about his Rx on eyescene; someone said they keow Anthony and would ask him, and came back with the answer that he was between -4 and -5. A year or so later I found Rapp's own website, where you can email him. So I did. He was a bit mystified, but wrote back and said, yup, I'm around the -4/5 mark. So there. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2002, 05:03</p><p>Freddie is certainly appearing in his glasses more and more often these day and seems to have become more dependent on them.  The RX doesn't look that high but it looks like he has become a full time wearer (at least when he's in public).  I guess that it is not suprising that he wears his glasses for premiers and award events as (a) he will want to see what is going on and (b)as the press are taking his picture he will look better four-eyed rather than two-eyed and squinting.   </p><p> </p><p>Anybody know what his RX is?

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2002, 13:58</p><p>Another delicious young actor who doesn't feature in the People magazine survey is Ryan Phillippe.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2002, 13:54</p><p>Yes, Matt, Freddie Prinze jr always squints like that, if not worse, these days if he doesn't have his glasses on (unless, presumably, he has contacts in in front of the camera). Ages ago I noticed that in film previews on cable TV he was often squinting in interviews. His Rx isn't high, agreed, but he's obviously short-sighted enough to have trouble without correction, </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Matt</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2002, 11:19</p><p>Re - People Magazine Poll. </p><p> </p><p>Given the photos the have used of Freddie Prinze, I'm not surprised that 74% of people think he looks better in glasses.  In the bare-eyed photo he is really squinting - either he was looking into the sun or he needed to be wearing his glasses.  What do people think?  His RX looks pretty low in the picture of him in glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

Maybe someone on here has mentioned this before, but I just realized (when seeing a photo) that the actor Richard Dreyfuss is not only sometimes photographed wearing glasses, but he is QUITE nearsighted...possibly in the -8 range? I have only seen small photos so it's hard to tell.  He's getting older now but I think was quite handsome in his day.  He obviously performed most of his roles wearing powerful contacts.  </p><p></p><hr>

'The Grass Is Greener' too, is a must-see (scene where 3 men are conducting a duel and the women come upon them, one exclaiming som. like, what is going on, they're all wearing glasses!) and the latest one I've seen again, Carey and Hepburn...can't remember the name but he is a paleantologist....wordy bantering type farce, but at one point he falls and breaks his glasses...unfortunately they quickly make it alright, it seems in this film as in many, they are symbolic of his myopic and stayed...staid...sheesh I cant spell!! lifestyle...the point when the glasses break is about when he begins letting Katherine into his heart and the capricious fun that comes with her. Because he never does get them fixed....WE would have done a rewrite! Anyway the specs have made more of a Carey fan of me. </p><p>Hearty~</p><p></p><hr>

You could've had Gandalf peering over his gold half-rims - Frodo switching between his high minus and reading specs - the Lady of the Wood making a delightful 'clink' with her thick specs when she kisses Frodo. Instead of "Will you look into the mirror" you could have "Will you look into my glasses?" When Frodo says "What will I see?" the Lady could answer "Not much, I'm afraid, coz my glasses are -32 and my magic arts suggest that your own prescription is merely -24!" Maybe I'm asking too much - but wouldn't Lord of the Glasses have been a better spin? Including of course the non-seeing Myopic Eye of Sauron! In any case, the dwarf guy definitely needed a prismatic correction on his right eye.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2002, 02:18</p><p>Kubla, you were asking what it all was about Elijah Wood. Well, he used to be a cute child actor and is now a very handsome young man of 21; so when somebody found a photo of him wearing glasses and reported it on the old Eye Scene BBS all the gay guys around the place went berserk (and the discussion got quite acrimonious). What is especially tantalizing (and titillating too!) is that as far as we can see he has only ever been photographed ONCE in specs. The debate raged about how strong they were, with suggestions from -1 to -5, but nobody at that time suggested they were plus. I have five different shots of him, all apparently taken on the same occasion (same clothes, same background) and I will shortly try to post them on Dominic's 'spexyguys' Yahoo group. </p><p>I think the people who think those are plus lenses are wrong. I think what we see in the pic that Guest points us (My No 1 when I post them) to is minification of the background. Also, in my No 2 I can see a bit of cut-in. Finally I think a comparison with a bare eyed pic (or rather one with contacts) will show that his eyes look smaller through his specs. Apologies to my fellow hyperopes, but I have looked long and lovingly at these photos &lt;grin&gt; and I don't think we can claim him as one of us. As Dom has mentioned, these photos are years old, and Kubla's report suggests his myopia has increased - "he's gotten so blind he even got bifocals for when he doesn't wear contacts". Bifocals are sometimes prescribed for young myopes to try and slow down the progress. I wish, and I'm not alone, that we could see some recent shots of him in his coke bottles. </p><p>Guest: I checked the first URL you gave us for Jeremy London and got a screenful of broken icons; but I think I know the pics you mean. To me it didn't look as if he was short sighted enough to justify LASIK. If anything can. Other actors you might have mentioned are James van der Beek, Brad Pitt and Freddie Prinze jr. Ryan Phillippe is sometimes seen in glasses too, but I suspect astigmatism rather than myopia. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Mine certainly did.  </p><p> </p><p>Last night I watched a terrible old movie - Hair, made in 79, years after the stage show. But there's one good reason to watch it: Treat Williams, gorgeously hunky as the mop-top Berger, and then even cuter when he cuts off his hair to pose as a soldier. Anyway, the point is that, when he steals a jeep, he suddenly dons a pair of military aviator sunglasses. With - you've guessed it - strong minus lenses! Obviously Treat was too blind to drive bare-eyed. And that reminded me of Starsky and Hutch, where David Soul would don a pair of minus sunglasses every time he drove, even in dull weather. They can't fool me, those nearsighted celebrities!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hearty</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2002, 23:16</p><p>Hi Guys, </p><p>I saw a classic movie a couple of weeks ago or so, titled 'Beat the Devil', with Bogart, Gina Lolabrigida (i'm bad with spelling!) Peter Laurie, &amp; Robert Morley. I was doing laundry so it was just on, I didn't really watch it, until...they landed in some foreign country, and the official in charge was a good-looking man with thee thickest specs I've ever seen in movies. They looked real, but I dont know.....of course his character was made fun of, can a thick-lensed actor never be of good character? Anyway, this guy turned me on something awful, I just stared n stared! </p><p>I make notes to myself, I have them all over the house! So I see I wrote down Truman Capote &amp; John Houston, whether they were involved in the writing/making of THIS film I'm not sure.....anyway I highly recommend checking it out....Beat the Devil. It seemed like a good flick, what I saw of it through the wash pile.....8) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2002, 13:34</p><p>I know, Julian, it's just so damned frustrating: only once in the last 10 years has Lij stepped out of the house w/o contacts. Judging by his Rx when he was about 14, he could be in coke bottles by now. Incidentally, the one still from Spiderman that someone posted to Dom's Cute Guys in Glasses suggests that Tobey Maguire wears a healthy minus Rx in the film (as he did in a made for TV movie a few years ago). But the other stills indicate plano. Honestly, life as a lens spotter is so challenging.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2002, 17:17</p><p>Two trips to the cinema in a week - last week it was Harry Potter, today Lord of the Rings! Enthralled - but in some shots I thought Elijah Wood's contact lenses were very obvious! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cooldip</b>&nbsp;10 Dec 2001, 12:14</p><p>In the Spy Game, Redford wore aviator style glasses during the Vietnam war era scenes, and horn rimmed glasses for the 1991 scenes. Both looked like astigmatism lenses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2001, 01:44</p><p>I went to watch "Spy Game" starring Robert Redford and Brad Pitt. I was amazed at how many pairs of glasses were worn in the movie - and the number of time times glasses went on - got taken off - got switched for shades - got put down on the table - held in the hand - etc. I guess glasses aren't entirely written out of movie scripts!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2001, 04:48</p><p>Well I finally went to see the Harry Potter movie and enjoyed it very much. I thought they got a neat pair of specs for Daniel Radcliffe - and in some takes I'd believe they were prescription - while in other takes they seemed plano! His big eyes make it look as if the lenses are plus even if they're plano! I also thought that the glasses worn by some of the older actors - generally readers - for peering over the top of - were inspired! I think they should have given the little witch-girl (Hermione) glasses - though this might have drawn away from Harry Potter's own specs.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2001, 01:24</p><p>Well there must be something that drives her to go on about glasses the way she does - when most other writers barely mention them - if at all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sideling</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2001, 21:11</p><p>Christy, </p><p>   I could have sworn the first time I saw her in an interview she was wearing some.  I can't find any pictures to back that up, though.  I know her partner does.   </p><p>   OO?  I think it's a definite possibility!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2001, 10:05</p><p>There's a pic of Freddie Prinze Jr on Dominic's current Yahoo! club looking absolutely stunning in different glasses from any I've seen him in before.

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2001, 05:31</p><p>Sideling - one day when I get stranded somewhere for a week with nothing to do - I'll make an effort to read all JK Rowling's books. Incidentally - I think she's dead cute - but of course she'd be truly wonderful in glasses! I wonder shy she always goes on about them? Do you think she's OO?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sideling</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2001, 21:04</p><p>Er, not sure if this is the right thread for this, but has anyone noticed the large percentage of characters wearing glasses in JK Rowling's books in general?  She takes great care to describe the glasses each time a new such character is introduced, as well... it's quite an entertaining read (which isn't to say it wouldn't be anyway).  Unfortunately I think at least one character who had them in the books (or at least had them by the third book) didn't in the movie...perhaps they thought she was overdoing it?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hearty</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2001, 14:52</p><p>I just wondered whether Brad Pitt needs glasses, since he wears them in more than one film. I'm not all that crazy over him, but he does get a cute squinty look now and then....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2001, 16:08</p><p>At the risk of sounding arrogant (a risk I often take) I am pretty good at spotting Rxs from photos, films etc. I've been doing it obsessively for 25 years! Ryan's lenses in Antitrust have a mild prescription for astigmatism in the -.75 to -1.25 region; I would have said a plano base but I could be wrong. The angle of the cylinder is the same in both lenses. Those he wore in Cruel Intentions were pure plano - as are Daniel Radcliffe's all the way through the film. (Believe me, I kept a very careful look-out.) I suspect the minus glasses he wore for publicity shots had to be abandoned because they reflected the light. Quite often in films, an actor's prescription glasses get switched to non-reflective plano for close-ups. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cheniga</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2001, 14:42</p><p>Because during his interview with Katie Couric, he poked his finger through where the lens should be -- just to demonstrate that he DOES NOT wear glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2001, 11:46</p><p>Cheniga, it was certainly reported a few months ago that Daniel Ratcliffe said he had glasses but didn't wear them a lot; how are you so sure he doesn't?  </p><p>I wondered too about Ryan Phillippe's Rx; I haven't see 'Antitrust', but in 'Evil Intentions' he used glasses much the same way. I reckon he carries enough clout to insist on wearing them when he needs to. There are pics around of him wearing glasses off the set as well (Dom, I posted one on your Yahoo! club) but not, I think, fulltime. I think he uses them roughly the way I did at his age: putting them on when he needs to and not necessarily taking them off straight away. Low Rx with astigmatism certainly fits - but plano-1? How can anyone tell? </p><p>As for Elijah Wood, I complained already about the site where the bio says "wears glasses" but there's only one pic to prove it. </p><p>Christy, WHO is just an ordinary boy at heart? Daniel Ratcliffe? Elijah Wood? Ryan Phillippe? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2001, 11:15</p><p>And how do you know that Daniel Ratcliffe doesn't wear glasses?  He said in early interviews that he did.  As for Dom knowing Ryan's prescription, I would guess that he deduced it from the look of the lenses, as he has done many other times from photos.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cheniga</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2001, 09:45</p><p>Daniel Ratcliffe does NOT wear glasses. Sorry! And how the world do you know Ryan Phillipe's prescription. Did you look at the little piece of paper in his wallet?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2001, 21:06</p><p>Just saw Harry Potter this afternoon. His lenses looked minus in some shots, plano in others. My guess is that the scenes in which the lenses appear plano feature digitally enhanced backdrops. Just a thought.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2001, 14:53</p><p>My guess is that he's just an ordinary boy at heart - with mixed feelings about wearing glasses. Maybe one day when he's old and has written his autobiography - he'll tell us all about it!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2001, 14:52</p><p>And another thing... </p><p> </p><p>I got out Antitrust on video the other night: quite a sweet little movie. As in so many films, the young star, Ryan Philippe, wore glasses to read (in this case, the computer screen) - but, for once, this wasn't just window dressing. His lenses are both are plano/ -1 cyl, and people with that Rx often do wear glasses only for reading.  </p><p> </p><p>Incidentally, all the pictures of Elijah Wood in Lord of the Rings show very visible contact lenses. I bet he's as blind as a mole by now. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2001, 14:47</p><p>Can anyone solve the mystery of Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter)? In early publicity stills he was photographed wearing minus specs with a spot of cut-in; he also said in an interview that he did wear specs. Yet in the (dull) film itself he's plano all the way through, and at the premiere he turned up bare-eyed, explaining that he didn't wear glasses in real life. I'm puzzled. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Marc</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2001, 16:21</p><p>Has anyone seen Kurt Russell with his plus glasses lately? Think he got LASIK?He used to wear them unashamedly.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2001, 06:23</p><p>Last night's episode of Friends:  Chandler wore his glasses the whole episode.  I wish we knew the rationale for when he wears them and when he doesn't.  I suspect it is like all of us:  just a whim.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rod</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2001, 16:45</p><p>I ran across this at surgicaleyes.com.. </p><p>Anyone ever seen a picture of Tiger Woods in glasses? </p><p> </p><p>&gt;from OOPS </p><p>  posted November 02, 2001 01:09 AM     </p><p>&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p><p>&gt;Tiger woods was -13 and -12.  </p><p>Of course, his pupil size may have been manageable due to his ethnicity. </p><p> </p><p>&gt;Also, because he's Tiger, he certainly recieved a more THOROUGH pre-op than most. . . </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2001, 13:31</p><p>Hmm. "If you don't know what to dao I can't show you," as the performer-female said to the bishop. I'll stay antiquated, thanks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2001, 10:08</p><p>Oy - four eyes! </p><p> </p><p>Now that wasn't very PC - but at least it was about glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2001, 09:50</p><p>Of course, the 21st century is derived from the Julian calendar 8-) </p><p> </p><p>Thinking calendrically, the Mayan version is a worthy subject. Its 'welcome' of the Conquistadors as gods shows the folly of hewing to any specific interpretation of what a given time may represent.

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2001, 08:46</p><p>Interesting discussion about PCness.  I suppose whether a given term is overly PC or simply courteous depends on your point of view, and on which end of the word in question you find yourself.  To suggest that one's choice of words never matters would be silly.  To hang on EVERY word is no less silly.   </p><p>&lt;p&gt; </p><p>Some terms we now universally think of as racist or sexist were common usage not long ago.  Popular language is inextricably intertwined with societal values; they evolve together and reflect each other.  Terms we use to describe other people often carry a lot of information about whether that person or group of people is accepted as part of mainstream society or is relegated to the fringes. </p><p>&lt;p&gt; </p><p>I am with Wurm.  Ultimately, it's courtesy that counts most.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dru</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2001, 07:29</p><p>The word to use is "performer". From now on, let's use the terms, "performer-female" and "performer-male." This is the 21st century and terms such as actress are antiquated, as is Julian.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2001, 07:14</p><p>Julian, </p><p> </p><p>Yes, I set up the Actresses thread first. I was trying to start threads that I could actually come up with content for!  </p><p> </p><p>I believe in encouraging courteous behavior in this forum, but I take a dim view of political correctness. </p><p> </p><p>As I understand it, political correctness was a joke started by American lefties to poke fun at themselves. The concept of word police loose in America was intended to be very funny -- a simultaneous gloss on _1984_, McCarthyism and the intrinsic fragmentation of the Left -- but look where it led! Oh well, at least Bill Mahar got it. </p><p> </p><p>Personally, I'm a freethinker. As long as we are having polite discussions, I don't care too much about the structure or topic. If it has something to do with glasses, so much the better.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2001, 00:26</p><p>The acting profession doesn't really subscribe to the usual ideals of sexism, racism or political correctness. The reason they don't is pretty obvious. If the movie plot calls for a white man, or a black woman, or a tall/short or fat/thin person - then those are the only people they're going to interview for the job. If a 'tall thin white man' didn't get a part in a movie when they were specifically looking for a 'short fat black woman' then there's little point him going to court over the matter - or vice versa! </p><p> </p><p>Mind you - if the plot calls for a glasses-wearer - then wouldn't it be nice if they'd use a real glasses-wearer instead of someone in planos?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2001, 23:22</p><p>Is it my imagination or was the 'Actresses' thread set up before this one? &lt;grin&gt; </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rudeman</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2001, 21:18</p><p>I don't consider the word "actress" a sexist term. </p><p>Anybody that does should get a life.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2001, 16:00</p><p>Gentlemen, please realize that this community consists of many nationalities. What may seem a very politically correct or incorrect - especially considering the terms mentioned - may be just a marginal issue for non-american members.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2001, 09:43</p><p>While we here at Eyescene are quite enlightened and know that it is politically incorrect to use the term "actress,"  we also know that we have defied society and set up threads entitled "actors" and "actresses."  This helps us to keep our focus.  Some of us are not interested in females actors who wear glasses, while there are others who don't care about the male actors who wear glasses.  Hopefully, people who post will remember these distinctions.  Meanwhile, like has been said, it is really no big deal.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dru</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2001, 07:27</p><p>Actor is the term for performers of both genders. Actress is a word like waitress or stewardess -- considered sexist and therefore antiquated. Julian, don't worry about it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2001, 02:03</p><p>AAARRRGGGGHHHH! </p><p>An actress in the 'Actors' thread! is nothing sacred? </p><p>::)</p><p></p><hr>

ONE, and that's one of the usual round wire rims at the age of 14 or so. Surely he must take those contacts out sometimes :( </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2001, 08:26</p><p>Have you noticed that Chandler (Matthew Perry) has not worn his glasses in any episode of Friends this season?  Last season, he wore them quite a bit.  This year, he looks a lot more healthy (after his stint in re-hab.)  I wonder if that has something to do with his not wearing the glasses?</p><p></p><hr>
