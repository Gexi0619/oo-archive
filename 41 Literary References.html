<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2014, 20:20</p><p>I vaguely remember a story, many years ago, In Analog (or Astounding) Science Fiction, where one of the characters needed a new pair of glasses.  I can't recall the reason.  He stepped into an Optical Shop, looked into a device, saw a green flash, and a few minutes later was handed some new glasses with his prescription. </p><p>This was years before there was such a thing as an auto-refractor.  I think the time will come when an auto-refractor will be connected to a 3-D printer and it will print a new pair of glasses automatically.  There are lots of problems to solve, such as how to print optically transparent lenses.  Everything today is opaque or nearly so.  Certainly not crystal clear, probably because of entrapped air bubbles, but who says you could not print lenses in a vacuum or submerged in a liquid. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guido</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2014, 19:33</p><p>Amazon,Robert Mehnert, "The Time and Again Trilogy". Especially "In the Blink of an Eye", Ch. 4. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Le Visiteur</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2014, 11:53</p><p>Guido, about that trilogy which you referred to as "I, glasses" on 29 Jul 2012, 18:38, I've tried to search for it but cannot find anything... do you know the author's name or can you provide us with a link where we can get the text, please? Thanks a bunch!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;21 Feb 2014, 17:05</p><p>Two stories come to mind. The World According to Garp, in which Garp's wife wore glasses, and there are some initial comments about how badly she needs them. And in A River Runs Through It, the mom needed glasses quite badly.  </p><p> </p><p>Aside from that, Chaim Potok's novels are filled with glasses-needing Jewish characters, but mostly men IIRC. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;21 Feb 2014, 13:02</p><p>Just wanted to ask if anyone has put together a good list of novels, where the main character wears glasses?  I've been searching and found several.  Some authors do a good job of describing the eyesight without glasses and what the character does with the glasses.  Other authors just mention it like a fashion item.   </p><p> </p><p>I prefer to read about men in glasses, but have been very disappointed with what's out there.  My disappointment has lead me to write my own.   </p><p> </p><p>If there is an author out there who is publishing novels that would appeal to an OO, please let me know.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guido</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2012, 18:38</p><p>I recently read the first two installments of the trilogy referenced by "I, glasses".  It is science fiction and deals with the perception of time and probability.  Essentially, it questions whether a possibility in a time sequence can be altered.  The author has as the central character a beautiful 6' female scientist who is severely myopic.  The author is quite consistent in his treatment of the visual impairment, that being many references to fogged lenses, displaced glasses, ever increasing myopia.  By far the most thorough description is in the .pdf sample that "I,glasses" suggests.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guido</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2012, 09:20</p><p>Recently I read a novel by Michael Palmer, "The Patient" wherein the primary character is a female neurosurgeon.  There are a few references to her putting on her glasses or having her glasses wiped during surgery.  The references would lead one to believe she would be a full time wearer.  There were no prurient details about her vision or eyewear, none the less it was fun picturing her as a moderate myope. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>I, Glasses</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2012, 10:39</p><p>A Dec/2011 post referred to a novel, 'In the Blink of an Eye,' available only via e-reader, that discussed a character's myopia.  Chapters 1-3 of the book are available on the author's Web site.  Early in chapter 1 the lead character, Jennifer, alludes to her poor vision; but in chapter 3, there is a great deal written about her vision and its correction.  If you don't have an e-reader to access the entire novel, I recommend reading at least the chapters that are available at this URL: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419231820/http://www.bobmehnert.com/books/blink.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.bobmehnert.com/books/blink.pdf</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;12 Dec 2011, 05:16</p><p>I have read some survey about Hong Kong, 85% of people aged 18-39 are myopic.  </p><p> </p><p>86% of aged 16-19 are myopic, in 1998.  </p><p>Should not have changed much in 2011 due to the already high rate. </p><p> </p><p>This rate is similar throughout East Asia, all are 60%-90%, excluding Japan.  </p><p> </p><p>The rate is lower in Japan. should be 50%-70% depends on age group. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;11 Dec 2011, 11:41</p><p>There's a novel on Kindle called "In the Blink of an Eye" (it's part of the Time and Again Trilogy) where the main character (a beautiful woman) talks about how nearsighted she is.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>varifocals.</b>&nbsp;11 Dec 2011, 08:53</p><p>OLIM   </p><p>I read in eye scene I think that 85% of Hong Kong are myopic. </p><p>On my recent visit glasses were every where but I did not see any read thick glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2010, 19:30</p><p>Right you are specs4ever. Dr Bates claimed to be able to correct all refractive errors by his exercise and relaxation techniques. I read that dumb book as a child long before I develop visual problems myself. My interest in the book was literally inspired by my obsessiveness of all things optical. I credit that crazy doctor for teaching me a lot about vision, however. The Bates techniques were something my dad practiced but abandoned. I bet that book is still on a bookshelf at his house.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2010, 15:45</p><p>It has been a long time since I read my Bate's method book, but the vague memories from my brain seem to recall Bates telling people that he coudl cure long sight as well as short sight.  Are my memories correct??  I threw out the book by the way. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>oscar</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2010, 13:10</p><p>James, </p><p>I don't think either of the things you say is accurate. </p><p> First, Huxley himself reported that his corneas were scarred when he was 16 and his vision was impaired from then on. In later life he could only read at all with strong glasses and dilated pupils.  </p><p> </p><p>Second, he was long-sighted, not short-sighted, as he reported and as these glasses demonstrate: </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419231820/http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/51887430/Hulton-Archive?language=en-GB&amp;location=GBR" target="_blank">http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/51887430/Hulton-Archive?language=en-GB&amp;location;=GBR</a> </p><p>(if the link doesn't work, just do a google image search for "Aldous Huxley" and "glasses" - there are lots of pictures of him in strong plus glasses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2010, 11:24</p><p>Aldous Huxley was not visually impaired, just extremely nearsighted. He hated wearing glasses, and was a vocal proponent of the Bates method (which, through daily exercises, claims to "cure" nearsightedness). </p><p> </p><p>To demonstrate the veracity of the Bates method, Huxley read a long speech off a teleprompter without his glasses. Later, either he admitted or it was somehow determined (not sure which) that he had, in fact, just learned the entire speech off by heart, and was not reading it at all. </p><p> </p><p>So much for the Bates Method.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2010, 11:02</p><p>Wikipedia is written by amateurs and largely talks nonsense! Huxley I think wrote 'Brave New World' ?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>still</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2010, 22:35</p><p>Yes. He is rather well known. Supposed to be legally blind, or close to it, maybe in later life. Probably can be found in Wikipedia.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2010, 15:04</p><p>Hi, has anyone here heard of the author Aldous Huxley? I read up some things about his controversial eyesight. </p><p>(My class is going to read Brave New World in a week) </p><p> </p><p>I wasn't sure where this fit in exactly..so.. </p><p> </p><p>just wondering if anyone else out there knew about that.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2010, 14:06</p><p>Meant to type "central TO THE plot". </p><p> </p><p>Time for an eye test maybe.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2010, 14:04</p><p>Leave it to Psmith by PG Wodehouse makes frequent (and direct) references to various characters' eyesight, including others' perceptions of those wearing glasses, losing one's glasses etc. </p><p> </p><p>In fact, the loss of a highly myopic character's glasses leads to the mistaken identity that is central plot.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2010, 11:59</p><p>Yes, without referring to the book I remember that somebody, not Piggy himself I think, used his glasses to light a fire, but (again as far as I remember) the author refers to his myopia. I guess those who don't know the vocabulary use the term indiscriminately for any visual defect. </p><p>Again, the cover of the first Harry Potter book shows him in glasses with lots of power rings, but nowhere in any of the books does the author say what he wore glasses for, just that he saw badly without them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2010, 10:57</p><p>Julian </p><p> </p><p>Quite right let's add something. </p><p> </p><p>I haven't seen Lord of the Flies for some time and so maybe can be corrected. But I seem to remember Piggy broke his glasses, in one film he is seen wearing strong minus glasses but uses his glasses to start a fire, which would only be possible with strong plus glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Am i right in this?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2010, 04:27</p><p>Gosh, this thread's been quiet! </p><p>I've been reading several of Sue Townsend's Adrian Mole books lately, and notice that 'he' refers from time to time to his glasses. In (I think) 'Adrian Mole and the Weapons of Mass Destruction' somebody calls him a four-eyed git, and in another place (same book?) he mentions failing to see something and booking an eye test - but there's no mention of a visit to the optometrist or new glasses. It seems to me that the kind of neurotic guy the author shows us would have been bound to get his knickers in a twist about needing, and getting, glasses; and I'm just wondering if anyone here has read the books and can tell me when (i.e. in which book) Adrian Mole first joined the ranks of the four-eyed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;12 Dec 2009, 22:08</p><p>By the way, Chrisb, you have to remember that in the Bard's time glasses for presbyopia were rare, and ones for myopia had not been invented (or rather rediscovered - Nero reputedly had an emerald cut as a concave lens through which he watched the games in the Coliseum).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;12 Dec 2009, 22:00</p><p>I do not have my Shakespeare with me here, but do recall a passage in Julius Caesar where Cassius asks someone to tell him what is in the distance, remarking "my sight was ever thick". When we staged this play at my prep school (many years ago) the part of Cassius was played by a boy who was shortsighted and normally wore quite thick glasses but for authenticity was told not to wear them on stage. I suspect the drama master was an O-O!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrisb</b>&nbsp;10 Dec 2009, 16:26</p><p>Shakespeare the OO ? </p><p> </p><p>I cant remember if I have posted before about Shakespeare, but I am pretty obsessional about shakespeare as well as GWGs - however over years of seeing reading and watching the plays I have always been disappointed about his lack of any reference to OO. Helena in Midsummer nights dream is sometimes played with glasses but I've now come across this passage in Alls well that ends well. Helena (not the one in midsummer nights dream) is lamenting the departure of Bertram he object of her affections (unrequited) to the kings court.  </p><p> </p><p>Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though a plague, </p><p>To see him every hour; to sit and draw </p><p>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, </p><p>In our heart's table; heart too capable </p><p>Of every line and trick of his sweet favour: </p><p>But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy </p><p>Must sanctify his reliques.   </p><p> </p><p>Ok there are no glasses but arched brows and hawking eye is what we are about. </p><p> </p><p>The bit at the start of the verse about  being  a plague also sums up my feeling about glasses obsession at the moment. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2008, 16:45</p><p>Does anyone have any pictures of Mary Stopes-Roe?  She is/was and author and daughter -in-law of the birth-control lady Marie Stopes.  I read somewhere that Marie Stopes became estranged from her son because he married the short-sighted Mary with her 'ugly glasses' against his mother's wishes. </p><p>Sounds like the opposite of OO. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;21 Aug 2008, 11:19</p><p>It's going fairly well, I have all 37 characters given distinct personalities, a general outline formed, along with the first chapter and some incidents in the middle of the story that I need to link together. I must say it is quite a bit different and somewhat harder than writing poetry or short stories, being longer, but I guess in a way I can think of it as just a series of short stories linked together, and that makes it seem easier. It will probably be a year at least before I finish it and get it into print, though. </p><p> </p><p>I ALWAYS make passes at guys who wear glasses, Marie </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;18 Aug 2008, 06:58</p><p>Well, this is just great, I started off by writing my own poems about glasses, but now I'm afraid I've gone a step worse-now I'm re-writing others' poems to make them about glasses! But the last line of this one practically begs for the poem to be "OO-ized (or should that be OO-eyesed?)"-I could, and have, used thousands of words to sum up our fascination with glasses, and here this guy who isn't even writng about glasses does it in just six little words! Here first is the original, as Robert intended: </p><p> </p><p>Upon Julia's Clothes by Robert Herrick </p><p> </p><p>When as in silks my Julia goes, </p><p>Then, then, me thinks, how sweetly flows </p><p>That liquefaction of her clothes. </p><p>Next, when I cast mine eyes and see </p><p>That brave vibration each way free; </p><p>O, how that glittering taketh me! </p><p> </p><p>And now my version, with sincerest apologies to Mr. Herrick (BTW, "seeing" as how MIGs are my thing, I've masculinized Julia. It's obviously not about our Julian, though, since he's a hyperope, hence no white rings, and his glasses aren't thick): </p><p> </p><p>Upon Julian's Specs by Marie </p><p> </p><p>When as in specs my Julian goes, </p><p>Then, then, me thinks, how sweetly flows </p><p>Those white-ring ripples, rows and rows </p><p>Next, when I squint mine eyes and see </p><p>How thick those polished lenses be; </p><p>O, how that glittering taketh me! </p><p> </p><p>I ALWAYS make passes at guys who wear glasses, Marie </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2006, 12:16</p><p>I have two questions here, one is literature and one is about TV, but I wasnt really sure where to post it so thought Id put it here as well. 1. On the TV series Little house on the prairie Mary gets glasses in one episode and in another episode (much later) goes blind. I have read about her blindness in the Little house book series, but find no mention of her wearing glasses. Did the creators of the TV show make that part up or is there a book Im missing? 2. I vaguely remember an episode of a show (for some reason I think it may have been Little house) where there was a little boy who pretended he needed glasses, I believe to impress a girl in his class who wore them. Anyway, the doctor found him out by pretending he couldnt find a candy jar or something across from where the boy was sitting and the boy gave himself away by pointing to it.

Though now actually blind, she still experiences visions alternately (now her only form of sight aside  </p><p> </p><p>from the darkness) but is now suicidal and withdrawn. Bums out the team. Possibility of her regaining her sight ("Through her  </p><p> </p><p>darkest hour") and even more possibility of the first seer with proper vision where corneas may "heal themselves"..

Lots of  </p><p> </p><p>eye exams. Staring and squinting at the eye chart while things gradually get clearer. no one makes a full recovery, but most  </p><p> </p><p>recover back to low - mid myopia. </p><p> </p><p>Seer sees death of the president/something important in a vision and steps are taken to prevent it, however the death occurs  </p><p> </p><p>anyway and the seers must deal with the fact that some things can not be changed, no matter how much precognition has  </p><p> </p><p>occured. </p><p> </p><p>An episode where another nation fearing the economic power that the US has to gain from possession of the seers devises an  </p><p> </p><p>"antidote" eye drop (or hell, LASIK) that makes any seer's vision normal, and worse, it introduces an immunity to the  </p><p> </p><p>original formula. The organisation recovers the formula and this becomes a way out for any seer who wishes to take it.  </p><p> </p><p>Episode will discuss conflict and reasons for staying.

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2004, 18:14</p><p>For lack of the Fantasy Optical thread which used to exist, here is a story I just wrote called: "They made me a Myope" </p><p>I used to be one of the top models in the United States.  But that was years ago before I was imprisoned.  No, I didnt spend time in prison, but wound up with a physical disability that prevented me from modeling ever again.  It is not a real physical disability in the real sense of the word as you would think, but more like a real inconvenience.  It happened to me 8 years ago when I was at the very top of my career. </p><p>	Perhaps you remember Anna Manlova.  She was the top model to come out of then Soviet Union.  We personally were just friendly rivals in a very competitive business.  At Annas insistence, I was invited to tour Russia for a photo shoot.  Having never been there, it sounded very exciting and an excellent opportunity to further my career.  I never expected in a million years what would happen to me. </p><p>	I met Anna at the airport in Moscow.  She was not only lovely, but also quite charming as well.  She spoke no English and I no Russian.  Everything was handled through an interpreter.  The Russians, though dour in appearance and demeanor, nonetheless smiled all the time.  I never knew what they had in store for me. </p><p>After several weeks of shooting in some of the coldest regions of Russia, Anna and I (and her entourage including ever present KGB agents) took a well deserved break from the daily regimen and exhausting work. </p><p>	I was invited to go skiing with her at a lodge near Leningrad.  I never skied before, but to be polite, I decided to go through the motions.  </p><p> What disturbed me about Russia was that we were constantly followed.  Of course, there was the usual photographers, agents and publicity people always present.  What unnerved me was the presence of those men in the dark coats and equally dark hats always pulled over their faces to disguise not only their looks but also their expressions.  Every time I inquired as to who they were, I was always told they were Annas bodyguards.  Personally, I think they were some kind of state security agent, possibly KGB agents.	 </p><p> (to be continued) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Avid</b>&nbsp;31 Aug 2004, 19:33</p><p>Thought I would try bring this thread back to life.  </p><p> </p><p>Has anyone here read "Love in the Time of Cholera" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez? There are more than a few references to the protagonists very poor vision and need to wear thick eyeglasses. </p><p> </p><p>Then there is also Ethan Hawke's debut novel, "The Hottest State". While the book was not as awful as some claimed, it wasn't exactly literary fireworks either.....be that as it may, there were some "delicious" references to the main character's myopia, his use of both contact lenses and glasses, as well as a very realistic description of walking around bare-eyed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>visitor</b>&nbsp;05 Oct 2003, 11:43</p><p>Just read an interesting passage in Queen Noor's memoir (former queen of Jordan, grew up in America, then married King Hussein). Noor describes how terrible her eyesight was when it was discovered she needed glasses in school. She couldn't see the blackboard from the front row. Her father couldn't believe that his daughter needed glasses and had her try to read a magazine from several feet away which she also couldn't even read the headlines. She also described going through high school wearing coke bottle glasses. She must have been a very early contact wearer because a college photo of her showed her without specs. Later in the book she explained briefly that she got lasik in recent years.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;05 Oct 2003, 11:21</p><p>Girls interested in guys wearing glasses should read The Chosen by Chiam Potok and October Sky by Homer Hickam.  Both of these books discuss the main characters' poor eyesight and glasses.  Also, the movie version of Doctor Zhivago has a guy named Pasha/Strelnikov who wears glasses. It's a bit confusing, because in the beginning of the movie, Pasha wears plano or low plus glasses, and later on he has stronger minus glasses.  However, there was no mention of any glasses in the book.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BoBo</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2003, 11:02</p><p>I don't remember much about ary Beth Hurt's glasses in the film, though I did see it a long time ago. I'm guessing they were nothing special, not at least compared to the book, in which a big deal was made about them at the outset. Then again, I don't remember any really steamy GWG scenes in the novel either, but I read it when it first came out in the 70's </p><p> </p><p>I do remember once seeing a cheap TV movie many years ago, in which the male lead always had this dream of flying, but couldn't due to his severe myopia. He wore very strong myodisks in the film, in the range of -20 to -25, but he had this annoying habit of taking them off whenever he had to do anything physical, such as walk around. I'm sure the budget was so low that they didn't even bother to give him contacts under the glasses so he could see. It wasn't very realistic, to say the least, but there were a lot of close-ups to highlight the glasses. I just wished that it was his wife who wore the glasses instead. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BoBo</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2003, 16:57</p><p>"The World According to Garp" cast Mary Beth Hurt asw his wife.  She was a glasses wearer in the film as well as a GWG in life.  She appeared in a TV sitcom several years back as, I believe, a chef where she wore glasses regularly.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BoBo</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2003, 13:43</p><p>Norman MacClean's novel, "A River Runs Through It", tells of the mother of the two brothers needing glasses. There was one scene where she was trying to break up a fight between her sons, when her glasses got knocked off. The was some comment to the effect that "she couldn't see anything without them, and couldn't see very well even with them on". I saw the movie some years after I had read the booking, hoping to see the mother in glasses, but she wasn't casted as a GWG. Too bad. </p><p> </p><p>The other novel from way back was John Irving's "The World According to Garp". The girl Garp ends up marrying wore very strong glasses. ("Needing them as badly as her dad")Garp's mom was all excited about this: "A really pretty girl, and she wears glasses!" Alas, the movie did not make much, if anything, about this. As I recall, she may have worn some planos once or twice in the film, but she largely was without them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2003, 22:56</p><p>Here's an old book you might want to dust off at the library sometime: The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand. There is a character named Catherine, the long suffering sometimes girlfriend of Peter, one of the book's main characters. Early in the book there is a mention of her not being able to see things far away. Later it talks about how she has glasses and won't wear them around Peter. Then after Peter dumps her, there is a passage about her wearing her glasses and taking them off while talking to her uncle, who also wears glasses, as if the two pairs of glasses caused a barrier to communications. And then after she is basically left waiting to elope, there is a passage about her going to work at a home for children, I think, where she is never seen without her glasses. The passage says something about people not liking it when she takes off her glasses because her eyes are not a pretty sight. And then toward the end of the book, Peter runs into Catherine  and she is wearing glasses. In the past she had always taken her glasses off when she saw Peter. This time she leaves them on. I read that book years ago when I was in high school and don't remember a lot of it. But I've always remembered poor, put upon Catherine and her spectacles.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2003, 08:54</p><p>Of course there is the old favorite - The Girl In the Car With Glasses And A Gun by Sebastian Jaspariot(sp).  Also Carter brown had one titled The Myopic Mermaid, and J.J Jance has had glasses mentioned in her last 3 Joanna Brady novels.  Also, years ago I read a couple of Matt Helm mysteries by Donald Hamilton that had a couple of them with references to glasses wearers, but I no longer remember the titles.  The 2 best movies for real glasses are in my opinion A Dangerous Woman, and Strangers on the Train.  In Terminator II, there is a guard on the hospital ward that wears very strong glasses, and these are knocked off by the leading female character when she is escaping.  And, in My Cousin Vinny, there is an elderly African American Lady who is a witness to the robery that is on the witness stand, and she puts on a seriously strong pair of minus glasses.  I always try to remember any books that have the lady with specs scenarios, but alas, there are really too many to note.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;21 Feb 2003, 21:12</p><p>Steinbeck also referred to specs in "Of Mice and Men".  I believe it was Lennie's aunt, who he always remembers as wearing "thick bull's eye glasses".  This description of the power rings of a high myopic lens has always stuck with me.  Perhaps Steinbeck was One of Us?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>still</b>&nbsp;21 Feb 2003, 20:03</p><p>I've never been the first to post to a thread, so thanks for the chance. In "The Wayward Bus", John Steinbeck has a character who is myopic and who compensates for it by pulling at the sides of her eyes - when I read it, long time passing, I found it very erotic.</p><p></p><hr>
