<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;23 Dec 2014, 18:45</p><p>lucy </p><p> From what I am seeing in the US,larger plastic frames,and more people seem to be choosing CR 39 plastic lenses, over the more expensive polycarbonate. </p><p> Actually the CR 39 give better visual acuity,and look better in the larger frames,especially with higher prescriptions.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>A. P.</b>&nbsp;22 Apr 2014, 12:38</p><p>To Melyssa: </p><p>     Hi Melyssa.  I thought you might be interested in some large cats-eye frames which are now listed on the "new arrivals" section of Zenni Optical's website.  They're available in both blue and purple.  I don't know if these glasses will bowl you over, but they just might strike your fancy.  The frame is #203916.  I'll spare you the further details.   Cheers to you!   A.P.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>s</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2014, 20:11</p><p>ric </p><p>When you say small, could you be more specific about size? I mean if you have a apir of glasses already to work from by measuring across the face of them and providing an "overall width" in millimeteres I can likely suggest several locations to check out. Zenni always provides an "overall width" for all of the glasses they sell. One just today popped up in a sidebar that was pretty small look at #485021 it is only 125 mm wide so certainly on the small size for most. That's "zennioptical.com"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest0x0x0</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2014, 16:56</p><p>I have a dilemma in that I prefer the appearance of wire frames, but I have a slightly neurotic fixation that the nosepads are getting out of line; this causes me to constantly make adjustments, few of which are necessary. </p><p> </p><p>To get around this predicament, without paying a fortune for designer saddle-bridge specs, I bought a pair of really cheap, generic-looking metal glasses online and then snapped off the nosepads; I then blunted down the sharp edges left by removing the pad holders. </p><p> </p><p>This has resulted in a very comfortable, if idiosyncratic, pair of glasses that at-once satisfies my need for comfort whilst preserving the ... sleekness I prefer in wire frames. The only problem is that I can't quite get up the nerve to go out in public wearing these frames, as I fear the ridicule of others; they do look a little eccentric on close examination. </p><p> </p><p>For now they make a good pair of *comfort* glasses for hanging around the house. What would you think if you saw metal frames which had obviously had the pads removed? Do you think people outside of this forum in the general public would notice such things? Should I really care?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Apr 2012, 00:09</p><p>John S. </p><p>Yes some very nice frames in that collection for sure. But the buyer needs to be careful as I read a description on one of the plastic pairs and it indicated that the frame had become discolored which means it could be very risky to heat up and remove the existing lenses and replace it with your own rx. But there are some very nice Ray-Ban metal frames that should be fine for re fitting.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Mar 2012, 00:16</p><p>SoCal </p><p> </p><p>You are a woman right??? Then you know the answer to that question. The same as is it possible to have too many pairs of shoes or too many purses. Why would you even bother to ask. Just go for it. lol </p><p>But at some point you will need to decide that it is time to chuck the contacts and go full time glasses only. But of being trendy like Melyssa and wear multiple pairs.  </p><p>Only kidding you can keep the contacts too, but only limited use.</p><p></p><hr>

I have several friends including my Godson that are cops and I know from them just what you say to be true. Like you say one hand washes the other is a good way to put it.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2012, 17:41</p><p>We never favored anyone who gave us free lunches and stuff over anyone who didn't.  But restaurant owners always fed us for free especially diners.  We would get rid of problem customers who gave waitresses a hard time or were drunk and caused situations at night.  We would also let them slide on traffic tickets.  You know, one hand washes the other.  But that was in New York, things are different in other parts of the country.  It was not like taking a bribe if that is what you are thinking.</p><p></p><hr>

For a business, relationship with the authority is important.  </p><p> </p><p>Let's say for a optical store, If you are lucky, you may be able to get some potential clients from these authorities. Such as school officials, may be able to help the school children to get glasses when required, and you can gain some sales of frames. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

I think it is just a way to say thanks to the police for the job that they do, I don't think that they demand something for free. But I am sure they all soon find the shops that give them food and drink at no charge etc.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2012, 17:28</p><p>Stingray </p><p>That's very interesting. That name sounds very familar for some reason. I wonder if he stayed with the company that bought him out maybe? Sounds like he was pretty much a friend as well as someone under your watch? It's never a bad idea to do a trade off of your product for a little extra police protection. That still happens today, most all food and drink places never charge a cop anything. If I owned a shop I would do the same.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2012, 16:01</p><p>In the mid 1970's I worked as a cop in Roslyn, New York.  Silhouette had their manufacturing plant and sales room in my sector.  The owner, Barry Levine wanted to always be a cop and was always checking out my radio car and asking me questions about my gun and other equipment.  I let him drive the police car, put on the red lights and blow the siren every now and then.  In return, he gave me my choices of eyeglass frames.  They were either plastic full frames or all metal frames.  None of them were rimless.  I recall one metal frame that actually folded up over the bridge and in 2 places on the temples.  By the 1980's, when I was transferred out of that town, ten years had passed.  I went back to visit guys I worked with and found that the Silhouette building was empty.  I guess he sold the name and eyeglass frame line to whomever owns it today. </p><p>End of story.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2012, 09:03</p><p>Well, CV, I thought I was sure but you raise some issues. So, will have to dig back into the archives and find out for sure. I notices that they now have a full sunglass line, they are drill mounts but not the very thin wires, wide temples and bold mountings on the lenses at both the temples and the bridge.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2012, 05:13</p><p>I got a pair of glasses (my first bifocals) with Silhouette frames in about 1980. They weren't rimless or semi-rimless, they were full frames in black metal with white detailing - very smart in the fashion of the time and very expensive1</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2012, 17:19</p><p>Revolver, </p><p> </p><p>I have about 100 Silhouette glasses in my collection, most are   from the 1970's, 1980's and early 1990's but none of them are rimless. Are you sure that Silhouette made rimless glasses before the mid 1990's?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2012, 11:01</p><p>Obviously no one asked me what my favorite frame style is.  I thought ECP stood for "Extra-Crazy People."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2012, 08:39</p><p>2 days ago, in response to Astra, I posted a blurb about how fashionable semi-rimless are, and then yesterday read an article that totally confirms that. </p><p> </p><p>A survey was taken of U.S. ECP's and one of the questions asked was what is the most popular frame you dispense.  The number 1 answer, by quite a margin, was semi-rimless. Guess it's not just our imagination, although they didn't say how many ECP's participated in the survey so it could be flawed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2012, 08:39</p><p>Silhouette is the epitome of rimless, always have been and always will be. I doubt very much they will ever get away from their base, and of course many others from low end knockoffs up to other top enders have emulated them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2012, 16:27</p><p>Re the discussion about rimless glasses in 2012 eyewear fashion: so far, I tend to agree with Revolver. Silhouette made fantastic big framed glasses in the 1970's and 1980's, then they switched to smaller frames with a marble structure and they have not designed anything but rimless glasses for the past decade. If Silhouette decides to change their style again, that would be a signal of change. The situation abroad may be different but this is what I see in Holland.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2012, 15:29</p><p>A secretary at work wears small rimless frames and has done so for the past 4 years or so.  She told me that next time she will try a different style.  I suggested that maybe she can go to the opposite end of the frame spectrum, pointing to the large, sky-blue top-temple frames I was wearing.  Only time will tell.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2012, 08:42</p><p>Astra, rimless are not at all off fashion in fact they are timeless classics. They appeal to those who want, and look good wearing, the "no-glasses" look. This is not really a no glasses look, rather an understated one that doesn't dominate the face but rather accentuates it like a fine piece of jewelry.  This look can further be enhanced by different shaped frames with polished edges. </p><p> </p><p>And the current semi-rimless are exceptionally in tune with today's styles as so many of them have the stylish wide temples which allow for designs and/or bold colors.

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2012, 10:58</p><p>And forgot to say on previous post that Soundman is right, you won't find Wal-Mart or any other high-production lab operation that will facet.  But suspect there are many small labs that will, I know of one medium sized one in particular where the lab manager has been there nearly 40 years and can and will do it although there will of course be a surcharge.  But don't know how much longer he'll be around, and possibly when he retires his craft will retire with him.  It really is an art, no computer, lens tracer, etc. can do that stuff.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2012, 09:59</p><p>Soundman: </p><p> </p><p>Did the same thing but have about a dozen of them left, the big problem now is finding authentic nosepads.  That same problem applies to some of my 50's combo frames, plastic temples that end in cables, plastic top rims with metal bridges and 2 or 3 different methods of attaching the pads. </p><p> </p><p>Also have a few of that same pair of Art Craft you describe, my favorites don't have cables and the lenses were obviously made much later as they are CR-39.  They are -8.00 sphere OU, hexagonal in the size and shape someone here on ES described as McNamara glasses after the old SECDEF, and of course quite thick.  Occasionally use them GOC just to draw some stares at the grocery store.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2012, 12:41</p><p>Revolver </p><p>Something I did keep out years ago was some old rimless glasses that were very nice. They were made by Art Craft and the same glasses were fitted for both men and women. They had glass lenses and the frame was a thin wire gold filled and they had cable temples and the nose pads were made of ivory. After collecting many of these glasses I asked one day what they did with them and was told they melted them down for the gold content and they were happy that they would net about $1.00 for each frame. From that time on I kept them and several years later as I mentioned this style of glasses to some of the younger opticians I started to bring them around to show them and many of them found them cute so I would give them a pair. I now only have a few left.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2012, 12:15</p><p>Moonshiner </p><p>Yes those glasses were very well made and look very expensive. I really doubt that Wal-Mart could make lenses anywhere close to that style, I am not sure too many labs even do beveled edges anymore. My only wish is that when I came across quite a few of them years ago in the donated boxes I would have kept some of them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2012, 09:36</p><p>Charlie is right about the thicker the lens the more tensile strength they had.  And again, no real problems with keeping the screws tightened, the same as any other drill mounts, as long as the nylok washers were in place and replaced if they showed any wear.  The ones in my collection have been well worn, and are still in excellent condition. </p><p> </p><p>There was one problem, however, in that they are CR-39 as materials like polycarbonate and Trivex hadn't been invented yet.  Occasionally, spider web cracks would appear at the screw holes especially if they were overtightened, this happened on a couple of my pairs that were plus as the edges were thin.  Now, the labs strongly discourage ordering any drill mount unless it's polycarb or Trivex and if you do insist on CR-39 will limit their warranty. </p><p> </p><p>Needless to say, the screws on the higher minuses were long! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2012, 20:13</p><p>Soundmanpt is right about the fragility. My ex-wife and I bought these glasses in the late 1970's and the screws in her minus 6-7 lenses always came loose. We asked for the price of adding those nice facets to the sides of her lenses as they were a centimeter thick, but the price was crazy so we left it at that. Portraits of models wearing this type of glasses with facets can be seen in some of my early photo shoots - Rachel springs to mind.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Charlie_0186</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2012, 10:01</p><p>Although I have never worn nor handled them, I always thought that the thicker the (minus) lens, the stronger those faceted three-piece glasses would be.  Depending of course on the strength of the screw through the lens. </p><p>Whatever, I think that these were still the ultimate in facial jewelry, especially in relatively high prescriptions.  I would love to see them come back into fashion.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2012, 09:51</p><p>Soundman is right about how they're constructed, but never experienced any particular difficulties in keeping them tight as they have small nylok washers between the screws, nuts, and lenses. </p><p> </p><p>One of my pairs is -6.00, not quite up to your standards, but because of the thickness the facets are gorgeous, truly jewelery for you face. </p><p> </p><p>Would it not e for the fact I'm technologically impaired would post a photo of them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2012, 21:17</p><p>Melyssa </p><p>They really were fragile. Most of them had a split temple where it attached to the lens and so it needed 2 drill holes there as well as one close to the nose pad area of the lens. The screws always seemed to get loose and the screws were a nut and bolt system. You had to be careful when you would be tightening be cause if you used too much pressure you could break the lens. But they were very attractive on the ladies. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2012, 14:14</p><p>I remember those faceted frames.  They did look nice, but I never understood how they held up, and I knew they wouldn't work for my strong RX -- I'm not even sure there were high-index lenses then.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2012, 12:18</p><p>Revolver </p><p>I have been with a non profit vision group now for many years and recall seeing many of those frames you were mentioning. I think they were some of the most stylish ever made. Even back then they were quite expensive. I really loved the rimless drill mount faceted edge ones with the gradiated tints. I recall the lab people hated them as they were very difficult to cut the lenses and drill.  </p><p>One of the stores I made pickups, donated glasses, hired a new girl to be an optician. She was told she would have to wear glasses while working that they would provide for her, but she was allowed to choose whatever she wanted. She hated the idea of wearing glasses because she didn't need glasses. But she proceeded to order a pair of that style of rimless drop temples with everything you could get on them. She told me that if she would have had to pay for them they would have cost over$600.00. But after she got them and wore them as she was told she soon decided she actually liked them. Why? Because she sold a good number of them just like the ones she was wearing and she made a nice commission from each sale. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2012, 09:47</p><p>Melyssa: </p><p> </p><p>Finally got around to inventorying my drop temples, and all in all have 24 of them that are suitable to be rx'd although nearly all of them already have lenses ranging from +3.00 single vision to -5.00.  A couple of them have primitive progressives in them, and a couple are FT bifocals.  6 of them are rimless drill mounts with faceted edges in various shapes, and there are some with the fashion tints of the day. </p><p> </p><p>But IMHO the stars of the show are 2 Playboy frames, deep drops with the bunny on the temple at the hinge.  The temples are enameled and the frame fronts have enamel on top and fade to nearly clear at the bottom.  They are made of an old material called Optyl which is very durable, but difficult to bend to fit as they are quite vulnerable to overheating. </p><p> </p><p>One of them is brown with a #3 brown sun lens in about -4.50 which due to the eyesize creates thick edges and a plano (flat)front.  The other is a beautiful blue and has never been rx'd.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2011, 00:50</p><p>Revolver &amp; Soundmanpt </p><p>  One of the enjoyable things on these dates,was at somr point during the movie,to lean back,and put my arm around her,and lean over to her, and unbeknowenest to her peek through her lense.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;17 Dec 2011, 09:27</p><p>Likelenses: </p><p> </p><p>Hee, hee, hee, your date reminds me of one back in university many years ago.  Lived off campus in a hole in the wall apartment which allowed me to indulge in my other favorite sport, cooking. Was at a grocery store late one aft, and bumped into a gorgeous blonde w/o glasses and no apparent difficulty seeing.  We hit it off, asked her out to a movie the next night, we drove the 20 miles or so to a larger city and again, no glasses.  We were seated, and I had my usual pair of -.75 (which I didn't really need but carried if the need came up to start a glasses conversation) in my pocket.  Just as the show started I decided to put them on and then see if maybe she would like to try them, but before I could she reached into her purse and put on a black framed pair with a fairly strong minus and cylinder.  I put mine on and tried to make light of the fact both of us had to wear them to see a movie, but she wasn't having any.  Movie ended, off came her glasses and she buried them in her purse, end of story.  Never dated again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Dec 2011, 09:17</p><p>Likelenses </p><p>Yes I was on a number of dates that went just the same way. Now it seems that its much different. I was at the local shopping mall yesterday and of course many colleges are on break now until mid December and it was interesting tom see so many young ladies wearing glasses. At one point I got a drink and found a nice soft chair and it was entertaining to see so many wearing glasses. Most of them with weak or mild rxs many maybe had been wearing them to drive to the mall and unlike a few years ago now they don't bother taking them off anymore but prefer to just continue to wear them to see things in the stores better from outside through the windows etc.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;17 Dec 2011, 00:44</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p>  Yes,I remember dating girls,and if we went to a movie they would take the encased glasses out of their purse and kind of sheepishly slip them on, and if there was an intermission they would whip them off,before the lights came on ,and back on when the lights went out.Some had significant prescriptions,but never wore full time. </p><p>  There was one particular girl that was moderately nearsighted,with quite a bit of astigmatism that would take them off,and on so much that they were all loose,and distorted. </p><p>  A typical date with her was pick her up at her apartment bare eyed,walk out to my car and when I began driving, on they went.When we arrived at where ever we were going,off they came.Then at the event,on they went again,and after the event off they came,until in the car,and on, and on.Really quite erotic.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2011, 10:52</p><p>gwgs </p><p>Not that many years ago women were much more likely to tolerate a slight blur rather than be seen wearing glasses and would maybe only put them on when they really needed them for something and take them off quickly there after. But because glasses have become very popular they now tend to embrace wearing glasses as it has become chic and fashionable. So it becomes a thing where now they enjoy the fashion and they can see better as well so they are more inclined to wear their glasses more often and even full time.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2011, 10:40</p><p>Astra </p><p>It appears to be a plastic (acetate) frame. They simply heat the frame a bit which allows the frame to become flexible enough to fit the lens into it. As it cools the frame will contract and keep the lens from falling out.  </p><p>The caution is if you have a pair of glasses for several years and wish to replace your lenses into it the plastic is much more brittle and there is a risk that the frame may snap when you remove your old lenses or go to insert the new ones. Most opticians are pretty good at determining the risk.</p><p></p><hr>

When I got home, I sort of regretted not going for the Ray Bans which were this pair: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210093058/http://www.framesdirect.com/framesfp/Ray-Ban_RX-tdrble/r.html" target="_blank">http://www.framesdirect.com/framesfp/Ray-Ban_RX-tdrble/r.html</a> </p><p>so I phoned up and asked them to hold my order over the weekend whilst I think about it.   </p><p> </p><p>I quite like the idea of something different but I am a bit anxious about such a big change - sort of reminds me all over again of the anxieties I had when I first got glasses. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 May 2011, 15:17</p><p>Clare - I think the glasses your talking about looks like what zenni sells. Have a look at either #820415 (brw) or 220421 (blk) in "zennioptical.com"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 May 2011, 15:13</p><p>Clare what did you wear fake ones? I think what your referring to is the oversized Ray-Ban Wayfarers popular as sunglasses in the 70's. now they are the rage as regular glasses. I have sold a good number to the ladies at Hooter's and other sports bars. I actually have more on order from zenni. My guess is they will be sold within the week when they arrive. </p><p>I was wondering where you have been. Haven't seen you in here for a good while. </p><p>Maybe you can get a pair of those glasses after your next exam, which must be getting close?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;08 May 2011, 15:05</p><p>ehpc - I don't think everyone can carry them off though, I'm sure I'd look ridiculous!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;08 May 2011, 15:01</p><p>French people do have a reputation (in England at any rate) for being 'stylish' - a reputation not always justified in my experience :) I am sooooooo hoping the very large frames will become the norm :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;08 May 2011, 14:41</p><p>On a recent trip to meet colleagues in Paris I was struck by the number of them wearing those trendy oversized glasses. We know that the French have a reputation for being stylish but in a meeting of 5 of us, four of them (me excluded) wore them and ranged from 20s to 50s in age. They looked good and it really worked for them. In London I seem to see more people for whom the look really doesn't work than does.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2011, 18:32</p><p>Clare </p><p>I am very surprised that the glasses in Hong Kong were more expensive than going on-line to purchase glasses? Most all the on-line retailers are based in Hong Kong. I will remember that because I would have been very wrong. Well then I guess you will need to do some more checking out of Zenni and Great Glasses .com? Zenni now has the option that allows you to put a picture up and try glasses that way. At the least it should be fun to play with? I have had several of my friends use that and they had fun with it and said it helped in choosing glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2011, 13:55</p><p>I was recently in Hong Kong and dropped into a local opticians - mostly to see if they had any interesting frames not available in the West, but also to see how their prices compare. </p><p> </p><p>They really pushed the big frames! The prices didn't compare well to the internet though so I came home empty-handed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2011, 09:48</p><p>Emma </p><p>That style is very popular with the young stars in Hollywood these days Hilary Duff wears hers most all the time when she is out as does Mandy Moore. Besides helping you see they also make a great fashion statement. You made a great choice for your first ever glasses. Your girlfriends are going to be very jealous of you. You will be shocked at how many will want to try them. Cool glasses are very in. Enjoy! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Laura</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2011, 04:43</p><p>gwgs, I must check, thanks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2011, 04:33</p><p>Hi Laura, email sent! regards, gwgs</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2011, 10:42</p><p>When I wore metal frames a lot of many decades ago, the nose pieces kept falling out -- and that was for both pairs, over a 3-year period.  That was my peeve about them.  And with my RX always increasing, plastic frames became necessary for the thicker lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2011, 09:14</p><p>Hi Laura </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for your info, I'll take some photos tonight and email them over to you!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Laura</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2011, 07:56</p><p>gwgs. I'm at -10.00 and rising so I'd be interested in seeing metal frames with such a high rx.  </p><p> </p><p>My email address is: short-sightedlaura@hotmail.co.uk </p><p> </p><p>I'm not sure metal frames are suitable for me now </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rayray</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2011, 07:51</p><p>I like the fit of metal frames better to be honest with the nose pads. At -8.50 I have some semi rimless with 1.74 index lenses that are only about 6mm thick. The lady in specsavers was concerned that 'even with the high index they will be about 6mm thick and stick out quite a lot'. I felt like saying that really is nothing - u should go to a couple of websites... but I just said that it was fine i was used to thick glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>With the field of vision thing I find frame size fairly irrelevant as the actual area of corrected vision is very small with high myopes - pretty much straight ahead, the lens area to the side offers a fairly distorted view. Plus small frames tend to sit closer to the eyes which is the most important thing to visual field with myopia. An when I see relatively high myopes with their glasses halfway down their nose i really want to push them up for them. I think its very attractive for a girl with a pony tail to have her glasses fit well over the ears. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2011, 06:09</p><p>They certainly are Laura! I can post several photos if you would like so you can see that these really do work with high prescriptions. </p><p> </p><p>Metal frames look great with decent prescriptions, and you shouldn't be put off by this, maybe your optician at the time was careless about installing the lenses and ground one of the edges down a little too much so it was very delicate and didn't fit into the frame like it should.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Laura</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2011, 03:51</p><p>gwgs. Honestly? wow. Well when I was at school I had some rectangular black metal frames and my right lens was always popping out. I suppose I was careless, but you know what its like at that age. I was in the -7.00 region and each time I took them off to go swimming I would find them in the case, usually with only one lens in tact. Then it was a case of asking one of my friends to try and shove the other one back in, cos I couldn't really see if it was in the grove properly. It was a nightmare, so next time I went for glasses I got plastic frames with wide sides. To be honest I like metal frames, kind of sexy if the lenses are thick aren't they? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2011, 03:13</p><p>Laura, I've had quite a few metal frames made up with prescriptions over minus 6, some of these are -9.50 upwards and hold the lenses which are approx 1cm thick perfectly without a problem.  </p><p>One of these is even a semi rimless 53mm lens size frame which has an outside edge lens thickness of 13mm! </p><p>What issues or models of frames have you had issues with as I certainly haven't come across this?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Laura</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2011, 02:26</p><p>Thanks Rayray, </p><p> </p><p>The thing is when you have a relatively high scrip like me, you need sturdy frames to hold the lenses firm. metal are hopeless once you get over -6.00 or -7.00.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2011, 00:02</p><p>I would guess with high minus rx (above -10), it can be good enough to have small frames. </p><p> </p><p>The visual field increases with higher minus rx. </p><p> </p><p>so that to outsider we may think they are looking at the frames but actually they can still see some slightly distorted images from their front. </p><p> </p><p>but at rx of milder than - 8 (roughly)  or any plus rx, the visual field is can be very restricted. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2011, 12:46</p><p>Now you all know why I wear large frames all the time, besides them fitting better.  I am so glad that they have held up well all these years, because the U.S. has yet to wake up to getting bigger (and more colorful) frames.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2011, 11:13</p><p>Ditto rayray's comments! </p><p> </p><p>I agree that bigger frames are the way to go. I always wondered how people managed with high prescriptions in such small frames that the lens size barely covered the perimeter that their eyes would cover. Bigger frames eradicate this problem, but created another - I've seen quite a few girls wearing these bigger, wider armed frames which are 1/3 to 1/2 down their nose yet as they can still see out of the lenses, and not over or on the frames they are walking around like everything is fine when their spex need a good push up their nose, and the end of the arms adjusting so they sit properly! I'm presuming that with the increased lens sizes they just can't be bothered pushing them up all the time and see life through a slightly more hazy view!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Laura</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2011, 05:06</p><p>Clare. </p><p> </p><p>It sounds like you are struggling to find frames you really like yourself in. I know it can be problematic. Especialy when your distance vision without lens-filled frames is very restricted like mine. I've gone for larger plastic this time in very dark brown, squarish shaped and most people say they look good on me. It seems that larger frames are becomming trendy again, after all those really tiny metal frames I wore as a kid. At least with bigger frames you have a much wider area you can focus on. better all round vision.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2011, 10:19</p><p>This article seems more reasonable: </p><p> </p><p>Xiamen is located in China's southeastern Fujian province. Xiamen is just the opposite side of the Taiwan Strait which is very close to Taiwan, therefore most the Xiamen glasses enterprises are Taiwan-mainland joint vetures. Different from other districts in China, Xiamen mainly focuses on the production and marketing of high-end sunglasses. </p><p> </p><p>Wenzhou is in eastern China's Zhejiang province, the famous "Land of Overseas Chinese". Wenzhou's optical companies focus on manufacturing middle- to low-end frames and sunglasses. Its market of sunglasses in the world's market is about 40%. Wenzhou has about 1000 manufacturers in the area of frames, sunglasses and other accessories. </p><p> </p><p>Danyang is in Jiangsu province which is near to Shanghai and Zhejiang province. This is a place where mostly the factories are engaged in the making of all types of middle- to low-end lenses. While Danyang also has some enterprises manufacturing frames, but the quality of the frames is of low end. The annual lenses producing capacity of Danyang is 150-200 million pairs which occupies about 70% of China's total volume and 50% of the whole world's. </p><p> </p><p>2. China's eyeglasses indutry is export-oriented. In 2007, China exported 2.465 billion pairs of eyeglasses frames, lenese and sunglasses, with a total value of 3.344 billion US dollars. Unfortunately the average export price is only USD1.36 per pair. About 60% of China's total production of eyeglasses-related goods is for export, which has a world's low-end market share of 80%. In total China has about 4000 manufacturers in the eyeglasses and relative areas.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2011, 17:22</p><p>Clare </p><p>I have never been there, but the mere fact that almost all frames are now made in Hong Kong I would think that to be true. I know for a fact that there is no American frame maker in the USA anymore. Pearle Vision which is a large chain store 90% of the frames are from HK. I think if you spend some time you will find the perfect frame. Also I think all or most all of the on-line retailers are based in Hong Kong. </p><p>It might be a very good idea to get contact information from the different shops so if down the road you need a new rx you can contact them to get new glasses if you wish. </p><p>I must admit I am somewhat surprised that you are even considering the idea of wearing glasses more often.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2011, 14:21</p><p>I'm going on a trip to Hong Kong later this month. As you'll all know I'm still hunting for that *perfect* pair of frames that might make me even want to wear them. Does anyone know if HK is still a glasses mecca?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2011, 08:59</p><p>BD </p><p>Well if she has given you an indication that she likes that style of frame maybe when you see someone wearing that style on TV or out in public you should comment on how you like the glasses that person is wearing. Then you could even say to your gf "if you had glasses like that would you wear them more?" That would be letting her know you like how she looks in glasses and you really want her to wear them more. My guess is that she may have several pairs but they are probably earlier pairs with weaker lenses in them. She is likely reluctant to wearing them much because she is afraid of becoming dependent on them. But I think if you keep letting her know how cute she is wearing them she will wear them and more. The right frame may be the answer. Someone I know that has a much weaker rx that your gf ordered a pair of the glasses like your thinking about, these came from zenni and look just like the Ray-Ban Wayfarers. Before this I never saw her wear glasses, but since she got these she wears them all the time now. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BD</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2011, 05:19</p><p>Thank you to those who commented on my post, especially Flaine and Soundmanpt. Your advice is good and I have taken that on board.  Yes, I agree, that the frames I have chosen are bold and thick rimmed, and therefore probably not the best frames to choose for someone who is hesitant about wearing her frames. There is a reason behind my decisions though, and that is, unless she is mis-guiding me, she likes that look - the bold, geeky style. I guess that is what makes it all the more confusing, in that she likes glasses but doesn't wear them often. Does that make her shy about wearing glasses? </p><p> </p><p>And to confuse the matter even more, she actually has about 5 pairs of glasses in her collection, all of which are plastic rimmed! </p><p> </p><p>Flaine, I don't think lens thickness is her issue. As you identified, at -2.5, that should not be an issue. I don't know what her current lens material is but she has never commented about how she dislikes her lenses. </p><p> </p><p>Soundmanpt, I was pleasantly delighted to read that you thought my gf should being wearing her glasses most of the time, if not all the time. Being a non-wearer myself I don't understand the concept that everything she sees is blurry. I do catch her squinting now and then at finer details in the distance or say when watching or reading something on TV. </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps I do need to compliment her more when I do see her in them. Is this just frustrating for you all, or does it make my case even more curious and interesting to crack!?!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2011, 10:40</p><p>BD </p><p>I think you need to be very careful about what you plan on doing. She may think that your wanting to purchase other glasses for her means you don't like how she looks in her current pair.If you still want to get her a different pair of glasses maybe when your out with her make a point to walk past an optical store and then suggest some frames in the window and maybe you can get her to go in and try a few on that way.  Personally I like the idea much better of going places and doing things that she will to wear her glasses for. At -2.50 she will need them for anything that requires even a little distance. Watching TV, going to movies, sporting events etc. all are great ideas maybe even suggest she drive. Also when whatever you are doing ends and she takes her glasses off maybe tell her how cute she is wearing them. The more she wears them the more comfortable she should get about wearing them more. </p><p>The frames you have picked out are all big and bold. It seems like your girlfriend is very shy about wearing her glasses now. I doubt that she is ready to be that much out there?  </p><p>When you have suggested that she wears her glasses, what is her response? She really should be wearing them most of the time if not full time. I'm sure she struggles often times by not having them on and anything in the slight distance is a blur for her.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Flaine</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2011, 07:01</p><p>BD, </p><p> </p><p>From my experience as an reluctant glasses wearer(i have almost the same rx as ur gf), i dont think you should go for all these frames. </p><p> </p><p>1. Biggest mistake i made was that the first pair i bought, were of similiar boldness, albeit slightly smaller. U have to understand the point she prefers to go in a daze means that she is rather vain. How on earth do you expect her to take on the streets suddenly in these 'stand outs'? Although i may be wrong, that was what i felt.. </p><p> </p><p>2. Judging by your budget, you should be able to get a high index lens filled in for your gf plus a small but delicate frame(ur choice depending on her facial shape, hair colour). Her reluctance to wear glasses might be due to the fact that she finds her current pair of lens too thick(shouldnt be the case for a -2.5 like me), but alas, higher index would make it seem a little thiiner! </p><p> </p><p>Hope that helps:)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>anon</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2011, 05:03</p><p>I wouldn't buy her any of these frames.  I know that style is currently all the rage with film stars and other celebs but, as with all fashion, just because it is fashionable doesn't mean you look good in them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Like lenses</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2011, 23:45</p><p>BD </p><p> Take her out on dates where only good distance vision is required. </p><p> Movies, and you pick the seats farther in the rear. Same with concerts,or sports events. </p><p> Out for a drive at night is always good. Or my all time favorite,a drive in movie,parked far back. </p><p> Any of these will be visually demanding,and if she doesn't wear the glasses,you can go on about how great the view is,and she will realize that she needs the glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Laura</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2010, 08:57</p><p>James, </p><p> </p><p>Big frames definitely are making a come back. I work as an optical assistant at Specsavers Opticians and we have a rack full on them. Unfortunately they aren't good news for people with high minus prescriptions like me, as the bigger the lenses, the thicker they are around the edges. This is ineviatble with a concave lens, but luckily we can do them in High Index plastic now. Not like the thick heavy glasses lenses were, when big frames were all the rage in the 1980/1990s</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2010, 14:37</p><p>princess </p><p>Actually you have done very well in your first week. I'm sure the more you wear them the less you will notice you have them on. Also if you sent pictures to your friends of you wearing your glasses you know the next time you see them in public if your not wearing glasses they will want you to put them on. After many complements it will make it that much easier to leave them on when you go out. It will help the more you get used to seeing yourself in glasses.The blurs should soon go away and you will be a full time wearer.  </p><p>It is very possible that the other mom that showed up that day wearing glasses normally wears contacts and may have been running late and just quickly put the glasses on to get the child to the bus on time.Hopefully she didn't feel bullied by the loud mouth.  </p><p>Please keep us informed as to how you are doinfg and if the blur is getting better etc. Also since you have chosen glasses and are wearing them we should probably move to either the "New Glasses" thread or the "Hyperopia and Prebyopia" thread.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>princess</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2010, 09:55</p><p>thanks Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>yeah my right eye is pretty much fine, it is only slightly blurred...i have worn the glasses to the shops a few times and at home, but not socially </p><p> </p><p>i may wait until i feel fully comfortable/more dependant on the glasses b4 i go to my sons school so i can kind of forget im wearing them? </p><p> </p><p>i might change my facebook profile pic of myself, might be easier, then all my friends and family can see the pic first... lol </p><p> </p><p>btw, the first time wearer that was at my sons school, i have never seen her wear glasses again.. either she was concious of the remark ? or decided on contacts? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2010, 08:52</p><p>princess </p><p>I was curious how you have been doing wearing your glasses? You not unlike many new glasses wearers that find going completely full time in public hard to overcome. Sadly there always seems to be that one person that just doesn't think before they open their mouth with a stupid childish comment. Like Julian stated she will only make a comment once and it will be done. Knowing that she will likely make a comment you should be prepared for a reply. Something like "yeah I thought I would join the group" while smiling. How did the other first time wearer respond? Has she continued to wear glasses each day after the remark? Don't let this person stop you from wearing your glasses.  </p><p>It seems that your eyes are adjusting to glasses rather well. Your close vision was instantly better and your distance vision seems to be still adjusting. As the days go by and you wear your glasses more I think your left eye will soon be fine. How is your right eye for distance with and without your glasses? The reason that your eyes feel tired and achey when you are out and not wearing your glasses is because your eyes are getting used to having the extra help (glasses) and without them now your eyes are straining to see. </p><p>Have you worn your glasses at all in public, like at work, with family and friends etc? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2010, 04:28</p><p>princess: the loud and obvious comments will happen only once, twice at the most. Better to get them over and then everybody will forget they ever saw you without glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>princess</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2010, 04:18</p><p>hi there </p><p> </p><p>just thought i would update my first week of wearing my new glasses, well it has been a bit on/off, i have been wearing part time due to being quite self concious.. i have found much improvement wearing them though, my eyesight seems alot worse without them, especially for the computer, ...i havent worn them out of the house much but i noticed when i went out this morning (without glasses) my eyes felt really tired achey like i wanted to put them on...left eye at distance is still blurred with glasses both on and off, but i guess that will take time to settle, the left eye i think has got worse/more blurred without the glasses? </p><p> </p><p>i dont want to wear them to take my son to school, there is a lady (glasses wearer herself) who is really loud and makes obvious comments...well there was a new glassses wearing mum at the school who came to school wearing them for the first time, and she said to her loudly and jokingly ''ohhh..hello 4 eyes'...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;09 Sep 2010, 15:30</p><p>In defence of rimless glasses I have to say that, despite what seems many years of glasses wearing and multiple pairs of glasses, they are the most comfortable but they seem kind of dull.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;09 Sep 2010, 04:18</p><p>Princess </p><p> </p><p>It is very, very common for people to wear plus lens glasses all the time. </p><p> </p><p>Your prescription is the same (except for some cylinder correction) that my wife had several years ago. </p><p> </p><p>Whenever she got new stronger glasses, she also found distance initially a little blurred, but this soon changes and results in clearer vision. With the advantage of being able to read road signs and destination boards! </p><p> </p><p>My wife had rimless glasses for her first pair, but now has some quite thick framed red/black glasses. However for a first time wearer, and until you get used to wearing glasses, I think you will find the semi-rimless easier, as you will not be too aware of them forming a line on your face.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Sep 2010, 01:47</p><p>princess </p><p>Also if your left eye continues to go in and out of focus even with your glasses after a week or 10 days you may need to consult your doctor. It sounds like the right eye doesn't do that? That's something your glasses should correct when your eyes get completely adjusted to them. It could be just learning to focus with the added help.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Sep 2010, 01:40</p><p>princess </p><p>I thought that you would prefer the semi-rimless at least until your eyes get adjusted to the prescription. It is not uncommon to wear + glasses full time. As you indicated by the doctor asking if you were going to get contacts it would seem to indicate he wants you to wear them for all distances from the start. Never worry about what you think others think about your glasses. When you see someone wearing glasses do you have any idea if they are wearing + or - glasses or how strong they may be. Even if someone tries your on and remarks that they seem like readers all you have to say is that you have some astigmatism and were told to wear them full time. No one will dispute you about that, because they have no way of knowing. You will notice that the blur will get to be less and less each day until it goes away completely. I would think that the television should soon be the first thing that will become clear with your glasses and then signs in the distance will get easier to read at greater distances.  </p><p>Have you had any comments about wearing glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>princess</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2010, 16:03</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p> </p><p>thanks for your reply, yes they are the frames i have (the ones i posted on here a few weeks ago)......your right the semi rimless are easier to wear, i can wear them very easily and forget i am wearng them as they are comfortable, but am aware when im wearing the bold, although i prefur the look of the bold ones, i dont mind wearing them in public but i have this feeling that people will wonder why im wearing + glasses full time as most people seem to think they are just for reading?? maybe im just paranoid? do many people wear + glasses full time? </p><p> </p><p>yeah the distance vision is blurred but not too bad, the close up vision is much much better, but my left eye goes 'in and out' of focus (as it always does without glasses anyway) at both distances but is still better with glasses than without... </p><p> </p><p>x x  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2010, 15:30</p><p>princess </p><p>By the way did you end up getting the frames you showed us back on Aug. 17th? I think they both look really nice and stylish. If they are what you chose you should get many complements with both pairs.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2010, 15:23</p><p>princess </p><p>Glad to hear that your glasses arrived. I am sure what you are seeing as blurry is your distance? I would bet that you will find anything close much better very quickly. It is very common for your distance vision to be blurred until your eyes adjust to the lenses. It may take a week or maybe 2 weeks until your eyes adjust fully. The best thing to do is put your glasses on as soon as possible in the morning and keep them on until bed time. Soon your distance vision will be crystal clear with your glasses and slightly blurred without. </p><p>Until you get used to wearing glasses I suggest that you wear the ones that are more comfortable for you. Remember even though your mate doesn't like the rimless ones others may find them more attractive on you. I am guessing you haven't been out yet wearing them? Are you going to be okay wearing your glasses in public for the first time? Have you been telling people that you were getting glasses? Remember the "princess is wearing glasses" thing will only last a few days and quickly no one will notice. You will get many complements from family, friends and co workers, some will want to try them.  </p><p>Let us know how the next few days go as you get used to your glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>princess</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2010, 14:54</p><p>i got my new glasses yesturday, i had a tummy ache yesturday so didnt really get a chance to wear them until today, i got 2 pairs, my partner said i looked 'old' in the semi rimless pair (thanks!) but he likes the bold ones!! ( i do too) which i am suprised as he said to avoid anything too bold!! lol...still getting used to them though, my left eye is better with glasses on but still really blurred...will this get better after time?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>princess</b>&nbsp;02 Sep 2010, 13:35</p><p>just to update, i decided to buy the frames that i linked up the other day,  they said it would take a week to come back so looks like i wont be picking them up until early next week :(  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2010, 00:45</p><p>princess </p><p>The main thing is that they aren't too wide on your face. Hopefully an optician will assist you in picking 2 that fit your face well.  </p><p>You are no different than so many others about feeling less than confident about wearing glasses. But I think you will quickly see the benefits working at your computer. You will quickly find your eyes wont feel as tired as your used to now. </p><p>Remember it is not at all unusual for people that work at computers all day to find glasses in their future. So I think you will find your work enviroment for your first step. After work, well it is best to get it over with right away. Just wear them bravely and after the first couple of days everyone will be used to seeing you wearing them and think nothing of it.  </p><p>There is really no way to tell you how long it will take for your distance vision to clear up with them. Every ones eyes are different, your eyes may adjust very quickly because your rx is not very strong. If I were to guess I would think that wearing them full time the blur should go away in a week or so. The blur wont be so bad that you can't see, but you will notice it.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>princess</b>&nbsp;27 Aug 2010, 16:59</p><p>thanks Soundmanpt </p><p> </p><p>i will be going into the store tomorrow to decide and then buy some (the 2 for 1 offer is in store) i have got to admit i am quite nerveous about wearing them...im not very confident..i wish i was confident..i like trendy glasses, i just hope they suit me...i use the computer alot so they will be used alot, ...how long does it take for distance vision to be clear?? do many people wear + for distance?....i think they take around 3-4 days before i get them...i will report back</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Aug 2010, 13:06</p><p>princess </p><p>Very nice! I think you may find at first the semi-rimless pair easier to use until you get used to wearing them. From your earlier posts you indicated that you have have been having trouble with your distant vision as well as close up so it sounds like your going to be wearing them full time. Remember as i'm sure you have read in here from others that your close vision will be much better from day one, but until your eyes adjust your distant vision will most likely be somewhat blurry with your glasses. This will slowly get better with each day that you wear them and soon your distant vision will be very clear as well. Your prescription is not very strong so it should not take long for your eyes to adjust for all distances.  </p><p>Do you have a job that requires a lot of close work? If so it should not take long at all for your eyes to adjust to glasses. Are you getting excited about getting and wearing glasses or are you more nervous about it?  </p><p>Will you be placing your order for your glasses on Saturday or did you already order them? Did they say when they will be ready to pickup?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Aug 2010, 08:43</p><p>princess </p><p>Only a few full plastic frames come with adjustable nose pads, most are fixed and cannot be adjusted to fit your nose. They are what they are. Semi-rimless frames have the adjustable nose pads and a good optician can easily adjust them to properly fit your nose. </p><p>Sounds like you are petite, it does seem like they don't make nearly enough smaller frames without shopping in the kids frames. So for you it's not just a matter of finding a style you like but also one's that fit your face.  </p><p>Good luck on Saturday finding just the right frames you will be happy with. I'm sure you will find what your after. </p><p>Let us know what you choose, maybe post pictures of the frames here.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>princess</b>&nbsp;26 Aug 2010, 03:10</p><p>i know exactly , me and my partner have different tastes, he recently convinced me to buy a watch that was different to the one i wanted, ultimately i ended up going back and buying the one i wanted...lol..girls know best then...yes i was looking for maybe a semi rimless pair but could only see ones that looked quite man-ly ...lol...i must have quite a small face as everything looks massive on me.... </p><p>does anyone find the glasses with the plastic bits that rest on the nose comfortable rather than plastic framed rests...i will have to give them a try, as i will be getting 2 pairs i wanted 2 different styles...i will let you know how i get on, going back on saturday to buy...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Aug 2010, 00:11</p><p>princess </p><p>Keep in mind that even more important than looks, be sure they feel comfortable to wear and that the frame is not a distraction to your eyes seeing proper. For a first wearer I often recommend something semi-rimless, less frame to distract. However if you pick a bigger plastic frame this should not be an issue for you.  </p><p>Also something I have found over the years, you are much better off getting your girlfriends opinion than your mother or a boyfriends. Look at it this way if you were going to purchase a purse or shoes would you want your mother or boyfriend's advice? Yeah I thought that's what you would say. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>princess</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2010, 16:48</p><p>thanks, yeah i know..i do like the bold black, but cant decide if they suit me, i need a buddy to come with me for a 2nd opinion...lol...might check out the browns, didnt fancy anything too colourful as i thought i would get bored quickly..?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2010, 15:59</p><p>Princess - I'm blonde too and have never felt that the black framed look suited me, it just seemed to harsh. I've had more luck, I think, with brown or bronze frames, and I had some blue frames too which were good. But I agree with Melyssa, it's not possible to generalise so you should try out as many as you can and see what suits you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2010, 14:55</p><p>Princess, </p><p> </p><p>Your question can have 142,857*7+1 answers to it, as I have read over the years (even today) that blondes should have dark frames, or light-colored frames, or medium even, and the same  seems to apply for brunettes like myself.  For the past 15-20 there has been little to choose from as far as colors, shapes, or sizes of frames, which is why I've kept my vast collection from the 1980s, be they blue, red, purple, clear, brown, or others. </p><p> </p><p>What you should do is try different color frames, even take a relative or friend or three with you to get opinions, and go with whatever you like best.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2010, 20:59</p><p>Princess, </p><p> </p><p>That is excellent. However, glaucoma can be present without either diabetes or high blood pressure. If there is any glaucoma in your family, be sure that you get a test at every eye exam and if the high internal pressures persist, you might consider seeing an opthalmologist who specializes in glaucoma, for a very through exam. </p><p> </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>princess</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2010, 12:01</p><p>thanks Cactus Jack, you seem really clued up....my blood pressure is sometimes quite low but the doctor said it was fine (within a good range) my partner has high blood pressure we have got a blood pressure monitor at home so i do check it every now and then....i also had a test for diabetes a few months ago and it came back fine</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2010, 06:18</p><p>Princess, </p><p>As Phil said, the air puff test is used to measure internal pressures in the eye.  The air puff test is essentially a "screening" test that is easily and quickly done in opticians and optometrists offices.   </p><p>There are other ways to measure the pressure using instruments that physically touch the cornea.  These types of tests require the use of mild anesthetic drops in the eye so you don't feel the instrument touching the cornea.  These tests that touch the cornea are considered more accurate and are typically used by Opthalmologists. </p><p>Excessive pressure is mostly caused by glaucoma which is in turn caused by the fluid drainage system in the eye not working properly, but it can also be caused by high blood pressure.  Excessive internal pressure can ultimately cause damage to the retina and high blood pressure can cause other serious damage to the body.  Both can be controlled by medication when it becomes a problem. </p><p>The eyes have been called windows into the body and many health problems are first discovered during an eye exam by measuring the internal pressure and/or inspecting the retina with a retinoscope.  A significant part of the training of Eye Care Professionals is spent teaching them to recognize not only early signs of diseases of the eye, but also diseases that primarily affect other parts of the body.  Diabetes comes to mind as one of the diseases that are not directly eye related, but can cause damage to the eyes.  Early signs of diabetes, when it is most easily controlled and managed, are often discovered during eye exams when there are no obvious other symptoms. </p><p>I don't mention all the above with the intent to scare you, only to make you and other members aware of some of the other ancillary benefits of regular eye exams.  If you get an opportunity, you might do a quick blood pressure check.  Many pharmacies (chemists?) have automated machines that check blood pressure for free and it only takes a few seconds.  If you blood pressure is out of normal ranges, high or low, over a period of several weeks, it deserves further investigation.  One check is not definitive because BP is highly variable depending on what you have been doing and your emotional state. </p><p>BTW, I have type 2 diabetes and accompanying high blood pressure.  First clues to both were noted during eye exams over 40 years ago. Subsequent medical exams confirmed that both were in their very early "silent" stages.  I began to follow medical advice on early non-medication control methods and later by prescription medication.  I am now nearly 73, have no retinal damage, my primary doctor recently said I had the blood chemistry of an 18 YO, and am able to do almost anything I want to - including contributing to Eyescene on occasion. </p><p>C.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2010, 04:34</p><p>Princess, The "puff" test is for glaucoma, or raised pressure in the eye. Do you have any history of it in your family? If the optician had been seriously concerned (s)he would have referred you to your doctor. My readings are almost always near the top of the range; but they don't seem to get worse.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>princess</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2010, 04:07</p><p>thanks so much x </p><p> </p><p>just out of interest, when i had the test where they do a 'puff of air ' into the eye, what  is that for? i had to repeat this lots of times (they done about 10 puffs in each eye b4 ok'ing it, the reading was quite high so they sent me back again after my eye test to do another reading, they said i had alot of pressure in my eyes? anyone else get this too?  </p><p> </p><p>does anyone know the science behind this? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2010, 02:10</p><p>Princess, That's a pretty light prescription. You won't find the lenses distorting or ugly. If you get some nice frames you may well end up enjoying wearing them. And I suspect that, as well as feeling more comfortable and having clearer vision, you will attract lots of (positive) compliments on how you look in them. Give it a go. And let us know how you get on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2010, 16:18</p><p>princess, </p><p>I'm operating on very limited information, but it sounds like you may be a latent hyperope and you are beginning to develop some presbyopia.  If you have blurry distance vision without any correction, it sounds like you are having trouble accommodating to compensate for your hyperopia and if you are having some pain and excess fatigue when reading or doing other close work that is also a sign that you are having trouble accommodating even more. </p><p>The symptoms you describe are not unusual and it is likely that within a few months after starting to wear glasses, you will need increased plus in your glasses as your ciliary muscles and crystaline lenses relax.  You probably should wear the new glasses full time for at least a month to see if your distance vision starts to clear up with the glasses and the pain either goes away or diminishes, before making the decision to wear them part time.  I would suggest waiting until your Rx settles down before considering contacts. </p><p>With that Rx, you should get Rx glasses made, but if you want to experiment, you can try wearing some +1.50 over-the-counter reading glasses and see what kind of difference they make.  If you know or are willing to measure your PD (Pupilary Distance) you can easily order that Rx at low cost, from an on line retailer. </p><p>Am I correct in assuming that the blurry distance vision is without correction and the pain occurs when you read or use a computer at close distances? </p><p>May I ask where you live? </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>I, Glasses</b>&nbsp;13 Aug 2010, 10:23</p><p>While looking for frames online recently, I ran across a Web site for 'Trufocals,' glasses that can be 'tuned' to specific focal lengths.  They're a little funky looking, but not too bad; and the concept is great.  You may want to take a look.  The Web site is www.trufocals.com</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Daniel</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2010, 21:43</p><p>Most probably my problem started by wearing contacts for 16 or 17 hours a day, and no glasses at all. Now I have to throw some glasses time every day. </p><p>Do you have any photos of your real glasses, I mean with ur lenses and all?</p><p></p><hr>

I went to the eye doctor </p><p>and she noticed first capillaries growing on my iris and recommended me wearing glasses at least for three days a week. </p><p>I read about different contact lenses and found out that I wore old fashioned lenses with almost no permeability for oxygen. </p><p>Mine had a Dk/t (oxygen permeability) of about 20 and today you can get Air Optix Aqua with a Dk/t of 175.  </p><p>I tried different lenses, also  </p><p>Air Optix but ended up with Bausch &amp; Lomb Pure Vision (Dk/t 110).

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2010, 11:36</p><p>Daniel - I have a good friend who's about -4. Since she converted from RPGs to soft lenses about 3 years ago I never see here wear glasses, even if we go on holiday together for a week. It drives me crazy that she finds them so comfortable for 15 hours every day, 7 days a week. She's worn them for 25 years or so, which is great for her but I wonder what the secret is - I have days when my contacts are really uncomfortable. I wonder why some people can tolerate them, literally, for years and others - like us - get more sensitive to them? The answer would be worth a ££ or two!</p><p></p><hr>

My Rx is around -4 now with a fair amount of astigmatism. My bf currently wears rimless with titanium arms/bridge due to nickel allergy. He looks fantastic in them but they are getting a bit tired so he is on the hunt for something similar - but there really are none out there! As for me, I am frustrated that I can't get on with rimless as they really do suit me. I am currently wearing semi rimless and when I tried plastic on he didn't like the look of any of them saying it detracts from the rest of my face. For that reason i'd held off ordering anything plastic from zenni as I just wasn't sure what would suit. So I am on the hunt for something stylish in semi-rimless again, as lightweight as possible and would get them glazed with at least 1.6 lenses. I need something practical and durable as i'm a Dr and its not been unknown for my glasses to drop off whilst bending over! </p><p> </p><p>On another note, does anyone here know if you really can get transitions lenses in drill mounted rimless specs? </p><p> </p><p>Katie 8-)</p><p></p><hr>

I am really averse to plastic chunky frames because I have pale skin and reddish hair making really bold frames too much. Be both tried on loads of frame and found zero suitable. Neither of us found any which we felt looked good and attractive on one another.

<p><b>Amy</b>&nbsp;10 Oct 2009, 03:57</p><p>There seem to be some really nice frames around to choose from at the moment. Bigger than they have been for a long time which actually gives you much wider vision especially when you are dependent on glasses like me. My last pair were plastic semi rimless in a nice petrol blue with quite wide arms but this time I've gone for a bigger full plastic frame in a rectangular shape and really wide arms.

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2009, 09:47</p><p>As a man I would choose the frost-look. The polished lenses look a bit too glammorous for me. </p><p>Besides that, you should think about the light coming in through the sides of the lenses when they're polished. I don't know if that leads to more reflections but maybe someone who has polished sides can tell.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2009, 11:20</p><p>Millhouse - I have some rimless glasses and the edges are polished. It's a nice effect, looks like you take the trouble to consider the small detail - but mine are only -3 and -2.75 so not sure how the polished edges would work with a stronger Rx.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2009, 07:33</p><p>Back to the subject title, I was at my regular glasses place recently, getting my pretty powder-blue drop-temples fixed, and a saleswoman was there with her humongous suitcase, showing the manager a bunch of, unfortunately, little frames, in plastic, metal, and semi-rimless.  The manager, whose name is pronounced exactly like mine only with 2 different letters in her name, tried a lot of them on, but I couldn't see her staring up close at the mirror because of the saleswoman's positioning.  Anyway, when the latter was leaving with her suitcase, I smiled at her and touched my frame.  She said, "I like those," and left.  I then said to the manager, "I hope she got the hint."  Only time will tell.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2009, 18:02</p><p>My experience is completely the reverse :) Women tend to be so insecure about their appearance that they just love compliments - whether on a dress, glasses or whatever. My GWG gfs have all been delighted with my approval, and if they don't wear glasses all the time have frequently worn them just to please me - or when they are feeling horny in the certain knowledge that they will get me going that way:) Pete</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Henry</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2009, 12:28</p><p>My personal experience is, that every girlfriend of mine who knew about me having the OO-thing, thought im weird and sonner or later the relationship broke up because of this. So I swore to me to never tell it anyone again. </p><p>A rare exception could occur when I would accidently learn that my gf is a OO, too. That would be cool to share experiences. :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2009, 11:51</p><p>Katy, I would love an OO gf. It's my fetish that makes me want a relationship outside my marriage. It's so exciting being able to share how one feels with someone who doesn't disapprove and who one can be open with.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2009, 11:40</p><p>Phil - my last boyfriend went along with my OOness quite happily but wasn't an OO himself. I did have a previous boyfriend who was into S&amp;M;, which I think is a similar thing (helplessness/vulnerability etc) - although I know that is a controversial thing to say on here. I would like to meet an OO, but at the same time I'd like to try what VFL has talked about and meet someone with glasses but keep quiet about the OO stuff - because when they know about it, it affects how they act, and you don't know how much of the squinting etc is for real. I don't know how long I could keep quiet for though!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2009, 01:24</p><p>I'll take that as a compliment Katy. If only my charms paid dividends! I thought that you had a BF with OO inclinations at one point. I find it hard not to be able to chat openly about my interests. My wife would have me certified if she knew. I've kept my "thing" for girls in glasses a secret for about 40 years now! </p><p>Those specs sound good Clare. I would resurrect them and see what reactions you get!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2009, 13:47</p><p>Okay Phil, I agree I'm serious in a professional but not geeky sense - whatever that means!  </p><p> </p><p>Katy - as for rimless, I had some 5 years ago and I got lots of compliments. I still have them and could wear them but somehow they don't seem to look right anymore. I really liked them at the time - they have angular rectangle shaped lenses and a pale blue metalic frame, but they just seem to look a bit bland now. </p><p> </p><p>Some people - never satisfied eh?!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2009, 11:39</p><p>Ha ha Phil what a charmer! Yes the compliments have come from non-OO people.. I don't know any OOs apart from on here!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2009, 05:43</p><p>Katy, I've heard other very beautiful women say that about rimless specs. I wonder whether some people may feel a bit "naked" or vulnerable with them. In fact I think they hardly ever look awful, not least because they accentuate the lenses and the eyes behind them. I think they can look stunning, particularly with crisp new minus lenses. </p><p>I'm glad that the new frames are being well-received. Is this in the "real" world? Or are you still moving in OO circles?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2009, 10:46</p><p>Hi Phil, rimless don't suit me at all for some reason. I've had a couple of nice comments so far. It's great to have some different ones!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2009, 05:52</p><p>Katy, you'd need black frames to wear with them! Any comments yet? You must have quite a collection of frames now. Have you ever tried rimless or colourless plastic?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2009, 05:41</p><p>Yes just picked them up - they look great, but I have very quickly discovered that I can't wear purple or pink tops with them! They have the -2 rx I got a few weeks ago. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2009, 04:15</p><p>Clare, you ARE serious! But what's wrong with that? We OOs are surely into the glasses "thing", at least in part, because we are attracted to intelligent members of the opposite sex. Glasses don't look as good on "bimbos" as on a clever-looking woman. That's why there's nowhere like Oxford for yummy gwg-spotting!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2009, 04:12</p><p>Have you got the new glasses Katy? How do they look? What rx have you got in the new frames?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2009, 11:52</p><p>Katy - I love bronze too, I have a pair but think they make me look a bit geeky! I'll see if I can find the FCUK pair online, they're nearly 3 years old now so maybe old stock!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2009, 11:48</p><p>Clare, I've gone for the bronze in the CK frames as those were the ones I first saw (for over £200!) in the shop. The purple ones look gorgeous too but the Roxy ones are purple (look more pink in the photo) &amp; I want a few different colours! Yours sound really nice.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2009, 11:42</p><p>Katy - I love the CK frames, what colour - purple? My frames are FCUK, slightly angular, metal in a dark purple/brown colour. I like them but I think they make me look a bit serious!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2009, 11:38</p><p>Ooh I am excited, got 2 new pairs on the way now!

Picking them up tomorrow, can't wait! :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2009, 12:38</p><p>To me, "bling" brings to mind jewelry.  And with glasses, jewelry brings to mind rhinestones on the cat's-eyes that were around before my time.  Hmmm -- frames with real jewels on them -- emeralds, rubies, sapphires, etc.  I'd need a full-time bodyguard to wear them in public.  :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2009, 12:22</p><p>Clare, I'm confident about wearing them as in I wear them all the time, and I have one pair at the moment that I really like, it's just hard to find others, and I'd like to have a few to swap around. I do have quite a collection but most of them I wouldn't wear any more. I liked my Specsavers fcuk ones til they mangled them!  :-( What frames have you got at the moment?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2009, 11:34</p><p>Katy - I know what you mean, I feel the same that nothing really suits me. I thought you were quite confident about your looks with glasses? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2009, 11:08</p><p>Thanks for the opinions, I might go for those after all. It's just that the letters are made of little fake diamonds.. not half as bad as a lot that are around at the moment I suppose. Clare, I know what you mean -   I think with me the problem is that hardly any frames suit me, whereas some people look great in all of them. Hoping to go in tomorrow and choose some before Specsavers change their mind!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2009, 01:34</p><p>Katy, As usual, EHPC's judgement is spot on. You would look stunning in them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2009, 12:22</p><p>Katy - I don't think those frames could be remotely described as 'bling'. Don't go for the drabness of English understatement......................:)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2009, 11:20</p><p>Katy - I always have the same problem, I really can't find (and never have found) anything I geniunely like. There are those I see in the shop, and subsequently buy, but later I wonder if they were a good choice, which is probably why I never feel completely comfortable or attractive wearing them. </p><p>I'm working somewhere at the moment where there are lots of gwgs, and they're big on the bling.

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2009, 11:15</p><p>The other day I took a 3 year old pair of glasses to Specsavers to have them straighten the arms, and they slightly mangled them - they put a couple of dents in one arm.

<p><b>DWV</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2009, 23:26</p><p>You know, there are these things called digital cameras.  You may have heard of them?  It's pretty easy to take a self-portrait while trying on frames.  Then you can see what you look like, and ask friends/family/pets/creepy-strangers-on-the-internet which frames make you look hotter or smarter.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2009, 12:42</p><p>Yes it is very difficult trying on frames when you don't have prescription lenses in them.  As I stated some time ago on (probably) another thread, it's best to take along a friend, or have one of the salespeople model the frame(s) you like, which is how I got my first drop-temples.  The young lady was very helpful, and even though she was blonde (not necessarily for real), I was able to see the beauty of the frames themselves.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2009, 11:29</p><p>Melyssa. The plastic colours now are really subtle sometimes. There's so much choice it's brilliant. Another girl I saw today that looked to be pretty high minus had soem blue and white frames and they looked really attractive. She was ginger too. LOL I just can't make up my mind what to have next. I keep going into the high street opticians and trying on lots of different colours, but it's so hard seeing myself unless I get close up to the mirror. Then I don't get the overall effect properly. It's kind of a problem deciding.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2009, 07:50</p><p>Rachel, </p><p> </p><p>Those frames did start out like the color of a clear sky (not that we get any of those around here), and are somewhat lighter.  I also have a 22-year-old frame (the modified cat's-eye pair that's purple at the top, clear at the bottom) that originally was blue, and now there are some red streaks in it.  Go figure.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2009, 09:49</p><p>Melyssa, Yeah I know they did look really nice. Kind of soft looking and all that. Glad you think the same. Like yors will have faded with age maybe. LOL</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2009, 07:25</p><p>Rachel, </p><p> </p><p>My favorite top-temples are basically that color, and seem to have gotten lighter than their original color in the 22 years and 8 days that I've owned them.  It's nice to know that there still are some frames in colors are than black, brown, and gold.  (That's all I seem to see people wearing in this part of the universe.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2009, 05:58</p><p>Darker blue is better for blondes in my view. Everyone's individual preference, one doesn't need to add, but as a big blonde GWG appreciater that is my preference.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2009, 04:17</p><p>Melyssa. I saw a girl about 20 in some nice Pale Blue Plastic frames this moring with plus lenses. They looked really nice on her and she was blonde. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;10 Jul 2009, 14:42</p><p>You are cool, Rachel :) Colours can be great but black is very special :) Pete</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;10 Jul 2009, 12:39</p><p>Rachel, </p><p> </p><p>About half of my frames are in bold colors (blue, red, purple), with the others being black, brown, clear, etc.  I don't know how lens thickness goes with frame color, as for me it's frame size.  My two biggest frames, both drop-temples, are a blue one and a brown one.  It would be really cool to have a frame with all 7 colors of the rainbow. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;10 Jul 2009, 04:22</p><p>Melyssa. I think this thread is better for what we are dicussing. I know what you mean about colours. Some of the new frames look really cool in Black and Yellow. That's nice for blonde hair. I saw some in yellow and blue this morning and they looked really nice on this girl that was wearing them, but her lenses weren't at all strong at all. So maybe they suited weak lenses. I think if you need strong lenses maybe bolder colurs are better or the thickness looks pretty obvious. I think I'll stick to either black or brown next time I choose some.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 05:12</p><p>Aubrac/Martyn. I reckon you are both about right. -7.00 is about the limit for rimless glasses by all accounts. After that you will get the usual garbage like "Well with your latest prescription change, it may not be very advisable to choose rimless glasses now. Why not consider some of these new plastic designer frames? They are all the fashion, bla, bla bla." In other words your lenses are now much too thick for rimless glasses now, or they would look hideous. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Martyn</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 04:20</p><p>Rachel, the only time i have known when opticians will not give the client what they want is rimless glasses after a certain thickness of lens, not be cause screws are not long enough, the thickness of the lens MAY NOT BE SUITABLE , yet i have seen very thick rimless glasses. I think thick lenses are better in frames, that s just my opinion.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 03:52</p><p>Must agree with Rachel, I've had -5.00 rimless for years, and also seen many pairs for sale on Ebay up to -6.00.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 03:13</p><p>Puffin. That's rubbish about not being able to get screws long enough. I had metal frames when I was -7.00 and the screws weren't a problem at all. The main thing is getting frames with enough depth on the hinges to take the lens thickness at the back, so the arms will close.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 02:59</p><p>Melyssa. I suppose so but, hum, I'm not all that nuts on huge frames like you are. Like I think these cool metal frames look really good especially with thick lenses. Not too small though, round look ever so wacky I think.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2009, 15:29</p><p>I'm sure I've seen rimless about -3 to -6 or so in my time. Apparently they have trouble getting the screws long enough (or something).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Menthe</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2009, 15:17</p><p>Does anyone know of a chart which lists lens edge thickness for a given diameter of lens against different scripts?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Traveller</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2009, 14:24</p><p>Interestingly a number of optical chains in the UK won't do rimless with standard lenses above about -1.5 because of the "high prescription" LOL Apparently they are concerned about cracking. </p><p> </p><p>I once knew a girl with fairly standard -7 lenses in a rimless design and she looked great with them. I'm fairly sure this is another sales ploy but I understand that it wouldn't be everyone's choice. </p><p> </p><p>I have a pair of rimless (-3) with hi-index lenses but I much prefer my cheap full frame metal pair with CR39. OK they stick out a little at the back (3mm)but who cares. I feel that I have better vision with them and even with a modest prescription that is what matters.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2009, 11:45</p><p>Rachel, </p><p> </p><p>That sounds like an interesting idea.  And on the other side of it, you could try to find a real large pair of sunglasses and have them made up with clear lenses in your prescription.  The thickness should really bring out the "referee" (as all are blind) effect. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2009, 08:58</p><p>Melyssa. Yeah my lenses are totally flat at the front now. To be honest I wouldn't mind some spare glasses with metal frames to wear when I want to go out looking really blind...lol. Sounds stupid I know, buts its a real laugh I think.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2009, 07:26</p><p>Rachel, </p><p> </p><p>Good points.  Where I get my glasses done, the thickest parts of my lenses are towards the back of the frame, as the fronts of the lenses are almost flat.  And of course, the thickness of my lenses is yet another reason why I won't wear metal or rimless frames -- aesthetics, and heaviness of the lenses relative to the frames. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2009, 02:12</p><p>Melyssa. All the same when your lenses get thick you need to be careful what type of frames you choose. Most good optical techicians can set the thickness of the lenses at the back of the frames, but I have seen some youngsters wearing glasses that are really bad examples of workmanship. Like metal frames from chain opticians where the lenses are just set in the middle of them and stick out both at the back and the front if they are very myopic. The same with plus lenses. Lots of lens jutting out at the front of the frames. It all depends where you go for your glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2009, 07:50</p><p>Rachel, </p><p> </p><p>I'd say the lenses were of medium thickness.  Anyone I've ever seen with thick lenses has had them fully inside the frame -- even that famous Glasses Girl I see several times a day (in the mirror, of course).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2009, 00:47</p><p>Melyssa. So were they pretty thick then?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2009, 12:40</p><p>Rachel, </p><p> </p><p>I know what you mean.  I'd be a tad uneasy with "floating lenses."  But in the woman's case, her lenses were fully attached to the frame.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2009, 23:06</p><p>Melyssa.  </p><p>Yeah we have had those type of wide sides over here. Were the lenses like what we call floating? Not fixed to any of the frame down the sides? They look cool but are no good for thick lenses. lol</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2009, 12:43</p><p>Rachel, </p><p> </p><p>Small metal frames are still quite common in the U.S., as we seem to be the last to get anything.  Maybe everything goes in time zone order.  LOL </p><p> </p><p>I saw a woman wearing a wide-side frame today, but instead of one big solid piece, it was like 2 parallel pieces from one end to the other, giving a new meaning to split-temple frames. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2009, 01:40</p><p>Melyssa. </p><p> </p><p>Yeah I know what you mean. Some of them feel really tight when you try them on. The sides actually do block out any peripheral vision, but only if you can see something without looking through your lenses!! Like there's no way I can any way so it doesn't really matter. I used to wear very small metal frames about 3 or 4 years ago. They seem really dated now don't they.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2009, 12:49</p><p>Rachel, </p><p> </p><p>I think a lot of those wide-side frames look nice, especially the more colorful ones, but they're a bit too narrow between the sides to fit me (thus far).  Also, I have a friend who won't wear hers when driving because they block her peripheral vision.  So, whenever she comes over she has on her teeny tiny rimless glasses. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2009, 11:32</p><p>Too right Rachel :) They are the coolest :) Pete</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2009, 22:32</p><p>Melyssa. Don't you like these latest plastic frames with wide sides? They are quit thick plastic ones here in the UK in all sorts of cool trendy colours.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2009, 12:43</p><p>Rachel, </p><p> </p><p>Actually, cat's-eyes and butterflies are not exactly the same.  Lisa Loeb has worn both shapes, having worn more angled cat's-eyes long ago and less angled more recently.  As long as the frame is large enough so that each lens measures at least 2 inches in any direction, I'd take either style.  I really want a blue cat's-eye frame the most. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2009, 12:04</p><p>Melyssa. That's probably the "correct" name for what I mean by butterfly. lol. Do you really like them? I have actually seen pics of my aunt wearing them when she was at school too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2009, 12:49</p><p>Rachel J, </p><p> </p><p>I reckon this is the best place to discuss frames, I reckon.  LOL </p><p> </p><p>I'm not really sure about the time "frame" of butterfly frames, but sharp-angled cat's-eyes, of which I have three pairs, was practically the only style women had in the 1950s and 1960s.  In grade school, I remember three girls who wore cat's-eyes -- one with a blue frame, one pink, and one white.  As late as 1971, there were still two other girls in my school with cat's-eyes.  All of my current ones I bought as sunglasses, then had clear prescription lenses put in them. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel J</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2009, 23:15</p><p>Melyssa. </p><p> </p><p>I reckon we should be in this thread discussing frames don't you?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>I, Glasses</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2009, 09:08</p><p>Otto, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks.  Yours is just the type of advice I was looking for.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>OttO</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2009, 08:38</p><p>I, Glasses </p><p>In my opinion you can't beat the Artcraft Rimways (same as Shuron Ronwinne).  I've been wearing them for more than ten years and am completely satisfied with them. Like you say, Rimways (which are semi-rimless drill mount glasses) have the over-arching wire frame and so are considerably more durable than the three piece glasses which have only the bridge to hold them together.  I've read a number of times that the three-piece glasses break pretty easily; and that's why I've never tried the style although I've considered them.  I've got the Rimways with the cable temples and find them to be lightweight, and comfortable as well as durable.  Since they are a "traditional" style I never need to be concerned that they won't be available 6 months or 3 years from now like whatever style is fashionable at the moment! Since the Rimways are drill-mounts I would suggest finding a local optician with some experience with them for your first pair as adjustments and repairs can be a bit tricky.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>I, Glasses</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2009, 07:46</p><p>I'm seeking advice from experienced rimless wearers before I make a purchase.  Is either of these styles more or less satisfactory -- the three-piece rimless, or the type with the over-arching wire frame, e.g., the Artcraft Rimway -- or does it really make a difference in such things as their comfort, fit, durability, etc.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2009, 02:29</p><p>Some of the modern narrow styles work quite well with myodisks, because instead of a ring you can get away with just a line - depending on your prescription of course.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>norman</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2008, 12:47</p><p>Millhouse.  I have a high prescription like yours and ten to wear specs with wide arms because they cleverly hide the lens thickness.

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2008, 09:54</p><p>Millhouse - semi-rimless are still en vogue so I don't think you can go wrong there. The wide arms are merely an extra detail so I wouldn't worry. Far better to have something that suits rather than choose a style just because it seems popular. Why follow the herd? Make your own look!</p><p></p><hr>

The frames were not always in black though, most I remember were a nickel colour with pink, black or blue bits covering the wire temples and of course the springy curved earpieces. They were much more resilient than those awful plastic things that followed them, they seemed almost indestructable, if they got damaged, they were simply bent back into shape again, I can recall someone at school with a safety pin being used as an inprovised hinge screw!! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2006, 16:28</p><p>maxine </p><p>If I understand you aright, these black round wire frames with metal hinges, similar to the NHS childen's specs of the 1950s,came back into fashion for a while about 10 years ago, at least in Britain. Does no-one still make them?  Or is that not what you're looking for?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxine</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2006, 12:14</p><p>Hi Chris </p><p>        Thanks for your help, but I am still struggling to find the frames I want, all the sites, e-bay etc all seem to have the plastic type that came in a range of colours, and were often "customised" with a wildly contrasting colour of sticky tape, train spotter types were the best at this!!. Surely with the amount of these frames that must have been produced from the launch of the NHS in the late 1940s, to the last time I can recall seeing a pair some 20 years later on a  girl who started secondary school a couple of years after me, some must have survived. Come on everyone check those attics!! </p><p>             Maxine</p><p></p><hr>

The metal ones are still available, but god knows where from. The late TV celebrity, Fred Dibnah, wore a pair ,in keeping with his love for ancient things.

<p><b>Sandy</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2005, 04:41</p><p>Melyssa, </p><p>I teach my clients to think of glasses as a fashion accessory, not a clinical thing. Yes, I match my glasses to my clothing also, and one great pair of glasses I found has  mottled colors in bright magenta, purple and green. They go with nearly everything. Every time I wear them I'm asked, "Where did you get them?" Red glasses get the same response. </p><p> </p><p>Sandy</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2005, 08:11</p><p>Sandy, </p><p> </p><p>I do have many glasses besides brown ones, including several pairs of blue, red, purple, and clear.  I try to match frames with my outfits (or vice-versa) most of the time.  I guess you could call my glasses a "necessary accessory," which make me see better and look better.  And you're right -- color is the best way, but it's almost impossible to find frames in nice colors or styles these days, so I go with the tried-and true. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sandy</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2005, 05:22</p><p>Melyssa, </p><p>Read your comments. I'm not a fashion expert as much as I am a color expert. Biggest mistake men make in choosing ties is winding up with an absolute lack of contrast (it says "boring"); i.e., blue suit, blue tie (President Bush...). Same is true with glasses. Go for contrast with the color of your eyes, and glasses will be your friend; burgundy frames will make blue eyes look more blue, for example. With brown eyes, you will probably want them to appear darker and more dark and "bedroomy" - do that by wearing light "tortoise" lenses (since you like brown). Purple frames tend to make brown eyes look more pale, but they are a natural complement to the color brown - and they look fashionable. Rule Number One with glasse: Make them a fashion accessory instead of a clinical-looking instrument! Color is the best way. </p><p>Sandy Dumont </p><p>The Image Architect</p><p></p><hr>

When the kid was approaching the lively stage of snatching dad's specs off and throwing them about his father changed over from ordinary wire frames to hingeless rimless as being more robust.

<p><b>Sandy</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2004, 06:26</p><p>Hi Matthew, I have a pair like that. It is a titanium rimless frame by Silhouette.  There are no hinges in the frame.  It is a very delicate frame, so the eye doctor gives you instructions on how to handle them.  I ended up getting polycarbonate lenses with anti-reflective lenses on them.  They are very light and invisible.  I have also seen a pair by Marchon called airlock frames.  The cheapest place that I have seen those are on e-bay.  I ended up getting my from the eye doctor and it cost over $450 for the frames and lenses and a 10-day wait because they had to send the glasses out to an outside lab.  Take care. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Matthew</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2004, 14:38</p><p>Two questions relating to the current style in rimless frames which I'd really like to try (fully rimless, not semi), are they as sturdy as normal frames, i.e. not likely to break, and can anyone give me a brand name or source to get them at a sensible price? Low prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;14 Aug 2004, 06:54</p><p>This has come up in chat and e-mail a number of times actually.

And he really looked like a big old shmo - a guy you'd expect to be selling you aluminum siding or something.  </p><p>But recently, he finally got a new pair, nothing earth shattering, just a smaller, more contemporary roundish oval shape with a thin tortise shell frame, and I swear it looked like he lost 30lbs overnight.

Only at close range can you even see the lens and even then the rectangular lens doesn't look that bad.  I'm very satisfied with Optical4less.  It even came with a free case and cleaning cloth.  My glasses have gotten dirty though and I need to pick up some lens cleaner :(  These glasses look fantastic though.  Nearly invisible, almost light, and they make me look more intelligent (great for job interviews!) :)  Cost me $50 for the glasses + $50 for the sunglasses clip-on (my eyes are very sensitive to light).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Big  Al</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2004, 13:54</p><p>Hi everyone, does anyone know where I can get rimless glasses in an aviator shape with a bar across the top of the lenses? I would like rimless aviators, but no one seems to make the bar, surely it is not difficult to flatten a small piece of wire at both ends and drill mount it to the top of the lenses,in the same manner as the temples and nosepiece. There was someone on here some time ago that wanted a bigger lens size, and I would need the same thing, I fancy rimless glasses but the lenses are always too small to look good on me.  </p><p>                       Big Al</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>angie</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2003, 19:16</p><p>do you have any more info on how doing close work (reading, etc.) with glasses on increases myopia?  i've noticed that when i read close or take notes with my glasses on for an extended period--15 minutes or more--when i finally look up everything is slightly blurry and i have to work to focus.  i've actually taken to removing my glasses during classes where i read or write a lot, but that's inconvenient.  (and a very odd feeling, btw.  i feel so naked without them!  and it's so weird to be able to touch my face directly without glasses in the way!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>D-W-V</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2003, 14:26</p><p>In a way it's a good thing if she doesn't wear her glasses full-time: there's a theory (and some research that supports it) that wearing glasses with a myopic correction for close work like reading actually encourages the myopia to increase.  Not all eye doctors agree with this theory, but those that do would probably prescribe glasses with a reading addition for young people who wore glasses full-time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amber</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2003, 12:51</p><p>Alan, I'll certainly make a point of getting her new glasses in the new year after her next appointment.  If you were to ask me to classify her, I wouldnt be overly extreme on either end, but she spends a considerable amount of time practicing in the school band with her violin.  She is into looking for new clothes frequently, but she's not as radical about change in other aspects.  I think you're right though in that she'd probably be more self-conscious of the matter if she wore them full-time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2003, 04:38</p><p>Amber - The larger size might be "less disorienting", but I don't think this would be a major factor. </p><p> </p><p>If her prescription is close to -3, I'm surprised she doesn't wear them more.  I don't know if you can talk openly with her about things like this.  -3 is a prescription where most people wear glasses or contacts pretty much full time.  (My thought is that it's possible that she doesn't mind wearing them some of the time, but she'd be embarrassed to wear them all of the time. This might not be the case, but it seems like a possibility.) </p><p> </p><p>What "social category" does she fit into -- I mean, is she one of the "cool kids", a "nerd", "artsy type", etc?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>D-W-V</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2003, 17:32</p><p>I never much liked that style, except in much smaller sizes and in nearly transparent colours  ...although Bailey _did_ look awfully good in them on WKRP.   </p><p>At 14 she must be ready for something more stylish; there's an infinite number of better-looking frames out there, and they don't have to be expensive: check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210093058/http://www.39dollarglasses.com/" target="_blank">http://www.39dollarglasses.com</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160210093058/http://www.glassesamerica.com/" target="_blank">http://www.glassesamerica.com</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amber</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2003, 17:07</p><p>She has basically had these frames ever since she was 11 (she's now 14).  Alan, although I realize that they're not as prominent as they were before, I still see them in many opticals.  Basically, she doesn't wear them all the time (just for TV's and chalkboards perhaps).  Her prescription is a little under -3, and I'm also bringing it up because she hasn't ever really complained about them. </p><p> </p><p>As far as I can remember, I think the doctor recommended way back when that something larger would not be as disorienting. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2003, 14:02</p><p>Amber - I'm actually sort of surprised that you can find glasses like these.  Anyway, I think it's safe to say that most of her peers would find these glasses very much out-of-style.  You'll get very different opinions from other people here on this site (many of whom are very fold of the larger glasses styles fashionable in the past).  Personally - while I think glasses like these are kind of cute on young girls - as far as actually being flattering, I am pretty sure it would be very easy to do much, much better.   </p><p> </p><p>What's the history of these glasses of your daughter's?

<p><b>D-W-V</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2003, 13:49</p><p>Re: Cylinder, Axis, Prism and Add </p><p> </p><p>Cylinder and Axis describe the correction of astigmatism.  You can leave those at zero, but AFAIK it's unusual to have a prescription without some cylinder.  "Add" is the "reading addition" for bifocals or reading glasses, generally only prescribed for folks over 40.  It's generally between +1 and +3, identical for both eyes.  If you wanted to experiment with bifocals, +1 is barely worth bothering with (unless you actually need it), +2 or higher is noticable. </p><p> </p><p>How about going to an optometrist, preferably one that also sells eyeglasses (so he'll have a financial interest in giving you a prescription and selling you some outrageously priced frames and lenses), and say you're getting eyestrain while reading, or have trouble driving at night.  I doubt that any set of eyeballs are perfect (although many are "good enough"), so you're bound to get some kind of prescription, maybe only a diopter or less of sphere with a fraction of a diopter of cylinder. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Scotsman</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2003, 15:31</p><p>Hi everyone </p><p>Can anyone tell me where I can get rimless frames that look good on a broad head, I've tried loads of places, but the lenses always seem too small, and they dont make blanks big enough to suit bigger features. There was someone on this site a while ago who wanted thicker lenses, does anyone know where I can get BIGGER ones?. I would be grateful for help on this matter. </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>angie</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2003, 21:20</p><p>lore, where do you shop?  lol.  i know at the place where i go, a lot of the stylish lenses are actually unisex, and it's just a matter of choosing a style that suits your face.  and then there's a nice selection for men too.  in fact, i think the women kind of get shafted there because men can use the unisex frames or the frames meant for men, but the womens-only frames tend to be kind of cheesy (like cat eyes with rhinestones or weird floral print wires).   </p><p> </p><p>it makes me sad when people wear glasses that are bad for their face...  lol</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2003, 08:05</p><p>I totally disagree about it being easier for a guy to look good in glasses.  I like guys in glasses, but I think it's much harder for them to get good-looking frames.  While women have a *huge* selection of sylish frames, most men seem stuck with tons of old-fashioned aviators (which do NOT look good on anyone under about 40, IMHO), huge round circles (which are also not a particularly good choice), or ultra-ultra-hip plastic frames.  There's very little in between.  Last time my husband got glasses, we had so much trouble finding him a pair!  He ended up with a really nice pair of sort-of-rectangular-sort-of-square silver metal frames, which are not too big but not tiny, either, but it was a struggle to fine them!  Out of the probably 300 pairs of men's glasses in Lenscrafters, those were the *only* ones we thought were not either way too old-fashioned or way too hip. </p><p> </p><p>It's so much easier for women.  In the same store, I saw probably 50 or more pairs of women's glasses that I thought were fabulous.  That's not to say they'd all look good on me, but there are tons of nice frames for women that are neither too old-fashioned, too plain, or too ultra-hip.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2003, 06:51</p><p>Clare -- I think the point is just that men tend to be a lot more boring in their fashion, and therefore can be a lot more boring in their glasses buying. </p><p> </p><p>I had my hair cut really short this summer and notices that the black plastic framed glasses I'd been wearing all the time really looked out of proportion.  I guess since standards of looking good are also lower for men, it really didn't matter much.   </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, as far as I can tell, there's nothing "easier" for men, except that less is expected of them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2003, 10:24</p><p>I often think that men can wear glasses so much better than women. By that I mean I think its much easier for them to look attractive. No doubt this will attract refuting comments so heres an example. Yesterday I changed my hairstyle, not dramatically but enough. I have blonde hair and a contemporary hairstyle that Ive had for coming up four years; I thought it was time for a change, so traded in my characteristic asymmetric style for something overall slightly shorter and (according to a similar style I saw in a magazine) a feminine and flattering style reminiscent of the 80s.  But what a difference it makes to a choice of specs.  With my old style I was thinking that my black matt metal rectangles looked better, now I find that the rimless that I thought made me look characterless so much better compliment this new style.  Now Im lucky that I have an alternative, because this could get expensive.  Anyone else have this experience?? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2003, 14:48</p><p>Jerry, What are Trivex lenses?  How do they compare to Varilux or are they a type of Varilux?  I am thinking of rimless but my new Rx is R -5.50 and  </p><p>L -6.50 and am concerned about thickness and my Rx is somewhat stronger than yours.  Am looking at a metric ruler, am I right that there are 10mm in 1 meter?  If so, my present lenses are about 5mm thick, each now  </p><p>-.25 less than the new Rx above but in large Polo plastic frames.  If rimless would want a much smaller "frame" but have to watch size since I have bifocal to consider (progressive).  Are yours bifocals?  Thanks, Tommy</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2003, 11:20</p><p>Joe, I read your post of Feb. 10 but have not seen any responses.  I too am considering rimless.  My Rx is a little less than yours, R -5.50 +2.75 bifocal, L -6.50 +2.75 bifocal.  Currently have rather large Polo tortise with varilux progressives, not too thick in those large frames.  Also have computer glasses, lesser Rx of course.  Do you have those?  I have not yet discussed with optician but last time I was there he had on rimless, not too thick and told me they were -6.25 and varilux progressives.  Do you have bifocals?  The optician's rimless somewhat small but he always says if bifocal then a larger size is better.  What was your progression to present Rx?  Have you pursued the rimless since your posting?  What are you wearing now?  I too am looking for advice from others. Tommy</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxine</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2003, 15:31</p><p>I am still looking for old style British N.H.S metal frames. I believe that they changed over the years, from being "Harry Potter" circular to being slightly more oval in shape, with the temple pieces hinged nearer the top of the frame rather than the middle. They were made in pink, blue or dark brown, (it may have been a dark tortoishell), and had springy wire earpieces.They were seemingly made in both adult and childrens sizes. I am now told that the brown tortoishell plastic frames, were also made with the springy earpieces in kids and adult sizes.With the amount of these glasses that were around in the early 1960s when I was at school, surely some have survived I would appreciate help in  locating these frames </p><p>     </p><p>       Maxine</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2003, 04:10</p><p>I had dinner with a married couple last night; the husband (black hair, black beard) was wearing rimless glasses with lowish minus lenses; and from the other side of the room I wondered once or twice whether he'd taken them off.

<p><b>Donna</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2003, 14:41</p><p>Joe </p><p>Go to a small independant optometrist if you want rimless glasses, that is what I did, and had no problems.The place I went to can make custom lenses  in any shape and size, and custom fit them to any bridge an temple combo. Their ad says- "If you can draw it, we can make it"I even asked for thicker lenses than neccessary for my RX to show off the polished edges (they are 6 mm thick at the edge) so you shouldn't have any problems. As your RX is much stronger than mine(I'm only -1.25)your lenses should look great, with all those power rings giving them a great sparkle </p><p>      Donna </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2003, 15:28</p><p>Joe -- I think rimless would work better than semi-rimless, as edge thickness starts to make the half-frame look sort of silly (but not terrible) at some point. </p><p> </p><p>What eyesize would you probably want in your glasses?  I mean, do you have a particularly large head?  If you can get lenses that aren't terribly large, I'd say your optician's attitude is ridiculous and you should go somewhere else.  How thick are your current glasses? </p><p> </p><p>I don't have rimless glasses this strong, though I sort of wish I did.  I won't bore the regulars with a diatribe I've given many times before, so I'll just say I think edge thickness is a real positive for rimless glasses (not a negative at all).  I think rimless glasses become a bold choice in the case of stronger prescriptions, but one that really works.  I don't really understand why someone would say that your glasses would be too thick in rimless, except because of "edge-a-phobia".   There's no hiding glasses at -7.5.   </p><p> </p><p>If you don't want people to know your glasses are strong, go with black plastic frames, perhaps clear plastic with a black coating (does an awesome job hiding any thickness or strength the lenses have).  The frames are bold and aren't overpowered by the lenses. </p><p> </p><p>But if you want rimless, then you're obviously not afraid of edge thickness in and of itself.  Rimless will look great (very sparkly) at your Rx...not thin, but great.</p><p></p><hr>

No noticeable distortions despite the wraparound lenses. I shopped around quite a bit but ultimately went with the Oakley lenses because most opticians wouldn't attempt the wraparound style.

The advantage of this route is that they will tint the lenses (if required) to their standards. In other words, the lenses would look the same as their plano sunglasses. It's a real advantage if you wanted their sunglasses but are visually challenged without correction. </p><p> </p><p>Yes they are expensive, both the frames and lenses. However, it's not the be all and end all. I have bought the Oakley Why 3 frames with the Lens 2 shape. I bought them from ebay and paid $147. A whole lot less than $300. It took me a while until I got what I wanted, but you know what they say about patience. </p><p> </p><p>I haven't had the Rx filled in. I'm saving up for the lenses. Any optical store (I asked) will fill in an Rx greater than that specified from oakley. It's only that Oakley cannot supply greater powers. </p><p> </p><p>Hope this info helps some of you.

I didn't know there was another type of rimless glasses, all the ones that I have seen, have had drilled lenses like my own. having a nylon line around the edge of the lenses would (for me anyway)spoil the "cut glass"look that drilled lenses have </p><p>           Donna</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;22 Jan 2003, 13:19</p><p>Sandy - that's interesting.  I just don't really like the way they look -- I think the line makes the lens-edges look less elegant.  But the nuisance of "regular maintenance" would kind of be a problem too.  (Mine are a year and a half old and, having been worn most days since I got them, are still in great condition.  Then again, I don't think I'll ever get over how much I paid for them.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sandy</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2003, 22:34</p><p>Alan, I have a rimless pair with the fishing line on the bottom holding the lens to the frame.  The only drawback on those are that I seem to have to go back to the eye doctor and have the line replaced every six months.  For some reason, the lens starts to get loose after that point.  Take care. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2003, 07:48</p><p>Bob - you're probably right; when I talk about rimless, I think of drill mounts.  But there are some other rimless styles...one where there's something like fishing line going around the edge of the lenses, holding them in.  I really am not a fan of this style.  And the one julian is talking about - I guess that's a drill mount too, but pretty different from the 'traditional' front-to-back drill mount.  Within these front-to-back drill mounts, there are some different techniques too -- mine are not screwed in, but rather sort of wedged between the outside of the lens and the drill hole - it seems to work really well (despite seeming as if it would be unstable).  Others are screwed in.  Maybe there are other strategies too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Leon</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2003, 23:27</p><p>Julian, you are probably referring to rimless Silhouette frames. They are titanium and very flexible.  </p><p>I think the official name of this line is Silhouette Titan Minimal Art.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2003, 22:38</p><p>There's another rimless style that I've seen in the last three years or so, rather than traditional drill mounts the temples and bridge are drilled into the edge of the lenses. I have a problem decribing them, but Daniel Vettori is wearing them in the link somebody posted the other day under 'Athletes'...they have a strong horizontal axis and would make a narrow face look broader. A friend of mine went into them not long ago. His are flexible titanium and his baby son is liable to grab them off his face and throw them about, and they seem to stand up to that OK - contrary to what you'd expect. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2003, 20:03</p><p>Donna, Alan, thanks for the feedback about rimless glasses. Maybe I should have said "drill mount" since I believe that's the more accurate term for what I'm considering, but it sounds like you were answering what I meant to ask.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2003, 19:14</p><p>Bob, </p><p> </p><p>I have had some rimless glasses for a little over a year.  They have polycarbonate lenses (which, depending on your prescription and other things, may not be the best material for you).  My glasses have antireflective coating.  From my experience, rimless glasses are no problem at all.  These glasses of mine have been a little bit of a pain to keep clean, but I think the issue is mostly because of the A/R coating -- it's a little tougher to clean.  But the glasses themselves have seemed very durable (polycarbonate is what they make bulletproof windows out of - so toughness is an advantage of the material, but it also has more distortion than other materials, so if your prescription is strong, it could be problematic).  Rimless glasses have a particular look...in a weak or even moderate prescription, they can be fairly difficult to see, so they tend to make less of a statement than other frame styles...yet they also look very elegant/fashionable/excellent to a person who is close enough to really see them.  I don't understand why you'd be steered away from them.  You need to know that they have the look you want, and you should definitely be resolved to take care of them (since there is no frame to protect them like some plastic frames would), but other than that, they aren't a problem.  They're great.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Donna</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2003, 16:56</p><p>Bob </p><p>I went for an eye test on Friday night, and spoke to my optometrist about rimless glasses,and he didn't seem to think there was any problem with them. Yes the lenses can break where the temples and bridge are attached to the lenses, but this is not a problem unique to rimless glasses, and shouldn't happen with normal care. I asked for thicker lenses than is neccessary for my rx, (i'm only -1.25 in both eyes) because I wanted the lenses to really show and sparkle, and he advised me to go for standard CR39 plastic, which has the added bonus of being tough and durable, and at 6mm thick in my case, unlikely to be fragile! I don't know what your rx is Bob, but you might want to discuss with your optometrist about making your glasses with thicker lenses to make them more robust  </p><p>               Donna </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bob</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2003, 15:55</p><p>I'm about to get a new pair of glasses and like the look of rimless. Every provider I've talked to has steered me away from rimless, saying that they require frequent adjustments, may chip or crack and have to be handled with extra care (on and off). People I know with rimless glasses (not all that many) do not report having extraordinary problems. Can any body help me with this? Are rimless glasses going to be a big problem?. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2003, 09:58</p><p>Donna - that's fantastic!  5-6 mm should look really good; that's substantial, but not overbearing.  I'm interested to hear how this turns out.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Donna</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2003, 09:42</p><p>Alan </p><p>I went to make an appointment for an eye test tonight, and spoke breiefly to my optometrist about thicker lenses in rimless frames, and I'm not the first person to ask about them either!,Although he didn't recommend going as thick as 8mm, he reckoned 5-6mm can be done no problem and can look good, especially an elongated octagonal shape (like an oblong with the corners knocked off!)which gives a "cut glass" look. I go on friday for my eye exam and I will let you know how I get on  </p><p>                                Donna</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Daffy</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2003, 20:25</p><p>It can be done though. I remember seeing a movie with Sandra bullock (Hope Floats) where her daughter (in character) was wearing plastic framed glasses and the lenses protruded at the back. They were rather thick lenses, but they were clearly plano. Maybe if you went to the optometrist and told them that you are playing a character in film or theater that needs thick glasses appearance. It might work!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2003, 19:56</p><p>Donna -- You're right about the curvature creating the refraction of a given prescription.  It's definitely possible to have thick lenses in a weak prescription, as far as the technical feasibility of it.  Take a thick lens blank and just don't grind much Rx into it ---&gt; you're done.  The two problems are (1) that lens thickness alone isn't the same as a strong lens that needs to be thick to do its job and (2) that it may be psychologically challenging to convince an optical to make a pair of -1.25 glasses with lenses 8mm thick.  They'll think you're insane...granted, you shouldn't care about that and neither should they; what you want is what they should give you.   </p><p> </p><p>  I'm not sure how to get the myodisc effect -- I don't think you could really get the effect without really disturbing the vision through the lens.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Donna</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2003, 16:03</p><p>Alan </p><p>I've lurked around E.S for some time now and what I've found out is amazing,and listening to others I thought that the strength of a lens was in the curvature of its surfaces rather than the thickness, It must surely be possible to make a lens around 8mm thick but having the same back an front curvature therefore having no optical power whatsoever, but still looking chunky. It should be possible to do this also with a plano lens even more easily and have a flat circular portion in the middle of the back creating a myodisc effect. perhaps some of the people like yourself and the OGL </p><p>can give me your opinions on this.By the way I do wear glasses, my RX is -1.25 in both eyes with 0.50 cyl in my right eye axis 175, Iwould like rimless glasses, but I would like them much chunkier than my present ones </p><p>                          Donna</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2003, 15:23</p><p>Donna -- I wouldn't expect it to be easy, or even possible to really make it work with a low Rx.  Part of the sparkle comes from the concentric rings, and they won't be as sparkly with just a thicker lens, I don't think.  (I could be wrong.)  We have discussed in the past on this bulletin board the possibility of thick lenses in low prescriptions.  Technically, it could be done, but opticians will tend to look at you funny (at best).  But I guess starting with CR39, asking for safety lenses, and perhaps just admitting the desire for a more substantial appearance might make it work. </p><p>   But I also think the cut-in effect of stronger lenses is part of what helps define the edge of rimless glasses, and you can't get that with weak lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Donna</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2003, 15:01</p><p>Alan </p><p>I agree with you, in that rimless glasses dont look good with thin lenses, can a relatively thick lens be made with a low RX to alleviate this problem? rimless glasses need thick polished edges to sparkle properly! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2003, 06:17</p><p>Portia: the B measurement is the distance from top to bottom of the lens at it's deepest point, the frames I mention are very shallow which doesn't leave much room for a reading seg. </p><p>The AO Compact is one of several lenses designed to fit a shallow frame, the seg can be as short as 14mm, but I personally prefer not less than 18mm in any lens design, my new ones are 20mm in the Image segment by Younger.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;05 Jan 2003, 22:29</p><p>Jerry, </p><p> </p><p>I'm with OGL on the drilled rimless -- it's a great look on a doctor.  And the prescription...rather than being too strong, it's just about strong enough.  Looking at a lot of pairs of rimless glasses, I've found that they don't look great in weak prescriptions, because they're SO nondescript.  A little edge thickness defines them better.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2003, 11:47</p><p>Eye Tri: nothing you can do about the yellowing process, and the only thing you can do to keep it from getting worse is keep the frames out of the sunlight. </p><p>Jerry: I would suggest a three piece drill mount (totally rimless) or a semi-rimless but keep them small.  My wife's scrip is basically the same as yours, and they look fine in high index plastic. The new kid on the block for lens materials is Trivex and it's great for thin and light.  My lab tells me that since it was introduced virtually all of their drill mounts are Trivex because it's also exceptionally strong. And for a change of pace, why not get a pair of small dark plastic rectangles? While they're fun, they somehow also project seriousness.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jerry</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2003, 11:22</p><p>Hi everyone, Happy New Year. </p><p>I'm having trouble deciding on new frames. I've been wearing CK titanium frames for about 4 or so years- I thought they were so small when I first got them, but now they look rather large compared to most styles these days. I like plastic frames, but they seem a bit too bold and too much of a statement, also a bit too much for the "younger crowd" (I'm going on 38 in a few months). Still like the metal frames too, though. </p><p> </p><p>What do you think would be a good frame style for this almost 38 year old guy? I'm a physician, so I don't want to be too outlandish and scare my patients! My Rx is -4.5 both eyes. Too thick for rimless? Stick with small metal frames?Plastic? Hmmm, so many choices. Just looking for opinions. Thanks!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eye Tri</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2003, 05:27</p><p>I have a frame question, so I hope this is an appropriate place to ask it.Recently I had current lenses put in a Fairfield frame that I bought in 1962. This beautiful frame is in great shape for it's age, but the clear plastic part has started to turn yellow. My question is whether there is any way to get rid of the yellow and/or stop it from getting worse?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2002, 10:45</p><p>After spending waaaaaay to many hours in waaaaaay to many airports over the last week, and of course keeping a watch out for GWG's, I can sum up the current frame trend with the line from the party scene in The Graduate, where Dustin Hoffman's character is told "one word - plastic".  Everyone, especially the younger set, is wearing plastic...and those who don't look terribly outmoded although the Air Titaniums are still nice.</p><p></p><hr>

We OO's should be impressed, while this fact would go right over the head of the average viewer!!!  :)  How's that for a glass-is-half-full perspective!?

Although not a movie there is a 'wonderful' scene in a Wonder Woman episode (Lynda Carter is my all time favourite GWG)where she gets into her car to drive off and slowly, in close up, puts on her own, about -4 specs. Fair enough you might think but then the baddies appear on the other side of the car park and she takes them off for a better look ! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2002, 19:46</p><p>Maverick and Peter -- though I share your wish to see models (for glasses and other things) wearing glasses with Rx lenses, I'm not sure I agree with you guys.  There's nothing about most male models that says "perfect vision" -- they aren't wearing glasses, but a lot of well-dressed men (maybe a majority) in their 20's and 30's in the US wear contacts, so this is an equally valid interpretation of the pictures. </p><p>   As to whether frames with no lenses is ridiculous, I don't think so.  I mean, a person with high-end lenses and a prescription under -3 --- which includes most people --- doesn't look much different than a person with planos or no lenses (particularly from the perspective of a non-OO).  And if you put -5 lenses in a pair, what is this saying to the person with -1 lenses and the person with +3 lenses?  I guess my point is that it's not so unrealistic, in my opinion, to have models wear planos.  (Not that I like it.) </p><p>   I think this is a different context than movies, where the actual Rx of lenses should (in my opinion) correspond to the visual problems of the wearer; someone with major vision problems shouldn't be wearing planos, someone needin glasses to read shouldn't be putting on strong-ish minus lenses (see The Medicine Man, I think), etc. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2002, 15:22</p><p>I cannot agree more, and have you noticed how all  (or almost all) male models in advertisements apprantly have perfect eyesight?.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2002, 11:24</p><p>On the subject of choosing frames am I the only one who gets really irritated that every advertising picture frame suppliers/opticians etc put out of models wearing their frames are either plano's or more usually have no lenses in them at all. </p><p>Ive always thought these pictures are pointless having not the slightest connection with the reality of what the frames would look like with lenses and are in a way patronising to us glasses wearers. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nancy</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2002, 08:30</p><p>Alan: </p><p>You're right, I can tell a big difference, but to most people it doesn't seem too different as I wear the +10 in RGP contacts and just have glasses with astigmatism correction and trifocals.  I do have glasses with the full correction but don't wear then ver often.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2002, 20:36</p><p>Alan: </p><p> </p><p>Yes, it is nearly impossible to project what the glasses would look like with the Rx lenses in them.  They really change the appearance.  I would imagine that Nancy can tell a big difference from her -20D lenses that she used to wear to her present +10D lenses (I think that is what it is or close to it).  High positive lenses have a very different appearance compared with high negative lenses, and especially compared to myodisc lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nancy</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2002, 06:24</p><p>Alan </p><p> </p><p>I don't really think my BF or Mom have ever had a real idea of what the finished product will look like.  My BF has a fairly strong script himself (-11) but he could not estimate what mine would look like. </p><p> </p><p>To answer your other question, with my new Rx, it is easier to choose frames as I don't have to consider whether the sides can close past the edge thickness or not.  This is helpful since there are so few nice frames that come with cable temples or can be retrofitted with cable temples.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2002, 21:58</p><p>AJ and Nancy -- I guess another thing that's tricky for people with strong prescriptions is that the frames themselves give a poor representation of what your finished glasses will look like, since the lenses themselves are so visible.  Would you say you (or your BF/sister/mom) have gotten a good feel over time for how the finished glasses will look with the frames being chosen? </p><p> </p><p>Nancy - you're wearing a really different Rx now than fairly recently, right?  Has this changed your frame selection much?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2002, 12:04</p><p>Alan: </p><p> </p><p>Choosing frames has always been a problem for me.  Like Nancy, my mother usually would pick them out, put them on me, and make the decision.  Her choices were pretty good.  Now, I have my sister come along and help pick out the frame.  The types of frames are somewhat limited with my high Rx, so I have had frames that were all pretty much the same, wire rims.  There is some possible variations in the shape of the lenses and in the color of the metal, gold, black, and silver.  Now, you can get metal frames in other colors too, red, blue, brown.</p><p></p><hr>

Also, I prefer cable temples and you can't get them with a lot of frames. </p><p> </p><p>I finding opticians, with my script I can't really use the chain places.

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2002, 04:44</p><p>Not "in" -- I think I'll mention slightly more about that baby shampoo thing-- You do want to close your eyes; I'm not sure how it would feel if you got a lot of it in your eyes. Wet your face a bit, close your eyes and dab a little on your eyelids, then rub your eyes in a circular motion (I think this uses your eyes' natural shape to push stuff out).  I think it helps to "look" (turn your eyes) upward while still keeping them closed, since part of the point is to expose just a bit of your eyelid to allow it to be scrubbed a little. After rubbing a bit, rince the baby shampoo off while doing the same thing.  You can actually do all this just with water or with a wet cloth, but I think the baby shampoo works better.  Oh yeah -- if you see an eye doctor (particularly an ophthalmologist), do mention feeling like your eyes are dry.  I've had mixed experiences with this - an optometrist I mentioned it to was completely unhelpful, but one guy was quite helpful. </p><p> </p><p>I feel like I should say something (to the general audience) about Choosing Frames.  OK, a question for everyone, especially those who have a relatively strong prescription and who don't generally wear contacts:  How do you choose frames, given that you can't see them without your glasses?  And do you think it's ironic that optical places don't usually even acknowledge this as an issue?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>not "in" with glasses</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2002, 21:49</p><p>alan - maybe i will try that baby shampoo thing, although the thought of putting shampoo in my eyes kinda freaks me out. i guess i don't mind wearing glasses, it's just weird wearing them when i see someone i know who's never seen me in them, you know? i think a lot of people have that problem too. </p><p> </p><p>oscar - yes, we have finals each semester. if we had the year long system that the UK has, i think all americans would get really lazy and procrastinate our studies until may. i think i would, unless i had a lot of tests and quizzes along the way to keep me on track.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2002, 16:48</p><p>Not 'in' -- </p><p> </p><p>A comment about the dryness you mentioned...I've had trouble with contacts over the past year or two, and the story might be relevant to you.  Basically, I felt like my eyes were dry all the time and it was getting tough to wear contacts.  I started reading about dry eye syndrome and eventually saw an ophthalmologist about it.  I read that dry eyes are really rare except in older people, and I was told that my eyes didn't have a moisture problem...but that they seemed to be irritated by something, probably an allergy I'd developed to something I used on my face or hair.  The doctor suggested that I try not using anything other than cleanser on my face and hair for a while, and 'scrub' my eyes using baby shampoo (b/c it's non-irritating).  I also read that eyes are often dry simply because a person doesn't blink enough...and I figured out that my eyes were dry because they were irritated, which made blinking kind of painful, so I didn't blink enough.  I've sort of developed a habit of forcing myself to blink more if my eyes feel irritated/dry, so they will have more tears and clean out better.  The baby shampoo (while weird) really helped a lot.  Getting enough sleep helps me a lot, too, though it's not often possible.  Anyway, this might not be the same situation as you have at all, but it's a possibility. </p><p> </p><p>You said you have worn your glasses frequently, as you've been in your dorm room a lot.  Do you feel like your main motivation to wear contacts is for appearance sake, or something else?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2002, 18:43</p><p>There's no accounting for taste, of course, but I find it hard to believe that a collection that includes Giorgio Armani, Emporio Armani, Modo, A/P Lab, Brooks Brothers and many others (as LC has)wouldn't have something wearable outside the front door. </p><p>Anyway, this will be a long one, relating to the chain optical business. But to give it an upfront summary, headnoting as we call it in the law business, it boils down to (a) people and (b) the market. </p><p>Fortunately, the manager Portia finally met was ABO - American Board Of Opticianry Certified (as am I), ABO's are rare in the chains although LC does have more of them than the others. Trying to hire, and then retain, good people in the optical business is nearly impossible, the average shelf life in any given chain store of any person is about 1 1/2 years. Most of the young folks sought the position at the same time they sought other retail positions, and a lot of them just moved over from a shoe store, clothing store, music store or other retail shop. You couldn't give me a manager's position because with the amount of time you spend solving personnel problems, catering to higher management demands, and otherwise putting out fires means you rarely get to do what opticians want to do....serve the customer/patient. </p><p>The same holds true back in the lab, these kids are hired off the street and like the retail kids, no one plans to stay for a career.  Why? Money.  You would be aghast at how little these folks are paid.....and even the managers.   </p><p>LC probably created the monster, the superoptical (read: one hour) concept and I call it a monster because now the vast majority of the public demands it. Like Portia said, American fast foods, fast cars, etc. are the thing.  This big snowball is rolling down the mountain totally out of control and devouring everything in sight.  Why?  Because the the people DEMAND it.  And all of the chains have been forced to provide it, or perish.  In Madison, Sterling had two stores, one closed totally while the other closed for reorganization and reopened on a very shaky basis while the giant, Pearle, pulled out of a market of over a quarter million people entirely.   </p><p>Every chain store has it's niche, and besides the aforementioned the bottom feeders with their price advertising and low quality merchandise survive by basically being the managed care providers. </p><p>As an aside, the speakerphone thing doesn't make sense.  Placing orders? In every shop I've ever worked at and/or done corporate espionage in that's all done by computer.....there was only one speakerphone in the store and that was back in the manager's office for corporate communications. </p><p>At any chain, quality control varies because of people.  I had excellent service and quality at one of the chains, 4 different of their stores in Wisconsin, and recommended that chain to my daughters.  They went to one in Salt Lake City and one in Myrtle Beach and won't go back, because the people that attempted to serve them were incompetent. </p><p>So, if your expectations are to be treated like a long time customer at Tiffany's, then shop at Tiffany's. The superoptical chains meet and usually exceed the expectations of the customers that created the demand in the first place.  And always remember, it's a people business and if the store can't get the people they won't be able to provide the service.  And until the price of l hour glasses goes way up, there won't be good enough wages and bennies to attract and keep the good people.</p><p></p><hr>

If one must try out a prescription, this is the place, but I can imagine they could produce anything I could wear outside my front door.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2002, 11:00</p><p>At the invitation of Alan, I will post an explanation of how and why the chains are the way they are.....later.  First, I have to flame on my friends and fellow posters who have wrongfully twisted the name of an extremely respected optical organization, Lenscrafters. </p><p>It is number one in the superoptical (by definition, one hour service) business in the world, over 850 locations in 3 countries, with sales that top the next leading chain in spite of the fact they have more locations.  It was the first of the superopticals and uses only top quality name brand materials, but does more than just pocket it's profits. </p><p>On at least an annual, and on the average more often than that basis, not only completely funds but provides from within it's workforce volunteers to go the poorest of countries on our planet </p><p>and give free examinations and eyewear to those who need it most.  There is a waiting list of employees to go on these missions to poverty stricken and often dangerous areas, I've personally seen videos (TWGO has been on four of them) and it is heart wrenching to see the conditions for both the citizens and the volunteers.  100% of the costs are paid by LC using the eyeglasses donated through the Lion's Clubs. </p><p>And speaking of the Lions, when they (and other community social organizations) prequalify needy individuals within this country and defray a very small part of the costs, LC gives both the exam and the eyewear to people who are treated with the same dignity and respect as paying customers, right in the local LC stores. </p><p>LC personnel also volunteer their own time to neutralize and rehabilitate the donated glasses, and there are donor boxes in every LC store. </p><p>Every store, once a year, has a "hometown day" event in which they close the store to the public, and spend the entire day giving free exams and free eyewear to individuals selected by the Lions and other community organizations, again, completely funded by LC at no cost to the organizations or individuals. </p><p>LC provides the Vision Van, a large motorhome with two exam lanes, a dispensary, and a complete lab that goes to the scene of every major U.S. disaster whether it be flood, fire, tornado, or 9/11.  It is funded by LC and staffed by LC volunteers, giving free eyecare and eyewear to those who need it immediately so they can get on with their lives.  When the country is between disasters, the Vision Van visits low income neighborhoods doing the same. </p><p>Collectively, these charitable efforts are known as the Gift Of Sight program and the entire optical industry honored LC in 2001 with an award recognizing them as the humanitarian organization that they are. </p><p>Corporately, LC publishes a list of Core Values, two of which are "to constantly and measurably improve" and "to act with uncompromising integrity".  Not surprisingly, the company is voted in the Forbes magazine top 100 employers in the country year in and year out, BY IT'S OWN EMPLOYEES! </p><p>So, if you want to post a bad experience, or criticize the frame and/or lens selection, please be my guest.  But an organization of this caliber does not deserve to have its name twisted by adding the derogatory name "crappers" as a suffix.   </p><p></p><hr>

Maybe OGL can chime in with a more well rounded viewpoint. </p><p> </p><p>The 2nd and 4th pairs of glasses I bought were from Lenscrappers.  My experience was a lot like yours - unprofessional service, mediocre quality.  I ultimately haven't been impressed with their frames, either -- large selection, but few that I really liked.  My 3rd pair of glasses I got when I was in a small college town and wanted to get some new glasses.  I was walking past a cute little optical shop and I decided to stop in.  The selection was small, but the frames were nice and the staff had a good sense of what would fit my face.  They tried a lot of different things and I ended up with a much nicer pair of glasses than I'd had before.  The actually gave me high index lenses with polished edges because they thought they would look better with the very light frames (they didn't make me pay for them).  My 4th pair of glasses I decided to really shop around.  I actually went to 4 different places - 2 were small 'boutique' type shops, very fashionable.  They were expensive, but the frames were very nice and the staff was very helpful.  I also went to my optometrist's office (which has a small optical), but the selection was small and the guy helping me didn't seem to have much sense of style.  And I went to more of a chain-type optical, a step up from Lenscrappers but not as high-end as the first two places.  I ended up deciding between pairs at the two boutique type places.  They cost a fortune, but they're really great glasses. </p><p> </p><p>More recently, I bought a pair from www.39dollarglasses.com. They aren't made quite as well as they could be, but the optics are great and they are really cool frames.  And the price was sure right (about $45 with shipping). </p><p> </p><p>I think it pays to be picky about selecting frames.  And I think there are places that will do glasses much cheaper than Lenscrappers (Wal Mart, Costco, 4-eyes) and will probably stand behind their glasses pretty well.  I don't have much experience with being demanding about lenses, though -- I've always been happy with what I've gotten as far as the optics go.  Fit and fashion have always been what was lacking for me. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2002, 22:18</p><p>I bought a couple pairs of glasses at Lenscrafters (last time about 4 years ago).  Since I never found a particularly great frame there, since they're not very cheap, and since their work is mediocre, I don't think I'll ever go back.  The 30-day guarantee is nice, but I think the odds of getting a satisfying final result are probably actually better at a more professional place.  Or I could order a pair online for under $50, and if I didn't like them, I could just order once or twice more and still come out ahead!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2002, 21:18</p><p>I went for an eye exam today at my favorite university eye clinic. Amongst other things, I realized that my record ther probably predated the birth year of the fourth year optometry resident who examined me. This is unimportant, as they should all be as good as the woman who examined me today. </p><p> </p><p>She listened to my concerns, did an incredibly thorough exam that was reviewed by her professor, and both sat down to discuss the results with me. </p><p> </p><p>Has anyone else noticed that the optometry profession is increasingly femal and Asian, not necessarily in that order? </p><p> </p><p>The small print has been getting smaller and all of the usual thorough test aside, we needed to do something about that.  </p><p> </p><p>Same old distance Rx, new add of +3.00, increased from +2.50. </p><p> </p><p>Off to lenscrappers for the first test drive of any new Rx, as they will change it at no charge for 30 days, and I have been known to want changes.  </p><p> </p><p>I have learned to get the reading Rx filled first. (I like separate reading glasses even though I think progressives are right up there with sliced bread.)If the reading glasses in a new Rx (cheap single vision numbers) don't work, having the same Rx made up in progressives is realling sending $$ down the drain. </p><p> </p><p>Lenscrappers, even in a nice part of Manhattan, is a terrible, annoying place, with telephones ringing constantly and staff acting as though you are in their way. Their habit of putting the telephone on speakerphone mode that can be heard throughout the store, to input their orders (do I really want to hear all of their stupid ordering voice prompts?) is beyond dreadful.  </p><p> </p><p>Luck had it that I was finally waited on by the manager--ABO, said his name tag, if this means anything, as the rest of them would not have lasted long at Mc Donald's. </p><p> </p><p>I think I was fortunate to have him and it only happened because one of his useless employees was out at Starbucks. He did his job efficiently and said that they would be ready in an hour. I explained very carefully that he was to extract the reading portion of the Rx from the one I had been given, and that I wanted to retain the original written Rx. </p><p> </p><p>I allowed well over an hour by the time I returned (is it an American-- fast cars, fast food, fast glasses-- thing that we have going on here?  </p><p> </p><p>Because these never leave the house, appearance is less important, and it took me less than an hour to choose the frames. When I received them, the workmanship looked amateurish, or at least as though it had been produced under the gun. Why is it that semi-rimless have a groove all around the edges, as though they were meant to be fit into a different frame?  </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, the newest, hippest glasses I have (and I did try the darker plastics, but they all screamed !!GLASSES!! to me) are the new reading glasses from Lenscrappers. Hope the husband likes them at least as well as he liked me coming home after a long weekend.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2002, 18:11</p><p>Just read the fine print, yes, they will use CR-39 as their material in a price advertised pair and then will try to "sell you up" to whatever.  But most chains are constantly running sales, and as I said, use coupons.  Either off the net, or in the case of Lenscrafters, today's Sunday paper advertising supplements had a bunch of $50 &amp; $75 off coupons.  One thing you can't do is bargain them off their price, but there is always a sale and/or a coupon available.  Just don't pay full price!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gary</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2002, 14:46</p><p>Yep, OGL, Lenscrafters and Pearle have quite a few stores up here: some not more than a few blocks away from each other surprisingly! </p><p> </p><p>There are also many other little outlets which might not have the largest selection, but are not bad at all on the prices. </p><p> </p><p>BTW, when places have a pre-determined price for a "complete pair of glasses," do they by default use CR-39?

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2002, 10:06</p><p>Gary: that's up to you, the time issue I mean.  One thing I always quizzed the customer on was whether or not the current scrip was working.  Also, I wouldn't do a progressive.  Depending on where you are in Canada, Lenscrafters is international and I think they have some stores up there and aren't particularly pricey although they are on the top end for chains.  Go to their website, you can usually print out some money savings coupons as well as find their locations.

I can't speak for elsewhere, but most of us will neutralize, or "read" the rx when requested although would much rather work off a prescription.

All the links you guys posted here were very helpful. Thanks a lot. I'm thinkin about getting some metal frames. I have the plastic, brown nerdy style ones right now, but I think I look to serious in them, like a schoolteacher or something.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Henry</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2002, 16:00</p><p>Just to let you know that the Henry that posted here recently is not me. </p><p> </p><p>Regards, Henry</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2002, 12:06</p><p>Henry: yes, it can be done, what they would have to do is equalize the base curve with the back curve to achieve a plano center.  Your poly would probably have been a 1.54 or 1.56 index, if you go to a higher index such as 1.60 or even higher that would further minimize the difference.   But bear in mind that no matter what you do, the concentric rings of the -3 won't be present in the plano lens nor will be the minimization.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Henry</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2002, 11:11</p><p>I have followed the discussion on how to minimize the difference between lenses with great interest. For a very good reason I might add. I have L: plano, R: -3. Polycarbonate worked fairly well on my latest pair (rimless). The lenses are fairly small which might explain that.  </p><p> </p><p>One thing I have thought about but never tried is asking the shop to increase the center line thickness of the plano lens and let that even out the thickness. Not sure what to ask either. </p><p> </p><p>OGL, could you please tell me if this is feasible and how would I go about it. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks Henry    </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2002, 09:29</p><p>Bobby: you're quite right in who would notice the difference, but you left out the most important one who notices: the wearer! Every time this situation has arisen it's the customer themselves that tell me "I have to look at myself in the mirror and I don't want one eye to look different from the other".</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>not "in" with glasses</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2002, 17:57</p><p>Thank you everyone for your advice. I'll tell you guys about any updates when I go get my eyes checked tomorrow.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2002, 14:59</p><p>Hi "not in" </p><p>All the advice, that has been posted are very good. I just want to add, that you do not need to worry, the difference is quite small, and only professional opticians and freaks like us, Eyesceners could tell the difference. Best regards</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Vikki</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2002, 14:09</p><p>Hi not "in" </p><p>I found anti reflective coating on the lenses also helped "hide" the lenses, when I first started wearing glasses full time I just wanted to hide or disguise them but now I use them as a fashion statement and wear bold shapes and colours, good luck.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2002, 10:56</p><p>Not 'in' -- I think the difference between the lenses would only be noticable with regular plastic lenses, and almost all eyeglass suppliers these days will try to convince you to get higher index lenses - either polycarbonate or high index plastic. </p><p> </p><p>Eyeglasses.com has a lot of frames.  But if you're at the 'looking' stage (not 'buying'), go to some glasses shops and try on some frames.  People there are usually very happy to help you pick out pairs and sometimes they can give really good advice. </p><p> </p><p>39dollarglasses.com has a smaller selection but offers good glasses at a very low price.  But if you're not excited about wearing glasses, the best advice is to look around for a long time for just the right pair...and if I were you, I'd steer clear of wire or metal frame glasses; your comment about the difference between the lenses makes me think that you're sensitive to how thick your lenses look.  This is much less of an issue with plastic frames and rimless glasses than with wire/metal frames.  You could get away with metal frames if you went with a small frame, very high index lenses, and bought them at a really high-quality establishment (usually a small shop, not an optical chain; I'm not so sure about online, but the quality I've seen online is only oK).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2002, 08:11</p><p>not "in": how about if we change your moniker to not "in" but "should be" 8&lt;) </p><p>If you want to diminish the effect of one lens being stronger than the other get the highest index material possible, as it will appreciably thin the stronger of the two while not having as much an effect on the weaker. </p><p>Your CL scrip, in all probability, is not the same as your spex rx because if you have a small amount of cyl (as most of us do) they won't try to correct that with CL's.  Your sphere (nearsighted) part will probably be the same as that scrip is low enough so as to not be affected by vertex, but if you are going to get a spectacle correction get the best possible and have the astigmatism corrected if indeed you do have it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pete</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2002, 04:29</p><p>try Eyeglasses.com it has hundreds of frames and you can scan your photo in and try the frames on, Vikki my wife uses it to help select frame shapes and styles and finds it great.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>not "in" with glasses</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2002, 20:25</p><p>I was wondering if anyone here knows good places to browse for glasses online. I usually wear contacts, so I don't know what all my options are. I'm 19, female, and my prescription is L:-5.5 and R:-4.0. Well, that's for contacts. If anyone knows how to convert that to a glasses prescription, that would help. Thanks. Also, any suggestion for lenses? I don't want it apparent that one eye needs a stronger lense than the other.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>claudia</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2002, 04:56</p><p>@Alan: </p><p>The prosthesis is fixed with three titanium screws. No change to attach the glasses here. </p><p>The danger of being hurt by the piercing is a point, but I can imagine no situation where this could happen. </p><p>I've also already talked with the prosthesist, he simply suggested to wear the prosthesis full time, but I only want to wear it for cosmetic reasons in public because of the itching and sweating. </p><p> </p><p>@Julian: </p><p>This was exactly what I meant. </p><p> </p><p>@Portia: </p><p>It's a simple crash helmet (don't know whether there's a special term for it - I'm not a native speaker) for riding motocycles etc.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Apr 2002, 22:50</p><p>Alan, I understood Claudia to be talking about having a piercing and putting in a ring that the temple could hook through. If that isn't what you meant, Claudia, it might be another possibility. Maybe? Or not? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;29 Apr 2002, 20:48</p><p>Claudia, What is the purpose of the helmet to which you refer?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;29 Apr 2002, 19:45</p><p>Claudia, </p><p>  How does your prosthesis attach? </p><p>  Your friends' suggestions sound interesting. Some sort of piercing might work, though I think you'd definitely want someone who knew what they were doing to design the strategy. You don't want to firmly attach the glasses to a piercing, because then if the glasses get jerked somehow, it could tear your skin.  So who would be the right person to do this?  I'm really not sure, but I would have guessed a medical person who does a variety of prosthetic work would be your best bet -- has this ever come up with whoever supplied your prosthetic? </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>claudia</b>&nbsp;29 Apr 2002, 07:54</p><p>My rx is -0,75 diptrines in both eyes. I know that wearing glasses full time is not really necessary with such a low prescription, but there are some moments where I need to wear glasses, but don't like to use my prosthesis (because it itches and the skin sweats under it), e.g. in class (everybody knows it, so there's no need to wear the prosthesis), at home watching TV or under a helmet. A plastic surgey is not possible and I also don't like contact lenses (too expensive, nasty feeling). </p><p>I've already got some hints from friends which sound maybe a bit weird, but could work. Hint one was to get a sort of earring-piercing behind the ear where I could hook the temple. The second hint was to use sports glasses combined with an elastic string. But I haven't seen good-looking sports glasses yet.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2002, 22:05</p><p>Claudia, you will have to tell us your glasses Rx and then we can help you with various wearing solutions. If you are moderately myopic with no astigmatism correction, than there is no need to wear your glasses to study or get around your apartment.  </p><p> </p><p>Contact lenses could be another solution. </p><p> </p><p>Plastic surgery might be a possibility. </p><p> </p><p>Crazy glue could be a short-term expedient.  </p><p> </p><p>Someone else at some time has faced your situation.

<p><b>claudia</b>&nbsp;26 Apr 2002, 06:47</p><p>I (17) will get glasses soon. But I'm missing a auricle. I wear a removable silicon prosthesis, but sometimes I don't want to wear the prosthesis (e.g. while reading in bed, wearing a helmet, being at home), but wear my glasses. Is there any way to fix the glasses with only one ear? My optometrist suggested to fix the temple with plaster, but this doesn't seem to be so convenient. Any suggestions? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PS: sorry for my bad english, I'm not a native speaker</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2002, 08:14</p><p>The piece you have to pull out - the bit with the hole in it - always retracts when it's unscrewed. You have to pull it out against the force of the spring - and somehow screw that tiny screw through the hole. Ideally needs three hands. I've done if myself on my previous pair of specs.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lazysiow</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2002, 07:49</p><p>There isn't a spring loaded part, all I have is a screw ,the frames and the arms. It might have popped out when the screw did. It's just the arm doesn't seem to be able to go all the way in so I can never get a full hole to put the screw in (if that makes any sense)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2002, 01:01</p><p>Lazysiow - you gotta pull the spring-loaded part out - which is a really fiddly exercise. Try using needle-nosed pliers to the a grip on the thing and pull it out as far as it will go - then you should have a bit of leeway to be able to fit the screw in properly. When your patience runs dry - try counting to ten!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lazysiow</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2002, 23:05</p><p>damn this should go into a thread called Glasses Repair but it doesn't exist 8) *pokes Wurm* </p><p> </p><p>does anyone know how to screw in spring hinge arms? I have an older frame I'm trying to fix atm, both are spring hinged and they both have the same problem where the screw hole of the arm doesn't quite slide in all the way into the frame, it gets about half way. I know its doable since I had an optician do my regular pair today (thats another story in itself) but I wanted to learn how to do one myself</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2002, 16:17</p><p>lover: </p><p>I would just agree to her choice of #11, and tell her she looks stunning, which will be no more than the truth. You might then maximise your chances of keeping her away from the contact lenses, which is your duty to all your OO friends. Go for it!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lover</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2002, 04:05</p><p>Hands off! She's mine! :-) </p><p>No, this should be a thread where we discuss which frame fits best to a certain face as we did in the Sightings thread.</p><p></p><hr>
