<p><b>Sparky</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2018, 03:48</p><p>Hi .Can anyone explain how to use the gov table.thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Enter</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2018, 11:48</p><p>I would like to meet someone using GOC in Istanbul or Paris in August. I do the same with strong prescription for changing experiences. Is anyone out there and ready to meet? Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soyuz</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2018, 03:55</p><p>I have almost forgot: as I removed the glasses and took out the contacts after 4-5 hours GOC, I needed at least 5-10 minutes to accomodate again to the normal condition. Seeing near was almost immediately ok but seeing far was complicated and needed time. </p><p>As I had to remove my glasses after 3-4 hours at the optometrist she took them with her to her work-desk and I had to walk there without them, I was dizzy, felt lost and uncomfortable. Enjoyed a lot, I hope u too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soyuz</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2018, 03:32</p><p>I have always read nice stories about experiences of Eyescene community here, got a lot of help how to choose the right glasses prescription for GOC glasses. I thoght now its time to write a short story. </p><p>Had a great experience today with GOC. From morning till noon I enjoyed my -18 glasses with +15 contacts. First I had some little trouble with steps and stairs, than half and hour later all accomodated and went smooth. I even had cut my hair at salon. Started leting wash my hair, had to take off glasses, again on and explained her how difficult for me to see without it. Again take off for cutting, had an incoming call but I couldnt read who called, she helped me and had a little conversation about vision and glasses. I told how lucky she is not needing glasses to see. She asked my prescription I told its quite strong and if she doesnt know much numbers wont tell much. I explaint my prescription (-18), her answer was OMG, this is a lot and we talked what a little I can see without is. She asked a few times during the haircut wheather it is the right lenght, but I disappointed her I cannot see I trust her. It will be a surprise at the end what she created. Had a smile and later left the place. </p><p>The glasses slpped down always thats why I went to an optometrist shop. I asked to fix both sides and she did it pleased but told the problem is the strong prestription and the heavy lenses they slip down on the nose. I said I cannot do much because my eyes are very shortsighted. She said sorry and told I can come back anytime to fix it. </p><p>All this enlighted my day and decided to do more often if its possible to get the blast. I hoped you enjoyed it!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>notcooljames</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2018, 02:49</p><p>Glasses now are much more "refined" than 10 years ago, meaning thinner glasses even in much higher dioptrics although still there is some space for improvement. </p><p> </p><p>I have -14 meaning I am blind and dangerous :D So I switch between Proclear contacts https://www.lentiamo.co.uk/biofinity-xr-3.html and prescription glasses. The optical field you get to have with contacts, especially in higher power, cannot be compared to contacts IMO!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 May 2018, 18:33</p><p>Well I was waiting for that same crap to start. Maybe you should grow up and stop acting a fool. You're nothing but a piece of shit that loves accusing everyone of being a fake or using multiple names I been in here for over ten years and have only every used only my name as it is. Go back fro yourself and you see how long I have been around. What about you? How long have you been an asshole? Others may stop coming in here because of assholes like you but you're wasting your time if you think i'm going anywhere. I were to leave then that would mean that you won. Guess what!

<p><b>María</b>&nbsp;30 May 2018, 03:59</p><p>Oh, come on! That María on 29 May 2018, 21:51 isn't me. English isn't my birth language, but at least I know its "astigmatism" and not "astigmatisms". This kind of shit is why I held off posting for so much time, even if I have kept reading. Between racists, homophobics, trolls and impersonators, this forum is going to shit. </p><p> </p><p>My prescription went up a little, 0,25 on each eye. I believe I posted about it a while ago. I don't have any astigmatism, so stop inventing stuff. I liked GOC but I'll have to try it a bit more. For now I still prefer wearing glasses that my eyes can adapt to. I'll soon buy a pack of +6 contacts to use with a pair of -9 glasses I bought. </p><p> </p><p>I have had a few interesting experiences using the glasses I bought, and I have some very interesting pairs in my collection I'd love to post about, but the unbearable toxicity in here demotivates me. Sorry Soundmanpt and other that could show real interest, maybe I'll feel like sharing some experiences in a few days, but now I grew tired of these little shits again. We'll see.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>María</b>&nbsp;29 May 2018, 21:51</p><p>Soundmanpt Yes, I do now have a stronger prescription. I also am supposed to have some correction for astigmatisms in each eye, but decided to hold off on getting it because I do not want to become dependent on glasses. </p><p>I also think that having astigmatisms corrected for, could hinder me in doing further GOC. </p><p>Yes, I do want to try some strong minus glasses for GOC.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 May 2018, 07:57</p><p>Maria </p><p>It has been a while since you commented in here. Sorry for all the typos in my comment to you. I was in hurry and didn't check what I had typed. Nice to hear that you're still buying used glasses. Are you still going to another town where you can wear some of them all day long? You had started wearing some of your glasses around you own town to places like the post office and the store. Have you stopped doing that? Personally I enjoyed hearing about your adventures wearing glasses often times much stronger than your own actual glasses are. Over th e off season from landscaping did you have any interesting adventures wearing glasses from your collection?  </p><p>After doing GOC, which do you prefer doing? GOC or simply wearing strong glasses and allowing you eyes to adjust to them? You need to see if you can find plus contacts so you can wear minus glasses next time. Since your eyes seem to tolerate quite strong glasses already youdon't have to be too exact with the combination to be able to see pretty good once your eyes adjust.  </p><p>Did you get a small increase in your actual prescription? I thought your glasses were -.50 / -.75? I just remember that you barely even needed glasses except for driving.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>María</b>&nbsp;27 May 2018, 23:19</p><p>Soundmanpt, yes I am. The collection has grown, the bravery not as much haha.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 May 2018, 18:10</p><p>Maria  </p><p>Are you the same Maria that was buying glasses form people in all sorts of prescriptions and wearing them in other city and towns so as not to recognized? You lowly had gotten more brave and was wearing them around your own town.I believe you were in the landscaping business.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>María</b>&nbsp;27 May 2018, 14:30</p><p>Anon, if you are talking about me, sorry but I don't have any problem in answering. I bought two boxes of daily contacts in a second-hand market app, from a person that had surgery and doesn't need them anymore. </p><p> </p><p>https://i.imgur.com/fk4uIZD.jpg </p><p>https://i.imgur.com/WzCbp8J.jpg </p><p> </p><p>So, not a fake. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Trent</b>&nbsp;27 May 2018, 14:07</p><p>Contacts express does ask for a Prescription so I gave them one. There is no way they check every Rx, probably just for their records.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;27 May 2018, 10:57</p><p>All these people who are claiming to do GOC, yet when the question has been repeatedly asked where are you buying your contact lenses without a prescription these days, there is no answer.  It's sad but I think we are seeing a shit ton of fakes in this thread.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>María</b>&nbsp;27 May 2018, 07:38</p><p>Hi! Long time no see! </p><p> </p><p>I did GOC for the first time today! I was scared, but it was a very thrilling experience. </p><p> </p><p>I wore -6.50 contacts and an awesome pair of +5.50 +5.25 aviators. With my -0.75 -1 prescription I just did the rough calculus to try. I loved it! Used the combo, taking the glasses on and off several times, and it was hugely exciting. I'm not a fan of contacts, but they were much more comfortable than I thought. I'll repeat in the future, that's for sure!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Greg</b>&nbsp;25 May 2018, 23:22</p><p>Dix I loved your GOC experiences. Any more stories to share?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dix</b>&nbsp;22 May 2018, 21:49</p><p>Hi yesterday I wore my GOC pair (-12 CR39) in public for the first time. I was worried there were any know person. But didn't have any problem. </p><p>First I went to the service station to pump air to my car Tyres. I went out from the car show myself with glasses. There was a helper to bump air. I saw he was looking at my glasses few times. I saw myself from the car window reflection I was like a real high myopic person. I'm so happy to see myself like a high myopic person. </p><p>Then I went to another service station to wash my car. When I went there I was few people there in the waiting area. I was bit scared whether there was any know person. But I was lucky. When I got down from the car my glasses fogged out and I couldn't able to see anything. It was a nice experience. When I remove my glasses to wipe them out I realized how blind I was without them. When I wore them back and look at the customer lobby I was some ladies were looking that incident. I was thrilled. Then I went inside the lobby sat on a seat where I can see them. </p><p>I started to play with my glasses </p><p>First I tried to clean them by holing them up and looking at the light. Then I tried to relax my eyes by removing them. Finally I started to read a news paper. I could see them properly with my GOC but I hold the paper very close to my eyes to show I'm struggling to read with them. I was those ladies were talking about my vision and my coke bottle glass. Long story short I could able to talk with them. They asked how I became so blind to wear such a thick glasses. I said I born with poor eye site. I knew they felt very sorry about my vision. </p><p> </p><p>Then I went to the pharmacy to get some medicine to my uncle. There was a young girl who was interested about my glasses. I was she looked at my glasses several times. :)  </p><p> </p><p>After have my lunch I had a nap in the car without glasses. I had a good sleep and suddenly the car window knocked. I worked up and I was unable to anything. I was scared and totally helpless. I could remember where I kept my glasses. I struggled to find them but couldn't. I manged to put the car window down and asked that person whether he can see my glasses. He handed them to me from the car dash. I thanked him and wore them. He was a parking ticket guy. I realized how helpless those real high myopic people when they lost their glasses.  </p><p>I had a good time with my GOC. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;22 May 2018, 19:31</p><p> </p><p>north44, </p><p>I don't have any experience suggesting GOC Toric Contact lenses to make pre-existing glasses, with cylinder, work with another persons actual prescription.  In fact, I strongly suggest that you don't try it, unless you have plenty of money to waste.  When advising people wanting to do GOC we strongly suggest that you NEVER buy pre-existing glasses, hoping to find some combination that will work.  Success would fall in the miracle category. </p><p>Toric lenses have a reputation of sometimes being tricky to fit, for even an experienced ECP. The problem is that all contact lenses are designed to float on a tear film and move around some as you blink, to help circulate Oxygen, nutrients, and moisture to the Cornea.  The problem with Toric Contacts is that IF they rotate away from the exact axis when you blink, you will experience very significant blurring, particularly in this instance where you are trying to match up the axis of two different lenses with a significant Cylinder component so they cancel each other.  The Toric Contact is unstable, by its very nature. </p><p>Here are the calculations.  I make no guarantees that the Combo will work or be wearable. </p><p>Your prescription: </p><p>R +0.75 </p><p>L +0.50 </p><p>GOC glasses prescription: </p><p>R +7.00, -2.50 x 10 </p><p>L +6.25, -2.50 x 155 </p><p>Effective power at the Cornea assuming 12 mm Vertex Distance (VD) nearest increment. </p><p>R +7.50, -2.50 x 10 </p><p>L +6.75, -2.50 x 155 </p><p>Inverse Toric Prescription to neutralize the glasses </p><p>R -7.50, +2.50 x 10 </p><p>L -6.75, +2.50 x 155 </p><p>Adjustment for north44s prescription </p><p>R -6.75, +2.50 x 10 </p><p>L -6.25, +2.50 x 155 </p><p>Conversion to -cylinder for Toric Contacts. </p><p>R -4.25, -2.50 x 100 </p><p>L -3.75, -2.50 x 65 </p><p>I would invite any members familiar with GOC calculations to critique the above. </p><p>It is highly unlikely that any self fitted GOC combo will be wearable.  Have you ever worn contact lenses where you know your BC and Diameter? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>north44</b>&nbsp;22 May 2018, 11:14</p><p>hi </p><p> </p><p>my prescription is </p><p> </p><p>R: + 0.75  </p><p>l: + 0.5 </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;08 May 2018, 05:18</p><p>Sparky, </p><p>Yes, you will still need an Add in your GOC glasses.  Here is my suggestion, Right eye first. </p><p>OD (R) Sphere -4.75, Cylinder -0.25, Axis 5, Add +1.50 </p><p>OS (L) Sphere -4.75, Cylinder -0.25, Axis 15, Add +1.50 </p><p>I also suggest ordering a trial pair of very inexpensive single vision glasses from an online retailer such as Zenni.  IF your distance vision is good the the GOC combo, try a pair of +1.50 OTC readers over them to make sure you also like the combo for close work.  If you like what you see, then order the glasses you really want to wear with the CLs. </p><p>Please remember that GOC is not an exact science so there are no guarantees.  Also, if you do not already wear CLs, you need an exam to get the Base Curve, Diameter, and Brand of Contacts.  You need for the CLs to have good Oxygen permeability and Moisture characteristics.  If you don't, you probably will not be able to wear them very long, with comfort. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sparky</b>&nbsp;07 May 2018, 23:06</p><p>Hi .also I cannot read at all without my glasses.will I be able to read with the minus glasses combo.please could you provide the full prescription for my glasses.if I will need the add.i currently wear multifocals.thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sparky</b>&nbsp;07 May 2018, 21:07</p><p>Sorry about the limited info.my full prescription is L +4 -0.25×15 .R +4 -0.25×5 .Add 1.50.will I still need the add in the minus glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 May 2018, 10:09</p><p>Sparky, </p><p>Based on your limited information, I should suggest +8.50 CLs. </p><p>-5.00 glasses are just strong enough to have some Vertex Distance effects at the Cornea.  The calculations indicate you need +4 to correct your Hyperopia and then another +4.70 to compensate for the -5.00 glasses.  Above about +8.00, CLs only come in 0.50 increments.  I would go with +8.50 CLs and let your Ciliary Muscles make up the small addition al PLUS. </p><p>If you have accommodation issues, It may be necessary to drop down to -4.75 in the GOC glasses. </p><p>Please remember that GOC is not an exact science.  There are no guarantees that the combo will be comfortable. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

I was thinking in the direction of eye misalignment, as the good old 3D images produced their effect by looking through coloured filters at the 3D images.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2018, 21:41</p><p>Soyuz, </p><p>I suspect the contacts sliding out of position may be related to an incorrect base curve. The itchy feeling could be related to the CLs not fitting right.  Also, while you need good tearing action for your CLs to work right, there might be excessive solution trapped between the CL and your Cornea which would allow it to float out of position. </p><p>Were your BC and Diameter professionally prescribed? </p><p>I tried Proclear several years ago for GOC, primarily because of the cost and also found them uncomfortable after a while.  I think they did not have really good moisture or oxygen transmission.  You might try a different brand. </p><p>Another trick you might try if you think there is too much solution trapped between the CL and your Cornea.  After you insert them press very gently on the CL with your solution wetted finger to help them get into position, before you blink. </p><p>Please let me know if any of this makes sense. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soyuz</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2018, 23:26</p><p>Hi Everyone. </p><p> </p><p>I started particularly GOC approx a year ago as I have ordered first prescription glasses from Zenni. Contact lenses are Proclear +15 both side, glasses both with some astigmatism approx -18 both. My eyes are good enough not to wear glasses in everyday life but I felt obsessed with them. I have started with Zenni then I have ordered an other one from Firmoo with same parameters. </p><p> </p><p>Zenni: this is not a myodisc, thick lenses, easy wear, comfortable and adorable. Frame broke after half a year but maybe it was my fault to travel with in case and bag many times. </p><p>Firmoo: I recieved a myodisc with a little bit visible bowl in them (more visible on that side where I have more astigmatism, that side is a little bit thicker as well). Frame quality is good, weight is much less, but smaller frame means less roundview, but viewquality with myodisc seems sharper. </p><p> </p><p>Contacts: sometimes I put them in and in one eye it slides somewhere up on side that I dont know where it is hidden. I have tonwait half day or the night that it slides back again and I can take it out. What is the problem? </p><p>Monthly contacts and they are sometimes itchy after 2-3 hours. </p><p> </p><p>I do it occasionally and secretly, I like the feeling wearing them in public, shopping malls. Mainly stairs are problematic. Not many people starred me on:(  </p><p>I have a glasses with -20, maybe I will order +17 lenses to be able to wear them. I know for GOC it is more adviseable to start with smaller desciption but the feeling is fantastic. Thanks for some advises from this forum and wish u all to have some similar experience.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BrooklynBoy</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2018, 14:04</p><p>JC, </p><p> </p><p>You are right, high plus glasses are very tricky. I found my self not being able to wear them for more than 10 or 15 minutes. Walking around is terrible and I find myself trying to look out of the lenses so i can get a better idea to wear to step. But it is very cool, my eyes are very big and my vision is good, specially close up. I do get somewhat of double vision when looking at distance. </p><p> </p><p>Anyways, I will keep trying. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JC</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2018, 12:05</p><p>Guest -- </p><p> </p><p>The -4 glasses will have an effective power of maybe -3.75 or -3.8 depending on how far they sit from your eyes.  The bigger effect is that wearing the glasses you might have just slightly too much minus power, which depending on your age you probably easily adapt to using a little accommodation -- basically holding a slight focusing tension all the time.  It is probably such a small amount that I doubt you'd notice it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2018, 10:38</p><p>I do full time GOC, I use +2.00 contacts and find that with my own -1.50 prescription I see perfectly well with my -4.00 specs. Does this mean that the +2.00 contacts are effectively more like a +2.50 with them sitting directly on the eye?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JC</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2018, 08:02</p><p>BrooklynBoy -- </p><p> </p><p>I am naturally around -4 and often do GOC to around -10. A few moths ago I started trying GOC to about +5.5.  The adaptation to plus lenses definitely takes longer, especially for you and I who have worn minus lenses for so long.  The relative motion of the image you see when you move your head is more then you expect.  This caused a little motion sickness but within a few hours I was adapted and see everything mostly normal now.  The larger image size can be nice when trying to see something detailed. </p><p> </p><p>In the end I decided I just like minus glasses and myopia better.  I'm 37 so should be on the way towards lower accommodation, but even still wearing the contacts that make me a hyperope at least in bright light I see most things just fine.  I feel much more inhibited even without GOC with my natural myopia.  Even in lower light when as a hyperope everything is real blurred I like howb as a myope I can always get closer to something to see it whereas as a hyperope if I can't accommodate enough to see it then I just can't see it. I also prefer the look of minus lenses.  </p><p> </p><p>Be careful on steps or stepping on or off a curb while wearing the plus lenses!  The step is not as big as it looks to you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BrooklynBoy</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2018, 06:10</p><p>Hi everyone, I want to share a recent experiment that I had with GOC. I have done GOC for quite sometime now, my current RX is -5 and I have done GOC up to -15. I recently decided that I would like to try to wear a + glasses. So after a quick look on the GOC table, I decided to get +8 glasses. Yesterday after my glasses came in, I was able to first experience and enjoy my + combo.  </p><p> </p><p>I found that the magnification was too much to take. I can see things quite clear. I believe that the Combo I ordered is good. But I can't function properly while wearing it. Everything is much closer than what they actually are. </p><p> </p><p>Even though, it was quite an experiment. Anyone here ever tried + GOC? I'm wondering if this is something that my brain has to get used to it.  </p><p> </p><p>Just though I would share this new experience. </p><p> </p><p>By the way, thank you to whoever created the GOC table.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2018, 07:48</p><p>Minusglassesguy, </p><p>Sounds like the combo works pretty well.  One of the things you have to get used to with high prescription glasses is how important it is to look thru the Optical Center (Centre) (OC)of the lenses.  Another is the Barrel Distortion and possible Chromatic Aberration that occurs. </p><p>If you wear the combination a lot, your brain will learn to keep your eyes looking thru the OC and ignore other optical distortions and phenomena. </p><p>Please let us know your experiences. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Minusglassesguy</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2017, 04:36</p><p>Thanks cactus jack.  </p><p>I'm 37 and don't have any trouble with close vision at the moment so a small amount of over correction should be ok. </p><p>I will get back to you with my actual prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2017, 22:02</p><p>Minusglassesguy, </p><p>Here are some preliminary calculations. </p><p>-2.50 glasses have little Vertex Distance (VD) effect.  That means that their effective power at the Cornea is also -2.50 and that your "Eye Power" is +2.50. </p><p>If you wear +8.00 Contacts your effective Eye Power would be +10.50. </p><p>The next step is a bit more mathematically complicated because corrective glasses  will be strong enough for VD effects to be considered..  The complicating factor there is that VD effects are the Square (^2) of the glasses prescription/ divided by 1000 and then multiplied by the VD in mm. </p><p>Because of those steps, the best way to calculate the actual Glasses VD effects are by selecting a Sphere value and doing what is called Successive Approximation to arrive at a glasses Sphere power that is just a little more than -10.50  How little depends on how much accommodation range you have (you age).  If you have plenty of accommodation, we don't have to be very close, we can wind up with more minus in the glasses and your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses can add any attritional PLUS you need.  If Presbyopia is limiting your ability to accommodate, we need to be closer. </p><p>That said, you need to understand the GOC is not a very exact science and there are no guaranteed that we will get it right the first time,  More about that later. </p><p>I have done this enough that I was able to get close with 3 tries. </p><p>-13.00 glasses at 12 mm VD yielded -11.00 at the Cornea. </p><p>-12.50 glasses at 12 mm VD yielded -10.63 at the Cornea. </p><p>=12.25 glasses at 12 mm VD yielded -10.45 at the cornea. </p><p>VD is very hard to measure in practice and impossible to estimate.  You can increase the effective power of MINUS glasses by moving them closer to your eyes </p><p>If you are used to wearing -2.50 glasses, you might want to order Daily wear contact lenses with the appropriate Diameter and Base Curve and low cost glasses from an on like retailer such as Zenni to see how they work.  You may initially notice some Barrel Distortion and Chromatic Aberration or fringing when you start wearing them.  If you have too much trouble you might want to start at a lower level, get used to wearing that, and then move higher. </p><p>May I ask your age? </p><p>Also, sometimes the server is slow to respond.  If you click "Submit" and the background turns blue, your submission is acceptable.  If you click it again, you will get a post for every time you click Submit. </p><p>When you find your prescription, we can refine the calculations. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2017, 13:20</p><p>The calculations are approximate, based Vertex Distance (VD) effects of 12 mm and approximately 0.25 diopters per mm,  Vertex Distance is hard to measure and there is no way to know what your actual VD will be with the glasses.  VD effects for glasses around -15.00 are approximately -2.75 diopters.  VD effects of your actual prescription are about 0.25 diopters at your Corneas </p><p>The calculations suggest that +7.25 in each eye would be appropriate, but I would suggest +7.00 contacts.  At 31, you should be able to  accommodate with the small amount of Plus your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses can provide. </p><p>Please remember that GOC is something of an inexact science and there are no guarantees.  I suggest ordering Daily (1 day) disposable lenses and glasses with the low cost frames and options until you determine if the combination works for you. </p><p>Please let me know how this combination works. </p><p>Also, please try to select a unique nickname </p><p>C.  </p><p></p><hr>

My Rex is L -5.25 and R -5.50 with -1.00 astig both eyes.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2017, 14:49</p><p>juliette </p><p>You didn't say when you're scheduled for your next eye exam but since you wear GOC everyday from morning until night your eyes are clearly adjusted to seeing that way. So I think going in wearing your actual glasses you were prescribed to wear would be a big mistake. You should wear what your eyes are completely used to. Besides now that you have found that you're able to see so well wearing single vision glasses along with your contacts isn't that what you prefer anyway since your glasses are cheaper that way? Your doctor should be able to fine tune your GOC by tweeking either your glasses or contacts a bit. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2017, 18:15</p><p>Charlie_Delta, </p><p>You have the right idea on the GOC.  I think that will be pretty close, but we need to get the new prescription before proceeding. </p><p>If you were considering full time GOC, I might suggest using the same sphere power contact in each eye and doing any necessary adjustments in the glasses.  That saves money and eliminates confusion that might occur with two different power contacts. </p><p>When I could wear contacts, I preferred the Daily Wear disposables over longer wear contacts. </p><p>You can help keep from de conditioning your Ciliary Muscles by wearing less Add for near and/or maybe a little more - for distance, but all you will be doing is slightly delaying the day when your Ciliary Muscles can no longer supply much, if any Plus.  Your Crystalline Lenses are going to get so stiff that your Ciliary Muscles just can't affect their PLUS power. </p><p>BTW, a quick calculation for the extra PLUS you need fo focus near is to divide the distance in Inches into 40.  It is not exact, the actual number is 39.37, but close enough and certainly more convenient. </p><p>I look forward to the results of the exam.  If the ECP reacts favorably to letting you adjust the Axis knob, spring the close focusing idea on him/her and see the reaction.  You might be surprised.  The worst he can do is tell you to take your business elsewhere - very unlikely.  He gets paid for making his customers happy and fulfilling their visual needs. Correctly done GOC is harmless. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Charlie_Delta</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2017, 10:04</p><p>Weirdeyes,  </p><p>Thanks again for tip.  I see the British companies offer monthlies in packs of three and dailies in the usual 30 or 90 packs.  My intent is to shift from monthlies to a daily disposable, so will try Dailies Total-1 and one or two comparables to determine whichever is most comfortable.  I was originally Rx'ed Air Optix Aqua Multifocal, so working from that base curve/diameter.   </p><p> </p><p>Jack, </p><p>Appreciate your offer and will take you up on this.   </p><p> </p><p>Read your "how to study for an eye exam.  Fantastic job on that!!  It will help many others.  Favorite tip you provide is to offer ESP to self-adjust the cylinder knob, though 95% sure I don't need any.     </p><p> </p><p>For me, GOC would be strictly for functional utility.  I'll take a stab at my to-be-issued Rx in two days based on last week's unanticipated "wet" refraction: </p><p> </p><p>OD: +1.25; OS: +0.50; ADD: +1.75 (again, this is, ehem, "speculative") </p><p>Current Rx is OD: +1.00; sph OS: +0.50 -0.25; ADD +1.50 </p><p> </p><p>I work at a computer most days for long hours at a time, but also use a computer at home office on evenings weekends doing my hobby: documentary film and documentary radio story production.  Simply put: close distance demand on my eyes is pretty strong, and becoming exceedingly uncomfortable.  Single-vision glasses at current RX for full-near correction isn't adequate anymore (but they work perfectly for things 30-36" away). </p><p> </p><p>The challenge/question is how soon things would blur if I wore contacts for the full near correction (presuming sphere and ADD both increase about +0.25).  My computer displays are usually no more than 20" away from my eyes, so I think I could get with contact lenses for the full-near correction.  I remain intrigued by ES nickname "Guest" response below however, in which they requested to be refracted for distance after doing just this.    </p><p> </p><p>Using speculative Rx above, I presume the contact lens setup would be OD: +3.00 OS: +2.25 and glasses for distance -1.75 both eyes, ADD +1.50 (and remove glasses if I need to see closer).   </p><p> </p><p>Only thing to add is that I have no interest in deconditioning my eye muscles.  They should be working as much as possible, but not so much as I'm enduring long spans of eye strain and frequent spasms when going near to far. </p><p> </p><p>Charlie </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2017, 16:44</p><p>Charie_Delta, </p><p>Told ya!  You are over the hump and you can do what ever feels comfortable.  Your Sister's and your Mother's comments about fashion reminded of something I read in "Dress for Success".   As best I remember is something like this: "Don't let a woman choose your business attire.  They will choose fashion, rather than attire that fits the role you want to play." </p><p>The same thing applies to glasses.  Choose the frames that complement your facial features and that fit the role you want to play.  Don't ignore fashion completely, but you do the choosing.  </p><p>I have a couple of suggestions. </p><p>1.  Read the piece I wrote "How to Study for and Eye Exam"  I can post it or send it to your email address.  It will help you be an active participant in the exam. </p><p>2. Remind me your most recent complete prescription (before your Friday exam). </p><p>I need to see your prescription so I can offer a suggestion about what to tell the Ophthalmologist. </p><p>I will help you with a "functional" GOC combination based on your prescription and a story to tell the ECP. If he does not want to do it, that is OK.  You can do it anyway, with your new prescription and a little help. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Weirdeyes</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2017, 14:03</p><p>Charlie_Delta </p><p>In Canada you can order contacts in whatever prescription you want on clearly contacts. Too bad you can't order trial lenses as far as I know. I'm thinking of wearing some strong plus glasses over minus colored contacts to be a Harry Potter character. I just need an excuse to try out GOC. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Charlie_Delta</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2017, 12:55</p><p>Thanks Jack, </p><p>The outing occurred inadvertently yesterday amidst a snow storm, driving home from a friend's place.  Forgot I was still wearing glasses when I got home.  Lots of you look so much better in glasses baloney from my nutcase fashion fanatic sisters and mother.  Humorously, brothers and father probably didn't notice I had glasses on. </p><p> </p><p>Guest, </p><p>Again, THANK YOU for posting.  Id much rather wear no vision correction at all, but am a perfectionist with things like optimal vision and have come to realize what works, and what does not.  Monovision is ruled out before even trying this arrangement and multifocal contacts are shockingly sub-par to progressive glasses in terms of optical quality. </p><p> </p><p>Curious why you requested a refraction after trying contacts for your full-near correction?  I assume this is simple math, as Cactus suggests, but perhaps there's more to this that I should be considering.  I have part-2 of a routine series of tests w/ an opthamologist on Friday.  I do this every 3-4 years for a benign condition I have called optic nerve cupping.  I won't be dilated this time and will request a refraction before leaving there to update my script if necessary. </p><p> </p><p>Also curious if you are getting by with single-vision glasses for distance atop your contacts for near?  Your ADD suggests you are not, but I am indeed curious. </p><p> </p><p>Weirdeyes, </p><p>Thanks for the tip.  I havent invested in decent glasses to date and after much trial and error feel confident this GOC arrangement is optimal for me personally. </p><p> </p><p>Id want high-quality lenses/frames measured/adjusted (and kind of insured) through a local optician/shop.  Testing this setup though could be done on the cheap (i.e. Zenni) so thanks for the tip. </p><p> </p><p>On a slight tangent (and please pardon my pontificating): I think the optometry/optician community in the USA has it wrong.  Way too over-regulated IMO.  Brits and other countries let the optician do simple refractions and the consumer purchase contacts without validating Rx, which allows so much more ease in trying other lens brands/types (if they know base curve and lens diameter).  Here in the states, to pull this off would require a litany of visits to an optometrist which, eventually, is probably an out-of-pocket expense even with decent vision insurance.  Makes me wonder how many contact wearers are out there experiencing regular discomfort because of this system.  (side note, I do know my base curve/optimal diameter and just buy low-quantity trial lenses from a company in the UK). </p><p> </p><p>My best, </p><p>Charlie </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Dec 2017, 14:49</p><p>Charlie_Delta, </p><p>I'll bet they are well aware that you need vision correction.  They probably don't know the details, but the symptoms of having contact lenses that are uncomfortable, either physically or optically, are usually pretty obvious. </p><p>I would not be surprised if you were not advised to take out the contacts and get your glasses because your suffering is making people uncomfortable. </p><p>The bottom line is that they really don't care that you now need glasses.  It is sort of a "welcome to the club" thing, but depending on the closeness (e.g. siblings), they might enjoy doing a little (or a lot of) "ribbing". </p><p>I think I like the name "Macrae's Syndrome".  It is so common, it deserves a name. Its being so common is what makes the Saga so funny.  Almost everyone who gets glasses, goes thru it to one degree or another.   </p><p>Turn on your sense of humor and have some fun.  The best way I have found to take the wind out of a person's sails, who wants to give you a good ribbing about needed glasses, is to poke some fun at yourself about being bashful about needing glasses.  Just open up and tell the truth and see what happens.  You can watch the Chief Provoker's face fall when you steal his/her thunder and lead the laughter. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;22 Dec 2017, 23:52</p><p>Charlie_Delta, </p><p>That really should not be to difficult to accomplish.  Many ECPs will do this for you, particularly the younger ones who like to be a bit creative.  </p><p>GOC is commonly used by ECPs in special situations, where there is a substantial difference in each eye's prescription, to adjust the image size on the Retinas.  The ECP should have no problem if you can wear CLs. E.g. No Dry Eye problems.  </p><p>Let me know if I can help.  You know where to find me. </p><p>BTW, when I had to have Cataract Surgery, back in 2001, the Eye Surgeon would not install Multi-Focal IOLs.  He said that people who like very good vision (Engineers, etc.) are not happy with the visual compromises.  So I have single vision IOLs.  Smart man. </p><p>The starting point for GOC is your actual glasses prescription and your CL Diameter and Base Curve.  From there is it just some math.  With a low glasses prescription (less than +/-4.00) it is pretty simple math because Vertex Distance effects are minimal. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;22 Dec 2017, 21:18</p><p>Charlie_Delta  I simply told my Dr that I didn't like monovisaon and asked for two contacts with the correct power for near vision -- in my case, about +4.25.  I then had her refract me for glasses, with the contacts in.  I ended up with -2.5 or so glasses.   </p><p> </p><p>This allows me to read and do close work without glasses, then navigate the office, outside, etc, with my glasses on.     </p><p> </p><p>It works well for me.   </p><p> </p><p>I've also upped the contact lens prescription substantially, along with the appropriate glasses to achieve good GOC of about -5.00. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Weirdeyes</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2017, 20:24</p><p>Charlie_Delta </p><p> </p><p>If the ECP is too stubborn maybe just ask to get your distance prescription prescribed and order the glasses and contacts combo you want online. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Charlie_Delta</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2017, 19:37</p><p>Interested to give GOC a shot.  Ill make no bones about this: I feel old wearing plus glasses with a progressive ADD at age 40.  If I *have* to wear glasses, I rather they not magnify. </p><p> </p><p>Which brings me to my question: anyone know if ECPs in USA willingly prescribe (upon request, obviously) a cockamamie arrangement such as this:  Rx contact lenses for the FULL near correction (sph+ADD) and minus progressive glasses whereby the (minus) glasses sph equals the true ADD, then that value doubles itself in a plus format to bring the progressive ADD essentially back to plano.  i.e. -1.75 sph ADD 1.70 both eyes.  I dont have astigmatism, making this pretty straightforward. </p><p> </p><p>I cant see too many cons to this arrangement other than (a) cost of contacts and (b) need to also have plus lens glasses for times/situations contacts couldnt be worn. </p><p> </p><p>Not sure Id follow through with this idea but do know I cant tolerate multifocal contact lenses (optics too poor) and much prefer the minus lens appearance over lenses that magnify. </p><p> </p><p>And finally, my prescription is stabilizing.  I had to see some opthamologists today for a benign/hereditary eye thing I've had to have checked for 30+ years.  While there with eyes dilated, they did a refraction which revealed only a negligible amount of latent hyperopia remaining (+0.25).  I have to go back there for a dry refraction early next year, but the takeaway is that at this point, I could invest in some good frames/lenses without concern the Rx will change in short order (as it did THREE times this year previously). </p><p> </p><p>Cheers, </p><p>Charlie </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2017, 09:20</p><p>Juliette </p><p>I hope that Cactus Jack is around because he is more of an expert with GOC than I am. But I think the reason you're able to read as well as you can with just single vision glasses now is because the combination of your glasses and contacts is slightly stronger for your near vision now. So it could be that your glasses are a bit too strong and they are over correcting your eyes a bit. That would explain why things seem slightly reduced in size. Generally when doing GOC you want your glasses to be slightly stronger than they need to be anyway.It seems like your eyes have adjusted to your stronger glasses without any problem. But as long as it seems to work and you are a full time GOC wearer you're clearly not doing any harm to your eyes. Even better like you say you're glasses are certainly much more affordable as single vision glasses than bifocals or progressives.  </p><p>So as long as your happy now that you're able to wear strong glasses so well and you have no intention of ever wearing your actual prescription anymore I would suggest that you go for your eye appointment wearing your strong glasses and contacts. By examining your eyes with your contacts on the doctor might be able to refract your eyes and prescribe you with even a more accurate pair of glasses. Of course i'm sure that you have no intention of buying your glasses from your doctor unless insurance pays for them. </p><p>You seem to be very open about doing GOC with not only people in here but even your local friends as well. So i;m sure your doctor is going to wonder why you want to wear such strong glasses but he or she won't tell you not to do it because you're in no way doing any harm to your eyes. So you simply tell them that your partner wears strong glasses and you have always liked how his glasses looked so you also wanted to wear strong glasses and found this way of doing it and you like how you look wearing strong glasses.  </p><p>You didn't say if your friend ever started doing GOC. If i recall she was only wearing -1.25 glasses but she liked how your glasses looked and wanted to do the same.    </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2017, 11:10</p><p>julieette </p><p>To be honest I didn't recall our previous comments from last year until you reminded me. You always admired your husband's strong glasses and wished that your glasses were as strong. You were excited to here about GOC as an option and with the help of Cactus Jack in figuring out the proper combination for  for contacts and glasses for your eyes you were soon wearing GOC as a full time option and loving it. It only took a short time for your eyes to fully adjust to your new GOC vision and you were seeing even better than you ere with your actual prescribed glasses. Wearing stronger glasses has had a other effects on you as well. You're now much more self confident and self assured. Wearing stronger glasses has made you a stronger woman. One of you first comments I found very interesting.You said "I now feel and look as though I need glasses" Interesting because you had already been wearing glasses for many years.  </p><p>I remember you had a friend that after seeing you wearing your stronger glasses was so impressed that she wanted to do GOC too. You said her actual prescription was around -1.50. Did she ever start doing GOC? If so how is she doing?  </p><p>I don't know what prescription Zenni will make myodisk lenses at. Zenni has a open chat line. I would suggest making up a story about a friend that wears myodisk glasses and you really like how they look and your just curious at what prescription is where myodisk is used.  </p><p>    </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

In the Europe this is not problem.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>juliette</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2017, 01:13</p><p>Soundmanpt, You may remember that I started GOC about a year ago with advice from this website. Yes, I had been wearing glasses or lenses for many years, but with a modest plus prescription. I started at -9.00, &amp; now at -12.00 with little or no problems. I use the combination of lenses/ glasses daily. Its great, &amp; somewhat addictive, &amp; as I have said previously, I &amp; my husband like the way I look. I find that my vision is much more clear &amp; crisp with the GOC combo than with my 'True' glasses. How is that possible? </p><p>The small amount of minification has not proved to be a problem for me. As I said in a previous post, &amp; like Sarah I would just like to try a pair of Myodiscs, just to see what they are like to wear, but I don't think -12.00 is enough yet to get myodiscs. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2017, 17:16</p><p>Thanks Soundmanapt. </p><p> </p><p>I wonder what the lowest Rx Zenni would make myodiscs at? </p><p> </p><p>I don't want to go too crazy high like -18, I want to be able to wear them, I also don't want my eyes to be quite so minimized and hidden in the rings</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2017, 09:41</p><p>julliette </p><p>Were you already a glasses wearer when you started doing GOC or did you start doing GOC so you could start wearing glasses? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2017, 09:39</p><p>Sarah, </p><p>If you want to do GOC, I urge you to learn how to do the calculations, they are not very difficult,  I also urge you to try a GOC combination around -10 before working up to higher glasses values. </p><p>The thing that primarily affect the GOC powers is Vertex Distance effects.  It is the mathematical Square of the glasses prescription.  It has little effect below about -4.50, but becomes very significant above about -10 as you will see with the following calculations. </p><p>Sphere and Cylinder calculations are done separately, but your Cylinder correction is so low, all you have to do is transfer the Cylinder and Axis to the glasses prescription WITHOUT any changes. </p><p>Vertex Distance (VD) effects of Sphere -15 </p><p>-15 x -15 = 225 (note that the sign is now +, but don't worry about that, all we want is the absolute value. </p><p>Next divide by 1000 </p><p>225/1000 = 0.225 That is the VD effect. 0.225 diopters per mm </p><p>Next, multiply by the distance from the front surface of the cornea to the back of the glasses, this is the Vertex Distance.  It is very hard to measure accurately, but typically is is 10 to 12 mm.  Lets assume 12. </p><p>Total VD effect </p><p>0.225 x 12 = 2.70 diopters. </p><p>What to do with that number is a bit tricky.  It depends on whether the glasses have - lenses or + lenses.  In your case with - lenses, you SUBTRACT the 2.70 from the -15 to determine the effective optical power of the -15 glasses at the Cornea. </p><p>-15.00 minus 2.70 = -12.30  That is the calculated power of the -15.00 lenses at your Cornea.  If your prescription was 0.00  You would need +12.00 Contact Lenses.  The reason for +12.00 is that you can only buy high power contact in 0.50 increments and it is best to use contacts that are a little less plus than you need so your Ciliary Muscles can add a bit of extra PLUS to compensate, assuming you still have some accommodation left. </p><p>Now we need to adjust the CL power for your actual refractive error and that can affect the choices you have. </p><p>You posted the following actual prescription: </p><p>L -5.00 0.25 18 </p><p>R -4.75 0.75 085 </p><p>Ignore the Cylinder and Axis for now. </p><p>Remember, normal Glasses or Contact prescriptions Neutralize or Cancel Out your actual refractive error.  That means that your ACTUAL Sphere Refractive Error is: </p><p>L +4.75  </p><p>R +4.50 </p><p>Adjusted for VD effects and rounded to nearest power availability. </p><p>You have a built in, head start on the Plus CL prescription for -15 glasses.  The required contacts would be: </p><p>L +12.00 minus +4.75 = +7.25 </p><p>R +12.00 minus +4.50 = +7.50 </p><p>I think I would use +7.25 or +7.00 CLs in both eyes and let my ciliary muscles compensate.  An alternative would be to slightly adjust the Sphere prescription in the glasses. </p><p>Using the above as a template you can do the calculations for any desired glasses prescription. </p><p>I don't know at what prescription Myodiscs become necessary, but I believe it is around -18 to -20 using CR-39. </p><p>Please remember that GOC is NOT an exact science and is highly sensitive to VD effects. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>juliette</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2017, 01:44</p><p>Hi Sarah, </p><p>It sounds as though you want your glasses looking stronger by using GOC as they call it. I am the same, &amp; since about this time last year, I have managed to get to -12 with very few problems. I like it very much, &amp; how I look. I too would like to try some myodisc lenses to see what its like, &amp; how I look in them.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2017, 08:07</p><p>juliette </p><p>I would agree with "rafa" and depending where you live you might even wnt to call them and ask at what prescription you can have have your glasses made with myodisk lenses? Or use the "comment" box to request myodisk lenses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2017, 02:36</p><p>Juliette, </p><p> </p><p>I got myself a pair of myodisc glasses from Zenni. They are minus 20, which is as high as they make them at Zenni. </p><p> </p><p>I actually didn't want myodisc lenses but since I order the thickest lenses (as I like them), It turns out that they only fill that sort of prescription on regular lenses with myodiscs. I'm very happy with them now. </p><p> </p><p>So my guess is that if you go for really high prescriptions, Zenni might be able to do myodiscs for you. But it's best to ask them first.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JC</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2017, 15:26</p><p>Maxim: </p><p> </p><p>I see what you mean. With your family's interest in glasses and your history of moving to a very low prescription I can see the danger in showing up with a significant prescription one day.  I suppose I'm lucky nobody in my family has a special interest in glasses and they all know I am a full time wearer. And of course I'm lucky my wife knows about and accepts GOC. </p><p> </p><p>While I don't make any effort to avoid wearing any particular glasses in front of them I do avoid any situation where I might have to remove them in front of them. My sister in particular knows my prescription is the same as hers as several years ago she needed to borrow a disposable lens from me. It would be awkward if she suddenly saw me with much worse vision then herself.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2017, 04:25</p><p>PS to JC: </p><p> </p><p>After the OP, I have not only the two varifocals (bought one month and 8 months after OP, not satisfied with the concept, always blurry zones) but as well: </p><p> </p><p>1 pair bifocals PC and near vision (that is +1.25/+2.75 against distance vision) - bought them 2 weeks after OP -  </p><p> </p><p>1 pair bifocals distance and near vision (o.oo / + 2.75) - superb from Zenni, at a total price of 40,00 $ approx., 20,00 the frame, less than 20,00 $ the bifocal lenses with antireflex - superb quality and vision !! bought 4 months after OP </p><p> </p><p>1 pair for distance vision, sunlight absorption 80 per cent, brown, for driving - bought them 2 weeks after OP -</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2017, 04:16</p><p> </p><p>to JC: </p><p> </p><p>Thank you very much for your friendly remarks and comments. </p><p> </p><p>My real prescription was until May/June of 2016: </p><p> </p><p>R + 4.00 / - 1.75 cyl A 85 degrees,  </p><p>L + 3.25 / - 1.25 cyl A 110 degrees  </p><p>with an add of 2.00 or 2.25 etc. </p><p> </p><p>In early summer of 2016 I had the cataract OP, and I paid for the state-of-the-art measurement, and so, after the cataract OP (I did not pay for tailored-to-measure IOLs), only the astigmatism is more or less uncorrrected. </p><p> </p><p>My new prescription is (slightly modified over the months, and slightly different in three different shops - I have an appointment for 'objective' measurement): </p><p> </p><p>R + 0.50 / - 2.00 A 103 degrees, and </p><p>L - 0.50 / -0.50  A 102 degrees, and, of course, an add for near vision. </p><p> </p><p>This is really near nothing (especially in the left eye), but however, I enjoy wearing glasses, because there is more sharpness in the image. An example only: a car registration plate on 50 yards/meters: without glasses left eye blurred, right eye nothing or totally in blur. </p><p> </p><p>With glasses: can read the registration plate, left eye superb, right eye, fairly good. Why should I NOT wear glasses??? I prefer seeing WITH glasses! </p><p> </p><p>All of my family are glasses lovers and glasses experts of their own. My wife wished desperately to wear glasses, when she was young and did not really need them. She loved her children wearing glasses, and me as well. Everybody is trying the other's glasses, and everybody in the family knows about the other family members' prescriptions.  </p><p> </p><p>When I first had new glasses affter the cataract OP, I told my son (now 31 yrs) that my prescription now was near to nothing, and he took my glasses, looked through them and then confirmed, what I had said. </p><p> </p><p>So, quite frankly, do you agree, that they might be on the alert, if I would show up with my -5.00 prescription glasses over CLs? </p><p> </p><p>By the way, before the OP, I wore -8.00 over +5.00 CLs. And now, my +6.00 glasses are a pair of reading glasses, when my eye was at +4.00 etc before the OP. These are the only glasses, were they don't ask - I can also use glasses before the OP (+4.00 etc) from before the OP as readers, but they are for very, very close vision now!  </p><p> </p><p>I'm planning for some nice Zenni bifocals with -7.50 etc, as +8.00 CLs are the maximum power to buy at reasonable prices (30-40 cent each) as throw-away lenses from www.daysoft.com , but I am also planning for more glasses around my real prescription (variation in power, cylinder, a bit of prism etc., and bifocals for distance and near, bifocals for PC screen and near - this is very important -).

<p><b>JC</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2017, 14:56</p><p>Maxim:  If I understood correctly you do wear glasses with a real prescription when not doing GOC? May I ask what your actual prescription is?  If so then if you get GOC glasses with the same frame I don't think you have to worry about your family catching you.  My own glasses are -4 and I regularly wear -9 and nobody can tell the difference -- even my wife who knows that I switch between the two.  I even showed up with +5 glasses in front of her and she never saw a difference, which gave me confidence to wear them in front of other people with whom an explanation would be more complicated then with her.  Outside of our community and eye care professionals people just don't pay attention to such things.  I also would be very surprised if anyone other then an ECP noticed contacts under glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2017, 13:01</p><p> </p><p>A small amendment: I regularely doing both, hyperop and myop simulation, with +6.00 or - 5.00 glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Just three days ago, I did a 300 miles car ride plus customer talks with the -5.00 glasses and + 5.00 CLs on the eyes (this is the deviation, the exact values are based on my actual prescription. </p><p> </p><p>One remark only: I feel, that the contact lenses on the eyes are much easier to detect with plus glasses, as they have a substantial magnifying effect. With the +6.00 glasses, this effect might be an estimated 150 percent. </p><p> </p><p>With glasses for myopia, this is the opposite effect, the eyes are an estimated 60 percent in size with -5.00 glasses. </p><p> </p><p>If somebody would ask me, why I am wearing glasses PLUS contact lenses, I would just say, that the lenses are soaked with an antibiotic medication, this is my idea at least. </p><p> </p><p>My experience is, that walking and driving seems to be easier with the minus glasses (-5.00), and more difficult with the plus glasses. Until now, I have been driving the car without problems with the minus glasses, but I never used the plus glasses for driving (with one exception many, many years ago from London to Manchester, with +7.00 then). The plus glasses I have been using in town, in the subway or for many, many hours in long distance trains. I always forgot after minutes only, that I am wearing glasses, it's quite natural for me, and I have to be careful not to return to my family home still wearing those "odd" -5.00 or + 6.00 glasses - nobody at home knows about my 'obsession'.  </p><p> </p><p>I had started GoC when I was studying business, especially international business. As a student, I wrote to companies in Hongkong for CL samples and glasses samples, pretending I would act on behalf of European companies interested in business with these objects. Sometimes I bought glasses with lenses, complete for less than a Dollar per pair, when our companies had already trade relations with them and sold for 50 or 100 Dollars.  Even Zenni is not really cheap, as Chinese exporters sell nowadays as cheap as 20 cent per standard lens.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2017, 10:05</p><p>Sallust, the others gave you good advice. I will only add a couple of thoughts. First, if you have no particular preference for plus or minus glasses, go with the minus glasses because, for a given prescription strength, they are easier to wear. This is especially true for high prescriptions, where strong plus lenses limit your vision in ways, mostly peripheral vision, that no amount of practice will reduce. Minus lenses don't really do this. </p><p> </p><p>I'm not sure that all the 'experts' here (none of us a really experts) have experience in GOC, but the prevailing wisdom seems to be to start with weaker scripts and work up. While that might be easier in some ways, it's also expensive. My experience, for what it's worth, was to start with +20 glasses right out of the gate. It took several weeks to get used to them, but I did. The high minus glasses I tried took much less time for me to get used to. YMMV</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2017, 07:59</p><p>Thanks JC, </p><p>You have been paying attention and the information you provided Sallust is excellent. </p><p>Sallust, </p><p>We can help you, but I have a couple of questions and suggestions. </p><p>1 Where do you live? I need the country because it affects my suggestions. </p><p>2. What is your occupation. GOC suggestions are affected by your visual environment. </p><p>.Initial suggestions. </p><p>1. You need an eye exam. If you have a refractive error, I suspect it will be small.  Your actual complete prescription is the starting place for GOC. </p><p>2. Before getting an eye exam, you need to do two things: </p><p>  A. Read "how to Study for an Eye Exam".  I think you can find it here or on the Vision and Spex site. IF you cannot, I will re-post it here. </p><p>  B. Do the simple home refraction test.  That will give us an idea of your approximate sphere refractive error, but it cannot provide any real estimate of any Astigmatism. </p><p>If you do the above, that will help determine the symptoms or complaints to mention to the Examiner the you go for the exam.  Once we know your actual refractive error (is any) we can suggest what to do about finding out two very important things, what Base Curve (BC) and the Diameter (DIA) you need in contact lenses.  Soft Contact Lenses are pretty forgiving, but if they are too tight or too loose, they will be uncomfortable to wear and potentially damaging to the Cornea. </p><p>Please be aware that GOC is NOT and inexpensive endeavor, but once you get past the initial stuff listed above, the expenses are not ridiculous, unless you do it wrong.  Whatever you do, DO NOT buy existing glasses with the idea of finding contact lenses to make them wearable.  That rarely works because of the possible difference between your Cylinder and Axis (if any) and Cylinder and Axis in the glasses. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JC</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2017, 06:53</p><p>Sallust: </p><p> </p><p>Here are my personal experiences at different correction levels.  Your experience will be somewhat different then mine for a few reasons.  First I am 37 and you are 19, which means I will have less accommodation available and hyperopia will have more of a bite.  Secondly I am naturally nearsighted around -4.  As Cactus Jack puts it this means my brain already has been programmed to see with minus glasses and I don't notice effects you might.  My brain is not programmed to see with plus glasses meaning what I see is likely exaggerated. </p><p> </p><p>+5 glasses:  When first pitting in the contacts everything is very blurred, but within maybe 20 seconds or so my distance vision adapts fairly well.  Without glasses in typical indoor lighting I can see distances okay, but it takes a noticeable concentration and effort.  Reading is mostly not possible unless the text is large.  In bright outside lighting after a while I can almost forget my distance vision is impaired.  Reading might be possible with great effort, squinting, and probably a headache.  With glasses everything is clear of course, and much bigger then what I am used to.  I have to be careful on steps because they are actually smaller then they appear to me.  The apparent motion when I move my head is not what I am used to and this sometimes causes a little motion sickness. </p><p> </p><p>-4 glasses:  I can not see distance objects clearly nor making out any writing more then a foot or so from me unless it is very large.  I can easily identify blurred objects and most people wouldn't know I am hindered unless I had to read or identify a person from a distance.  I can not read a book or phone from a "normal" reading distance, but I don't have to bring them so close as to be noticed by most people.  If I were to try to read a computer screen I would be leaning in close enough that anyone around me would know something is up.  With glasses I can not really give you a good idea of what it is like as this has always been my normal reality. </p><p> </p><p>-9 glasses:  Everything is very blurred regardless of distance.  I can recognize most large objects by color and shape but smaller objects (like glasses for example) might be hard to locate unless I am quite close to them.  In bright daylight I can walk around and navigate well, but at dusk or nighttime I feel helpless. To read anything I will hold it so close to my eyes, possibly closing one of them, that anyone around would immediately know I have a serious vision problem.  With glasses again I can not give you a great description as this is normal for me, other then to say everything will be a little smaller and it may be harder to make out small text at a large distance due to the size rather then the blurriness.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JC</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2017, 06:11</p><p>Sallust: </p><p> </p><p>Some of resident experts here, notably Cactus Jack, will be able to help you out with calculations, power suggestions, etc.  The first step will be to get a contact lens fitting. </p><p> </p><p>As far as your decision between minus and plus glasses goes, that of course is up to you by my suggestion would be plus contacts and minus glasses.  You said with plus glasses you would limit yourself to around +5.  Since you are 19 you should still have substantial natural accommodation, which means when you wear minus contacts without glasses to simulate hyperopia your eyes will neutralize a great deal of the power themselves.  Yes when you first put them on your vision will be blurred, reading will be difficult if possible at all, and you might get eye strain and headaches.  But all in all you will likely be able to adapt and see okay.  If you go the other route and choose plus contacts to simulate myopia then without glasses there will be nothing you can do to see better other then get close to objects or wear glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Our experts will also warn you about starting with too high a prescription.  Since you have never needed corrected lenses going from nothing to strong glasses could be too much in one step.  Listen to what they say, they are experienced and have helped many of our members achieve what they have been looking for. </p><p> </p><p>Best of luck. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sallust</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2017, 03:55</p><p>I've contemplated GOC many times but never actually indulged beyond wearing some drug store readers briefly.  I'm 19 so there is a bit of an error margin to work with, luckily.  I had my eyes examined last several years ago and I had 20/20 or near 20/20.  Even if I could have gotten glasses they would've been a miserably paltry -.5D or so, ones wich I would be ashamed to wear.   </p><p>So I've got a blank slate.  I've been lurking around for qiite a while and am familiar with the realities and limitations.   </p><p>Here are some of my questions: </p><p>1. I am not sure which would be more satisfying, plus lenses or minus lenses.  I appreciate both, but plus starts heavily distorting around 5/6D and minus takes until upwards of 10D before the specs begin to look strong IMO. (I'm leaning towards plus specs, minus lenses, unless there is an issue with that.) </p><p>2. I don't know the calculations, so a couple pointers and tips would be nice. </p><p>3. more about how it looks to be hyperopic without with and without correction, and if it is at all possible to get a amblyopic effect simply through two different Rxs. </p><p>4. I've been a glasses admirer for years, but never a wearer, so just general thoughts on how to choose an Rx that is satisfying both in the mirror and behind the lenses. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2017, 21:58</p><p>Lurking, </p><p>I believe your GOC combination has more MINUS than is required and you are Over Corrected.  You did not mention your age, but I suspect you are compensating for the excess MINUS, by using your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses to add some PLUS internally. </p><p>There is an interconnection between your Focus Control System and your Eye Position Control System that causes your eyes to converge when you try to focus close.  The systems do no know if the additional PLUS is for focusing close or you are compensating for over correction, and your eyes try to converge or cross and you see double. </p><p>I will help you with the calculations, but I need your age, occupation, and your COMPLETE actual prescription. </p><p>It is subject to revision, but a "back of an envelope" calculation indicates that you have about -2.25 diopters too much MINUS in your GOC combination. If you are young enough, you should be able to deal with the extra -2.25. The double vision might go away if you can learn to not respond to the over correction, perhaps with some exercises. Or, you can get prism (probably Base Out) in your glasses.  You might be able to find out how much prism you need by doing the Simple Prism Test described on the Vision and Spec' website. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lurking</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2017, 20:15</p><p>Given the current topic, I figured this would be good time and thread to share my recent and very first time with GOC with high plus glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>My real rx is -4.00, the contacts are -20.00 and my glasses are +12.00. VERY exciting from my perspective, with only 2 minor problems that I hope improve with time. First, I think I may have gotten contacts that are a diopter or so too strong because seeing close objects can be a real challenge. </p><p> </p><p>The other issue a bit more annoying. With my contacts in and glasses on I can see quite clearly as long as I keep one eye closed or else I see double. One of my eyes even crosses. Will this go away after some time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2017, 08:29</p><p>Davey, </p><p>I think you should start with less than +18, but here are the suggested numbers. </p><p>Your current prescription: </p><p>R Sph -0.50 Cyl -0.25 Ax 130 Add 2.50 </p><p>L Sph -0.50 Cyl -0.50 Ax 25. Add. 2.50 </p><p>Desired Glasses Sphere: +18.00 </p><p>Estimated Vertex Distance; 12 mm </p><p>18.00^2 = 324 /1000 = 0.324 x 12 = 3.89 </p><p>Vertex Distance effects of PLUS glasses are increased at the Cornea. Therefore, the effective power of the Glasses at the Cornea are: </p><p>+18.00 + 3.89 = +21.89 </p><p>Your current Sphere eye power is +0.50 (reverse of the -0.50) for a total of +22.39. </p><p>Theoretically, you will need -22.39 contacts.  However, there are two complicating factors. </p><p>One: You probably cant get contacts in 0.25 increments. You might be able to get either -22.00 or -22.50, but I suspect it will not be easy or inexpensive. </p><p>Two: At 57 you have very little accommodation.  That means that you cannot internally add any compensating PLUS. That means that the GOC combination needs to be pretty close or maybe a little on the PLUS side (IOW the -22.00 contacts. Less MINUS is more PLUS).  Because the VD effects are significant, you may be able to compensate by adjusting the glasses slightly. </p><p>Please remember also that GOC at high prescriptions is a very inexact science and there are no guarantees, ever. </p><p>Your GOC glasses prescription with the -22.00 contacts needs to be: </p><p>R Sph +18.00 Cyl -0.25 Ax 130 Add 2.50 </p><p>L Sph +18.00 Cyl -0.50 Ax 25. Add. 2.50 </p><p>I suggest, in addition to site down when you try the combination, that you take some motion sickness pills a half hour before trying them.  At alternative is having a container handy in case you have motion sickness because of the radical difference between what your eyes perceive  and what your semi-circular organs sense. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Davey</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2017, 13:29</p><p>Hi Cactus Jack, I don't have my prescription to hand until tomorrow but I did use the old calculator years ago to get into -27.50 glasses with +20.00 contact lenses which I wore straight away with no problems, as the years have passed the glasses are probably -1.00 diopter too strong as I move them down my nose a little bit for distance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2017, 11:57</p><p>Davey, </p><p>It is an Excel file, I have misplaced the link, but many people have stopped using it in preference to doing the calculations by hand.  GOC is not a very exact science, particularly when there are significant changes between the actual prescription and a GOC combo.  High prescriptions are very touchy because of very significant Vertex Distance effects. Doing the calculations by hand helps you get acquainted with the underlying optical principles. </p><p>We will be happy to help you with the calculations, but we need to start with your Actual complete prescription, your age, where you live, and your target glasses prescription. </p><p>Vision occurs in the brain, your eyes are merely biological cameras.  Significant changes in prescription usually means that your brain has to learn how to process the new images. With rare exceptions, most people with a natural high prescription  have learned how to process the images delivered to the visual cortex gradually, over a period of years.  For that reason, it is best to start GOC with a small change and work up to your target glasses prescription. </p><p>That does not mean that you cannot start with a big change, but if not done carefully, it can be a hazardous experience, particularly going to a significant PLUS prescription.  Loss of peripheral vision can mean missed curbs and stair steps.  Also, there can be significant changes in apparent speed of motion when you move your head, which causes motion sickness. </p><p>Please let us help make your GOC adventures, pleasant ones. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2017, 08:58</p><p>Tyrion Lannister, </p><p>You seem very determined to jump into the deep end of the ocean/pool before learning to swim.  Of course people do it and you hear about their "adventures" on the evening news. </p><p>On 5 June, Specs4ever posted this paragraph: </p><p>The contact lenses would be +16.00 for the sphere and there is no cylinder or axis. You should have your eyes checked by a doctor to see if you can get a pair of contact lenses with no prescription in them - with the excuse that you want to change your eye color or something like that. Contact lenses come in a base curve(BC) and a diameter (DIA) and should be measured by an eye care professional to make sure you do not damage your eyes by wearing contact lenses that do not fit properly. </p><p>Soft contact lenses are pretty forgiving, but they need to have a Base Curve and Diameter to fit the curvature of your Cornea.  Your Cornea is living tissue, but it has NO BLOOD SUPPLY.  The Cornea gets its Oxygen from the air and Oxygen and nutrients from your tears. Contacts are supposed to float on a constantly refreshed film of tears. If contacts don't fit properly, the Cornea will be starved for Oxygen and nutrients and be uncomfortable and possibly dangerous to wear. </p><p>Getting the color change contact does two things: 1.  you find out the BC and DIA and 2. You get instruction in how to care for the lenses and insert and remove them.  Both are very good to know. The first time you insert a contact lens, you have to overcome the natural aversion to sticking your finger in your eye.  Your finger does not actually touch your Cornea, the contact lens does.  Imagine the panic when you discover that you don't know how to safely remove the contact lenses, particularly if they won't come out.  It is actually pretty easy, but you have to know how to do it. </p><p>I don't recall if you said where you live (country).  That is important information because suggestions can vary depending on where you live. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>juliette</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2017, 02:38</p><p>Hello Soundmanpt &amp; CJ, </p><p>Thank you for your advice again to increase the strength of the glasses further. I will follow the proposal you have given, &amp; update you when I start with the new combination. If all goes well I would at a later date like to try some myodiscs, but I don't know what increase I would need to get this type of lense? this is more for fun, but who knows. The whole experience is rather addictive, &amp; as I have said before, it gives me a good feeling of feeling self assured. Comments by family &amp; friends are all positive. Monthly lenses up to +20 can be obtained from Lenscatalogue.co.uk at discounted prices. </p><p>Thanks to you both for your supportive advice.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2017, 01:39</p><p>Juliette </p><p> </p><p>Yes, I remember your story, as it seems like a dream story for many of us here, being able to GOC all day with the support of your significant one. </p><p> </p><p>I was wondering, what was the reaction of your friends and your relatives as they saw you  move from moderate plus glasses to very strong minus glasses? Did they notice? I remember you mentioned you told a friend of yours that you were actually GOC'ing, and she seemed interested in doing that herself. But what about the rest?

<p><b></b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2017, 18:20</p><p>Thanks Soundmanpt.  That would have been my first question and I appreciate your helping out. </p><p>Juliette, </p><p>Based on your prescription of </p><p>OD +2.50, -.25 x 140 add +3.00 </p><p>OS +2.50, -.50 x 40 add +3.00 </p><p>It is obvious that you do not have much accommodation remaining.  That means that we must be more careful about choosing the combo.  You asked for -12.00 glasses, that results in a contact lens prescription of +12.75, which is not available because contact lenses above about +/- 8 only come in 0.50 increments.  I would suggest ordering glasses with the following prescription: </p><p>OD -12.25, -.25 x 140 add +3.00 </p><p>OS -12.25, -.50 x 40 add +3.00 </p><p>and order +13.00 contact lenses. </p><p>Please remember that GOC is NOT an exact science and there are no guarantees.  I suggest considering ordering some very inexpensive single vision glasses to try with the +13.00 contacts and see if you like the results.  If they are satisfactory, then order bifocals or progressives in a nice frame. </p><p>Please let us know the results. </p><p>Remember that your actual +2.50 prescription complicates GOC as you go higher on top of the complications caused by simply going to very high prescriptions. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2017, 09:03</p><p>juliette </p><p>Glad to see that you are so happy doing GOC on an everyday basis. Being able to wear stronger glasses really seems to have provided you with a new self confidence. I researched back and found your earliest post in here and it was on November 29th 2016. Your partner wears strong glasses and you wanted you both wanted your glasses to look as strong. Cactus Jack provided you with the proper combination which I assume is what you used for your contacts and glasses. I am going to post your actual prescription because i'm certain that would be the first thing Cactus Jack would need in order to recommend the proper combination for stronger glasses.  </p><p>OD +2.50 -.25 140 / OS +2.50 -.50  40 add +3.00.  </p><p>You also mentioned that you had a friend that was so impressed with your glasses that she also wanted to do GOC Her actual prescription was around -1.50. has she started wearing GOC? It has gotten a good bit more difficult to order contacts. Where do you get your contacts from?  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gocer</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2017, 03:48</p><p>It's a bit of trial and error Juliette, it depends what your natural accommodation is like as my eyes can accommodate glasses from -14 to -20 wearing +12.5 lenses but of course I have to  have the glasses half way down my nose to allow for this. I think this is referred to as vertex, i.e. the distance between your eyeball or in this case, the contact lenses, and the glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>I have just got a couple of pairs of -18's and yesterday picked up some +14 contacts from my local optician and wore them for about 8 hours yesterday then a couple of hours this morning. Despite never having tried this combo before it worked like a dream and felt incredibly natural. I even managed to drive for about 45 minutes to the shops and it felt no different to being bare eyed so for those that say you need to feel you way into and gradually move your way up I would say do what YOU feel comfortable with as for doing GOC with -9 glasses now feels incredibly boring! </p><p> </p><p>As you are increasing by -3 diopters I wouldn't increase your contact lenses by +3 as my above maths showed I went from a +12.5 with -15 glasses to +14 with -18 glasses and it worked perfectly. I would suggest you increase by +1.5 diopters and see how you go.</p><p></p><hr>

It has not been at all difficult except some dizziness the first couple of days.

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2017, 09:41</p><p>Tyrion, CJ is right about the cyl. Just forget the astigmatism part. It will be very hard to get good vision with that combo. </p><p> </p><p>And S4E is right, just go for it. The first few hours will be difficult, but you'll be surprised how quickly your visual cortex compensates and adjusts for the different visual experience. It's a whole lot cheaper than working your way up in power, and it isn't that hard. Just don't plan to drive right away ;-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2017, 08:49</p><p>Tyrion, if you have no need for glasses, and you wish to wear -20D glasses you will need +16.00D contacts to enable you to wear them. There is a bit of flexibility here. If you are under 35 I suspect that you could get away with +15.00D contacts. But if you are an old guy like me, the ability to focus is lost and you have to be more precise.  The tables call for +16D at a vertex distance of 12.5mm. If you wear your glasses closer then you need more plus power. If you wear your glasses further away then you need less plus - for example the table calls for +15.75D at 13.5mm. But the higher power contacts generally only come in 0.50D steps. </p><p>When you get your combination and put the contacts in for the first time the feeling will blow your mind. It will be a little like being seasick and you will probably get a bit disoriented and dizzy.  However the more you wear the combination the easier it becomes and after a few days of doing this you will put the contacts in and the glasses on and you will feel just like normal. Even the minimization will become normal. </p><p>I probably would suggest starting off with a lower prescription, but the experimentation is expensive. This will work, and you will adapt to it after a few trips(and it really does seem like a bit of a trip). Good luck.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2017, 18:26</p><p>TyrionLannister, </p><p>Yes, but I strongly suggest that you should NOT start GOC at that level, particularly if you do not presently require vision correction.  High prescription GOC, requires sophisticated calculations and even then it is NOT an exact science. </p><p>When you get glasses with a prescription above about +/- 5 you have to adjust contact lens powers for Vertex Distance effects. </p><p>For example, a plus contact lens for work with -18 glasses WOULD NOT be +18.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2017, 01:24</p><p>TyrionLannister </p><p>Bad move for GOC.   </p><p>It is theoretically, but practically impossible to get or fit a contact lens that would compensate for glasses with that prescription and give you functional vision.  The problem is the Cylinder and Axis correction in the glasses.  It would require custom made Toric Contact lenses which are expensive and typically hard to fit. A spherical lens is shaped like a section from the side of a glass ball.  A cylinder lens is shaped like a section from the side of a glass rod.  The axis is the angular direction of the long axis of that section.  Cylinder and axis ALWAYS go together.  The angular direction of the axis is specified by tradition. 0 degrees is horizontal.  90 degrees is vertical.  Looking at the patient, the numbers increase in a counter clockwise direction from 0 to 179 or 1 to 180. 0 and 180 are the same horizontal axis.  Numbers above 180 are never used. </p><p>You have a bit to learn about how vision and optics work.  Vision actually occurs in the brain, your eyes are merely biological cameras.  If you have never required vision correction, suddenly going from no correction to a very high prescription is extremely difficult, but it can be done.  People with natural high myopia did not get that way suddenly.  It typically required years starting in childhood and ultimately getting to -18 or more in their late teens or early 20s at a rate of about 1.00 diopters per year. </p><p>Poorly executed GOC can be uncomfortable and expensive.

<p><b></b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2017, 11:04</p><p>Miku, </p><p>You might find using +5.50 contacts or increasing the glass prescription by -0.25 will provide crisper vision.  That will be a slight over correction, but at your age, you should be able to easily compensate. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JC</b>&nbsp;10 May 2017, 08:26</p><p>CJ: </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for the suggestion regarding motion sickness medication.  I'll keep that in mind if I decide to go stronger.  Unfortunately I had to work later that day.  My job is very safety sensitive and taking anything which might have a sedating effect is not allowed. </p><p> </p><p>I was walking around an unfamiliar city with the +5 combination and decided to take the glasses off and keep them in my shirt pocket for a "bare eyed" experience (not really bare eyed as I was wearing strong minus contacts).  After about a mile and half of walking I reached in my pocket and found they were gone.  I retraced my steps twice looking for them to no avail, so unfortunately they are a write off.  They were about $15 total on Zenni so no big financial loss but I would have liked to use them for more then 2 days.  Later I thought of another advantage farsighted people have over nearsighted... OTC readers for emergency use.  I got a pair of +3.25 for $1.50.  My vision is perfectly comfortable with them, at least for the short time I have been using them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;09 May 2017, 08:42</p><p>Robert, </p><p>Sorry to be so slow in responding to your last post.  I missed it.  If you are still having dry eye problems, I suggest considering a lubricating eye drop that contains Carbxyomethylcellulose sodium 0.5% as an active ingredient. I don't know what is available where you live.  The Refresh Plus brand in the US is available in single use containers that are very handy and also small bottles. You may find a "house" brand with similar ingredients at a lower price. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;09 May 2017, 08:27</p><p>JC, </p><p>Motion Sickness is primarily caused by a difference between the motion you see and the motion you feel. Minus glasses act like Wide Angle lenses and Plus glasses act, like you said, as binoculars.  With Minus glasses relative motion is slower and with Plus glasses relative motion is faster. The motion sickness will go away with time as your brain adjusts itself to the difference.  Curiously, it is almost like your brain has the ability to "store" several different vision processing programs and "load" the appropriate one for the GOC combination you are wearing. </p><p>You might find that Motion Sickness pills help you deal with the nausea symptoms.  </p><p>Some years ago, I had Medial Rectus Muscle Recession surgery. They moved the attach point back on my eyeballs to try to fix an Esophoria problem. As I woke up from the anesthesia, the nurse reached for a trash can.  I asked why.  She commented that they tried to have a trash can or other container handy just in case the patient experienced severe nausea after some eye surgeries because of the vision differences.  Fortunately, I did not need it. </p><p>I wish you well with your GOC experiments. High Plus GOC seems to be worse than High Minus GOC for causing initial nausea.  If you go higher, you might consider having some Motion Sickness pills, handy. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JC</b>&nbsp;09 May 2017, 06:49</p><p>My actual prescription is about -4 with insignificant astigmatism in both eyes, and for years I have switched between that and a GOC combo with -9.5 glasses.  I decided to do something different and got a combination with +5 glasses to see what the farsighted world is like.  When I first wore them my initial impression was wow, everything is so huge.  It is easier to make out details both near and far -- far vision is like looking through binoculars and near is like looking through a magnifying glass.  The downsides are the field of vision is smaller, and when I move my head objects seems to jump around very quickly.  It took maybe an hour for me to adjust to this affect and for it to mostly go away, but even later in the day it still made my stomach a little unsettled. Walking on stairs I have to be careful because the stairs look so big to me I sometimes almost miss them when I put my foot down. When I took the contacts off and put my real glasses on things seemed to be moving around oddly again as I readjusted, but I have worn minus lenses for most of my life so this time the adjustment took a minute at most. </p><p> </p><p>What amazes me is that people outside of our community don't notice me going from -4 to -9 to +5, as long as the frame is the same. For me and for most everyone here this is a glaring difference. My wife knows I switch between -4 and -9 but still can't tell which is which.  I didn't tell her about the +5 to see if she sees a difference and so far she hasn't.  If she ever does, or more likely when I tell her, she'll shake her head and say "there you go again"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2017, 08:21</p><p>Werner, </p><p>Going from -6.00 to -20.00 is probably too much for you to tolerate very well.  Vision occurs in the brain.  Your eyes are merely biological cameras.  People who are naturally very Myopic and need -20 glasses had that happen gradually.  We typically suggest GOC increases of about -4.00 diopters maximum.  We also suggest that you DO NOT buy high minus glasses online with a prescription much different than yours and then try to find some contacts that make them work.  If you need Astigmatism correction that is different from what it in the glasses, it MAY NOT be possible to find Contact Lenses to make the glasses wearable and still function. </p><p>However, I suspect you are determined to try the -20 glasses.  I need your actual complete prescription for your glasses and the complete prescription in the -20 glasses to even begin the calculations or determine if they are even possible to wear comfortably.  I also need your age.  That will tell me how much your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses might be able to compensate for any inaccuracies. </p><p>Here are the basics to give you an idea of what is involved. </p><p>Vertex Distance (VD) (the distance from the front surface of your Cornea to the back surface of the glasses) is important with your -6.00 glasses and extremely important with -20.00 glasses because it is necessary to calculate the effective power of both glasses at the Cornea.  Actual VD is extremely hard to measure accurately.  It is typically 10 to 13 mm.  I use 12mm in my calculations.  The VD problem is that the effects are the Square (^2) of the Glasses Prescription.  With -6.00 glasses the VD effects are 0.036 diopters per mm.  That is why the perfect  Contact Lens prescription would be about 0.43 diopters less than your glasses prescription.  The perfect Contact Lens prescription for a person with 0.00 refractive error and -20 glasses would be about +15.00.  VD effects with -20 glasses are 0.40 diopters per mm.  Because you need -6 glasses, GOC Contact Lenses for -20 glasses would be considerably different.  A rough calculation indicates about +9.50 with a VD of 12 mm. </p><p>Please understand that even with the most accurate information, GOC is a very inexact "art".  The very best way to to High Prescription GOC is with the cooperation of a friendly Eye Care Professional.  With a refraction done with the Contact Lenses in place.  Even with that, the effective power of -20 glasses will vary by 0.40 diopters per mm of vertex distance. </p><p>You may be in for a very big surprise at the distortion in -20 glasses and the effects of the small image size on your Retinas.  Be VERY careful going down stairs or crossing curbs (cerbs?) you may not see them and may fall. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2017, 07:45</p><p>christopher, </p><p>Yes.  There are two kinds of Myopia that have the same effect.  Both can exist at the same time because they have two different causes.  If both are present, their effects are additive. </p><p>Axial or True Myopia is caused by a mismatch between the total PLUS power of your eye's lens system (somewhere around +59 diopters) and the length of your eyeball, specifically, the distance from your Crystalline Lens to your Retina (typically around 17 mm).  Unfortunately, at 28 it is very unlikely that your eyeballs can grow any more than they already have.  Your genes probably won't let that happen or if it does happen, it won't be very much (there are very rare exceptions). </p><p>Axial Myopia is considered "permanent" because once your eyeballs have grown to a certain size, like most body structures, they will not shrink. </p><p>The other type of Myopia is called Pseudo or False Myopia.  It is caused by your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses having trouble fully relaxing.  Your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses are the physically ACTIVE part of your Auto-Focus System.  Both are inside your eyes. </p><p>The Ciliary Muscles are extremely tiny muscles that squeeze your Crystalline Lenses to increase their PLUS power, so you can focus close.  For their size, the Ciliary Muscles are the strongest muscles in the body.   </p><p>The way the Auto-Focus system works is that the Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses are fully relaxed for distance vision.  When fully relaxed the Crystalline Lenses have about +19 diopters of focusing power (it varies with the individual), but when you focus on something closer (or wear vision correction with more MINUS than you actually need) your Ciliary Muscles squeeze your Crystalline Lenses and INCREASE their PLUS power to focus the images on your Retina.  Generally you are not even aware that you are doing it.  The amount of extra PLUS you need depends on the distance to the "target" or the amount of excess MINUS you are wearing.  The mathematical relationship between lens power and focus distance was discovered by Sir Isaac Newton (yes, that one) back around 1700. </p><p>At 28, it is very likely that you can Induce some Pseudo or False Myopia.  Pseudo Myopia is considered "temporary", but temporary can be a long time if you nurture it. </p><p>It is easy, to Induce Pseudo Myopia.  Believe it or not, you are already doing it a little bit.  If you spend 7 hours a day working with a computer.  It is likely that the distance from your eyes to the display is about 70 cm or 28 inches.  Using Sir Isaac's formula: Lens Power = 100 cm / Focus Distance, your Auto-Focus system is adding about +1.4 diopters of power to your Crystalline Lenses. </p><p>If you have ever noticed that distant objects or signs are NOT sharp and clear at the end of a day of working with your computer, You have actually Induced a bit of Pseudo Myopia.  All you have to do is encourage that by getting some Minus Glasses and wearing them full time.  You can start with low minus and increase it at whatever rate you can tolerate. </p><p>How high can you go, it depends primarily on your motivation and how far your Presbyopia has progressed.  Yes, you have Presbyopia and have probably had it since childhood.  Almost everyone has, but it has not become a nuisance yet and problem will not for 10 or 15 more years. </p><p>Here is a link to a Paper titled "The Eye" that you might find educational. </p><p> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180811031035/http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/scenario/labman3/eye.htm" target="_blank">http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/scenario/labman3/eye.htm</a> </p><p>I hope this has helped.  We can help you with either Inducing Myopia or GOC or both. </p><p>C,</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2017, 18:39</p><p>christopher, </p><p>Sorry I misunderstood.  That is a problem, but you may have to be a bit clever.  May I ask another question or two? </p><p>Do you live with any family members?  If you do, that makes it a bit harder, but you just have to be more careful and plant some seeds. </p><p>Do you have occasion to use a computer in your work?  If so, how much. </p><p>At 28, you should have plenty of accommodation </p><p>The first seed you need to plant is that you are having trouble reading small text at a distance, when watching TV or at the Cinema.  If you do any driving, reading small signs at nite after doing a lot of close work.  These are symptom of Myopia. </p><p>Comment that you think you should get an eye exam.  You don't actually have to do that. </p><p>Check out frame styles offered by Zenni Optical or other online retailers.  Find one you like that is not too expensive that you think you would like to wear for a long time. Once people are used to seeing you wearing glasses, you can make some lens changes without changing the frame and few people will notice the stronger lenses.  However, you will have trouble going too high for public wear, because that will be very noticeable.  However you can do GOC at your hearts content, away from your normal haunts.  The reason I suggest lower cost frames is that you may not wear the frames for very long, before you order another pair with stronger lenses. </p><p>Order a pair of low prescription glasses, say -1.00.  At 28 you should not have any problem wearing them, you are already doing GOC with 0.75 over correction.  Start wearing them and let everyone get used to your glasses.  GOCer's suggestion with your friends will work and family that you have not seen in a long time.  With close family, just say that you decided to get an eye exam and it turned out that you needed glasses.  You can either start wearing them full time (the best way) or wearing them intermittently when you drive, watch TV or go to the Cinema.  Another symptom that is useful when you want to increase your prescription is to have trouble reading menu boards or recognizing people, particularly in low light conditions. </p><p>You can slowly increase the prescription in the glasses, keeping the same frame and if you want to, begin to do low prescription GOC if you don't want to Induce any Myopia.  When you want to do an increase or change frames "develop" some of the symptoms described above. </p><p>I hope this helped a little.  One thing you need to remember is that we are all actors on a stage. You want to play the role of a glasses wearer.  You have to dress and act the part. </p><p>I am sure you have more questions after thinking about the above. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2017, 08:40</p><p>christopher, </p><p>-8 glasses are about -0.75 more that you probably need to match with +6 contacts, but at 28 that should not be a problem. </p><p>The biggest issue in going to a higher minus GOC combo is image minifcation.  It takes a while for your brain to learn to deal with all the issues.  If you are comfortable wearing the +6 / -8 combo for an extended period I would suggest going to -12 glasses and +10 contacts. </p><p>You should also consider an eye exam for contacts to find out what Base Curve is best for you and maybe your current actual refractive error.  Soft Contact are pretty forgiving, but you need to be sure that you have a good tear film between the contacts and your Cornea. </p><p>It will probably be a problem getting regular contacts because of your low prescription.  You may need to consider and exam for eye color changing contacts. </p><p>I have not considered your small refractive error in my GOC calculations. </p><p>By the way, GOC calculations are not difficult and at high Rx the results may be a bit different than the calculations indicate.  The differences occur because of Vertex Distance (VD) effects.   VD effects are the SQUARE of the Glasses Sphere divided by 1000.  If you get up to say -20, VD effects are 0.40 diopters per mm. </p><p>Actual VD, which is the distance in mm between your Cornea and the back surface of the glasses is very hard to measure or even estimate.  Typical VD is about 10 to 12 mm.  I typically use 12 mm in my calculations.  To give you an idea of how important VD is in GOC here are some examples of VD effects per mm. </p><p>-8.00 glasses = 0.06 diopters per mm </p><p>-12.00 glasses = 0.14 diopters per mm </p><p>-16.00 glasses = 0.25 diopters per mm </p><p>-20.00 glasses = 0.40 diopters per mm </p><p>To calculate the effective power of MINUS glasses at the Cornea, you multiply the VD effect per mm of the glasses by the VD and subtract it from the glasses  power.  For example -16.00 glasses 12 mm from the Cornea have an effective power of -16.00 glasses at the Cornea would be -13.00 and you would need +13.00 contacts if your refractive error was 0.00. </p><p>Hope this did not confuse you too much.  Let me know what you decide to do or if you need more help. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2017, 10:47</p><p>Leah </p><p>What your asking is very difficult to answer. Getting glasses is actually very easy to do and you don't need a prescription to order a pair, but just saying you want "strong glasses" makes it hard to suggest what prescription you should order. If you have perfect eyesight and your mainly just interested in wearing glasses that's fine. But you need to order glasses that your eyes will adjust to. Also going from no glasses to suddenly wearing strong glasses will get you lots of unwanted questions from your friends and co workers as well as family. You would be best to start off with very average glasses and as your eyes adjust slowly increase to stronger glasses. As for where to get your glasses I always recommend "zennioptical.com" but "eyebuydirect.com" is also very good and both have a nice large selection of glasses for under $13.00. Zenni actually  has a decent selection for under $7.00. For first glasses if you have perfect eyesight I would sya either order -.50 or -.75 for both eyes in the SPH section and leave everything else open. You don't want to fill anything in the CYL or axis areas. You might want to consider getting the optional AR coating which cuts down on glare and reflections and will make wearing glasses even easier for you. I also suggest thatg you answer Cactus Jack's questions because the things he is asking you are important as well. </p><p>Oh and you're in the GOC thread is that what you're really wanting to do? If so there is a lot more to it because of needing contacts as well. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2017, 08:47</p><p>Leah, </p><p>An "Official" prescription is one issued by an Eye Care Professional, typically after an examination. </p><p>Glasses are custom made.  The people who make glasses need a prescription to know how to make them.  Most online retailers of glasses do not require that you provide an "Official" prescription, but they need information from you as to the various elements that make up the prescription.   They are for each eye: </p><p>Sphere Power, Cylinder Power, Cylinder Axis, Prism Amount, Prism Base Direction, and Add plus special instructions such as the type of bifocal or trifocal. </p><p>The also need your Pupillary Distance, which is the distance in mm between the centers of your two pupils. </p><p>Not all prescriptions have all elements, but they are typically listed in the above order. </p><p>You can t just order "Strong Glasses".  The most important thing is that the glasses you order be wearable and comfortable.  Otherwise, they are a waste of money and can be very unpleasant to wear. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Leah</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2017, 06:36</p><p>What does that mean (it doesn't have to be an "official" one)? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2017, 23:11</p><p>Leah, </p><p>You can get them online with a "prescription", but it does not have to be an official one. </p><p>You should not attempt GOC without a plan and some coaching.  It is tempting to go to a high glasses prescription, but that generally does not work out very well.  Your brain has to learn to "see" with strong glasses and that can be somewhat traumatic, unless you approach it right. </p><p>If you want some help, you need to tell us more about yourself: </p><p>1. Do you presently wear vision correction? (Glasses or Contacts - which) </p><p>2. What is your prescription? </p><p>3. Where do you live. </p><p>4. What is your age and gender? </p><p>5.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2017, 16:48</p><p>juliette </p><p>I posted about this way back in 2013, but you might enjoy hearing about it. It really started back in 2012. I used to visit my sister that was living in a different city. Whenever I visited her I also visited the local shopping mall. In the mall there was an optical store. I would usually plan my visits so i could visit on the days when they didn't have a doctor. That meant there was only one optician working and she usually wasn't busy at all. In 2012 they hired a new optician. Very cute young lady and she was hired because she was about to enter optometry school to be an optometrist. Anyway she very nice and very friendly and we talked quite a bit. I noticed that she wasn't wearing glasses and I asked her if she wore glasses and she said her eyesight was perfect. She told me that her dad was a dentist and her older sister was a pharmacist and that they both wear glasses full time, but her eyesight was perfect. She told me that when she decided that she wanted to be an optometrist she knew nothing about glasses but was very curious to know. While her sister was away at college she even went in her room and found several pairs of her old glasses and tried to wear them just to see what it was like to wear glasses. But even the weakest ones she could only wear for very short time before she felt a headache coming on and she had to take them off. That caused me to remember what I had read in this thread about GOC. I work with a non profit vision group and because of that I happened to have a good number of sample glasses that I keep in my car that I use to fit people with glasses that can't afford them. At the time I knew i had a very nice pair with just a -1.25 prescription in them. I told her to go and pull out a pair of trial contact lenses in +1.25 and that I would be right back in. When I came back in she was sitting at a table and she had 2 contact lens packets in her hands. She thought that I wanted them for myself so she was really shocked when I asked her to put them on. She got them both on rather quickly and I as soon s she looked away from the mirror in front of her I could see that she wasn't able to focus. She was smiling and squinting as she was trying hard to see things away from her. I asked her if she was able to read a sign across the room from where we were sitting and she could only make out the bigger letters and she said they were even blurry. I took the glasses out and said "here let's see if these help you" as i put the glasses on her. As soon as I did that she couldn't believe that now she was once again able to see everything perfectly. As you can imagine she was then doing a lot of her own testing of her eyes with and without glasses. But the whole time she had the biggest smile on her face. After several minutes of both looking through the glasses and over the top of them she finally pushed the glasses up in place and said she loved it. She said several times how cool it was to be wearing glasses. We continued talking and she never did take the glasses off she was totally enjoying wearing glasses. After a while a customer came in and needed the nose pads on his glasses replaced. This was going ot be a nice test for for her trying to replace nose pads that have very tiny screws wearing glasses for the first time. I watched her to see if she was going to have any problem and I did notice her move her head a bit as if she was having trouble focusing. But after a few minuted she had both nose pads replaced and he thanked her and left. When she came i asked her if she had any problem doing that and she said that when she first looked down her eyes were seeing the bottom of the glasses so she had to adjust for that. I didn't plan on leaving my sample glasses with her but she was having so much fun so i asked her if she wanted to borrow them until my next visit and she jumped at the chance to wear the glasses more. As it turned out I didn't get back until a month later. She told me that the doctor and her co workers were shocked to see her come into work wearing glasses. She told them about me loaning her the glasses and how she was wearing the opposite contacts to make it work. The doctor was very interested and had never heard of such a thing as GOC and she insisted on testing her eyes with and with her wearing GOC just to be sure that she wasn't doing any harm to her eyes but she proved that with the contacts and glasses her eyesight was perfect as well as without the contacts and glasses. The doctor even said that she was going to have to remember  that because she was going to try it for herself. I still keep in touch with her last year she graduated and she is now officially a doctor of optometry. She decided to move out of state for some reason but she told me not long ago that she still enjoys doing GOC just for fun and has shown a good number of people as well.  </p><p>The other one was a young lady working at a big box store that has an optical center. She also didn't need glasses. In box stores like that they often hire you for one thing and then put you in something else. That was the case here. She had no experience with vision or glasses at all. But once she got trained she really enjoyed her kob. One day when I was in there shopping I stopped and chatted with her a bit. She was at the frame board trying on frames. As soon as she saw me she wanted my opinion as to which ones looked best on her. After a bit i decided on the one I thought looked best and she said that was her 2nd choice but was happy I picked it. She told me that her year was nearly up and that meant she could get a free pair of glasses. I asked her if she needed glasses and she said she wasn't sure but even if she didn't she still wanted a pair of glasses just to wear for fun and at the store as well. She was getting her eyes checked later that week. The next tie I was at her store i saw her working but she wasn't wearing glasses. I asked her if she had gotten her glasses yet and she told me she wasn't very happy. She said that her eyesight was perfect so she didn't really need glasses. But when she went order her glasses she was told that because she didn't have an actual prescription she couldn't get a free pair. Bingo! Remembering how I helped my other friend with perfect vision I still had the very same -1.25 glasses so I told her how she could get glasse sif she wanted and I let her borrow my sample pair to try away from works so she could see that it wouldn't dod any harm to her eyes. She was able to get the glasses she wanted that way and she couldn't stop thanking me. </p><p>Sorry for the long post. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2017, 15:01</p><p>juliette </p><p>I'm really glad that you're enjoying doing GOC so much. Actually you were a perfect candidate for doing GOC because you were already an experienced contact lens wearer as well as glasses wearer and you clearly like how your husband's glasses look. So with Cactus Jack's help in prescribing you a perfect combination for both contacts and glasses you seem to be enjoying perfect clarity now after a normal adjusting period. One thing you didn't mention which I have a feeling you also enjoy is seeing how much more blurry everything is when you take off your -9.00 glasses compared to your own glasses? It's possible that your eyes might be very slightly over corrected but that's not a bad thing because it's worse to be under corrected. The lenses in your glasses are most likely CR-39 which is what they consider regular lenses, so with -9.00 prescription lenses i'm sure they look nice and thick. I'm not surprised that you are planning if not already making GOC your everyday look now and not just something fun to do on the weekend.  </p><p>So it seems that your friend is wanting to as you say "join the GOC" club now. It helps that she already wears glasses. Does she wear her glasses full time or part time? And I have a feeling since her prescription isn't very strong I doubt that she has ever wore contacts? So for her the first step she need to do is make an appointment to get contacts. Probably not a bad idea depending when she got her current glasses. When she goes she should be sure to get a copy of her glasses prescription as well as the contact prescription and fitting. The fitting is the main thing and tell her not to bother ordering any contacts in her real prescription unless she really wants contacts in her actual prescription. Once she has the base curve and diameter for her contacts she will be ready to start looking for the glasses she wants to wear and you can help her order the correct contacts to go along with her glasses. Is she wanting her glasses to be  as strong as yours?  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>juliette</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2017, 02:57</p><p>Hello Soundman </p><p>Your posting really confirms what I feel with these new glasses, I feel much more self assured, self confidence, &amp; more over feel I look much more sophisticated with this GOC combination. But besides this the clarity of my vision is amazing, &amp; I really couldn't imagine it could be so good doing GOC as its called. As you said the lenses I assume are CR 30 something, low index, &amp; have flat fronts &amp; on the outer edges they must be around 10mm thick, &amp; look stunning. </p><p>It was a typing error on the power, &amp; I did use 10.50 Biofinity XR for the exercise. The first couple of days I felt a little bit dizzy but that's gone. The whole experience is great, &amp; I intend doing it daily, &amp; hope I can work up to -12.00/-14.00. </p><p>Yes my friend does wear glasses, I think her prescription is around -1.5, but she intends to join the 'Club' as someone said. </p><p>Thanks to everyone for support &amp; advice..its great  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2017, 13:01</p><p>Brit, </p><p>Here are the calculations assuming a Vertex Distance of 12 mm. </p><p>20^2 = 400 /1000 = 0.4 diopters per mm x 12 mm = 4.8 </p><p>OOPS!.  </p><p>I made a mistake. I should have added the 4.8 to the +20 for PLUS glasses VD effect.  I do so many calculations for MINUS glasses that I inadvertently subtracted.  The CLs for +20 glasses should be -25.00.  Theoretically, it should be about -24.8 assuming a VD of 12 mm.  The VD is a SWAG and with +/-20 glasses it is a major factor.  If a person is not too old, I suggest a little more MINUS or a little less PLUS that I think you will need because your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses should be able to add a little PLUS to compensate. </p><p>Thanks for calling this to my attention.  </p><p>plusglasslov, </p><p>Please note the change in the suggested GOC combination.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2017, 10:57</p><p>plusglasslov, </p><p>To answer your specific question, you need approximately -15 contact lenses to go with +20 glasses, assuming you have perfect uncorrected vision and have enough accommodation range to compensate slightly for any errors.  If you don't know why there is a difference between the power of the Glasses and the Contact Lenses, you probably need some serious coaching. </p><p>If you want to do successful GOC we need to start with answers to these questions: </p><p>1. How old are you? </p><p>2. Where do you live? </p><p>3. What is your latest glasses prescription? </p><p>4. Have you ever worn Contact Lenses? </p><p>You need to approach high prescription GOC slowly, carefully and with planning. </p><p>Based on the answers to the above questions, there will probably be more questions. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2017, 10:51</p><p>Hasan </p><p>Okay now I get what you did and why. So she avoided even wearing her own prescription glasses because her eyes appear slightly smaller under her glasses. And her prescription is only a -1.50 which to most people would hardly be noticeable. So you first needed to get her started wearing glasses and you  were able to convince her by getting her emerald green minus colored contacts which she must have liked because they enhanced the color of her eyes and then had her pick out glasses that suited her with plus lenses to match up with her contacts. And of course she likes seeing her nice big green eyes so she has been more than willing to wear her glasses and has found out that doing GOC hasn't done any harm to her eyes. But your real goal is to get her wearing stronger minus glasses for GOC. But for whatever reason finding plus colored contacts is much harder to find in plus than minus prescriptions. So that is one problem. But even if you do find them I think your wife would be disappointed as soon as she put on the -5.00 glasses over her eyes. The green contacts would hardly be noticeable to her under her glasses. There would be a huge difference for her seeing her eyes wearing +4.00 glasses and then seeing her eyes wearing -5.00 glasses. Maybe have her pick out glasses if she already hasn't that she likes and just find clear +3.50 contacts to see if it is worth looking any harder for the green color. As you know the glasses won't be very expensive and if you can order just one box of lenses they shouldn't be much either. And maybe she won't be happy at first but if she likes the glasses enough she might decide to give it a try after a while. Other wise you still have the option of seeing her wearing the combination she has now and she seems to enjoy wearing. Also if she wears the GOC often enough she will find that she needs to wear her own prescription glasses when she isn't doing GOC.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hasan</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2017, 05:03</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p>Plus glasses was the first step in my plan. The only way not to make her eyes look smaller with glasses was GOC. We`ve made it using emerald green colour lences - big green eyes was necessary requirement. Now when she had understood that there is nothing harmful in GOC and she got used to it with "her" combination", I`m gonna convince her to try "my" combination with minus glasses. The only problem - I didn`t found colour plus lences yet.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2017, 10:38</p><p>Hasan </p><p>Sorry about that. It's just that it is a bit unusual for someone already a bit nearsighted to want to want plus glasses. But it makes sense if she didn't want her eyes to look smaller under her glasses. But now it seems that she is going to try wearing minus glasses if she is wanting to get +3.50 lenses and -5.00 glasses. Is she now okay with her eyes appearing slightly smaller under her glasses? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2017, 10:28</p><p>juliette </p><p>Since your husband wears -14.00 glasses i'm not at all surprised that he is loves seeing you wearing glasses nearly as strong as his glasses and of course supports you fully. I'm sure that your glasses look really nice in that frame you chose as well as your nice thick lenses. So i'm sure you must really enjoy wearing them every chance you get. It's always interesting how wearing glasses effects some women. Certainly for many wearing glasses seems to change their whole additude and they way thye see themselves. And for some like yourself it is more like an empowerment and provides you even more self confidence. I can only assume it's because you have wanted stronger glasses for so long and now that you have them you feel like you could conquer the world. Did you go with the combination that Cactus Jack suggested to you? I did notice that he was suggesting you order +10.50 SPH only contacts to go with -9.00 glasses but then you asking where you might be able to order +10.25 contacts? Not that much difference if that is what you actually ordered. Where were you able to get your contacts from? It has gotten more difficult recently to order contacts without a doctor's approval. Your friend seemed impressed enough at your glasses that after trying your glasses is wanting to try it herself. Of course i'm sure you would help her in getting a combination that will work for her. Does she currently wear glasses or would this be her first time wearing glasses? If so she probably needs to start off much weaker.   </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hasan</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2017, 03:14</p><p>Soundmanpt, I`m really excited, but there is no mistake - now she wears -4.0 lences with +2.5 glasses. All this story started long time ago. My wife always was little bit nearsighted and even she had glasses, she never used them. Sometimes I succeded to convince her to put them on for me but she always said that she don`t like her eyes look smaller in glasses. GOC become a good idea in this situation. Plus glasses makes her eyes look bigger and we both like that.  </p><p></p><hr>

You said that she is now wearing -4.00 lenses with +2.50 glasses. I think what you meant to say was that she is wearing +2.50 lenses with -4.00 glasses? It's clear that you appreciate her looks wearing stronger glasses and I would assume since she didn't go overly strong her eyesight should be very good with her -4.00 glasses and +2.50 contacts. The one thing she need to be careful with is changing from one glasses frame to a different frame in a short time could lead to extra unwanted questions about her glasses, not the lenses. so if she is considering going stronger anytime soon she should try and order the exact same frame as her -4.00 glasses.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hasan</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2017, 04:16</p><p>Finally it happaned! My wife started wearing GOC. Her real prescribtion is -1.5 on both eyes. She sometimes wears -4 lences and +2.5 glasses. In this glasses she looks really great! Now we are thinking about combination of +3.5 lences and -5 glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2017, 02:36</p><p>Juliette </p><p> </p><p>Welcome to the club! I'm glad GOC is working good for you. </p><p>I myself started GOC'ing around june last year, and after a few dizzing problems in the beginning, I've adapted really well. I started with -9 glasses and have now worked my way up to -20. So I'm sure you too will adapt well to stronger lenses soon. </p><p> </p><p>Tell us more about your experience. How's the feeling of seeing youself in those thick lenses? What sort of frames did you choose? And how is your husband reacting to it? Does he like it? Has anybody aside your husband seen you and noticed something different? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>juliette</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2017, 02:01</p><p>In the later part of last year, I came across this site, &amp; the section 'Glasses over contacts'. As I explained, I didn't know at the time this  was possible. With the feedback I received, it was a chance for me to get stronger, thicker more powerful glasses that I had wanted for a long time. I have now been doing GOC for around 6 weeks. The first few days it felt a little strange, but with perseverance, I can now  wear the combination all day with comfort..it really works well. I now feel &amp; look as though I need glasses, &amp; I feel great in them. I intend to persist with them which at present is not a problem, &amp; before the holidays try to increase to somewhat stronger lenses if possible. It is really a nice experience &amp; I can now fully understand those who like &amp; want these stronger thicker glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NNVisitor</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2017, 22:13</p><p>Diana </p><p> </p><p>You are best off just wearing your own prescription. I've had really bad eyesight and wore strong glasses. If people took notice of that fact they rarely showed it. I wore thick glasses before there was the thin option. I hated wearing them and was selfconsious. I did get some comments about them and my eyesight but not very often. I did get contact lenses which I've mostly worn for many years. </p><p>The reality is that many people wear glasses and that some people wear strong glasses. As most people are concerned about their own problems it's really no big deal if they see others wearing strong glasses. I doubt that if you wore -4 or -6.50 that people would take special notice. So why go through all the effort? You are best off wearing the prescription you need.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2017, 03:44</p><p>You could also try Firmoo- they do regular 1.5 index lenses which are the thickest option available to you, I don't know how they compare on price though but they often have offers available especially for new customers </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2017, 11:11</p><p>Diana </p><p>Okay now that you have made it clear what your wanting for glasses that is a big help. So if you want the cheapest and thickest lenses possible I think you want Zenni. You will find a good number of glasses for $6.95 and that is including prescription lenses. It will ask you "Prescription type" and where it says "Select" you will be given a choice of single vision, bifocal, progressive, non-prescription, and frame only. Of course you want to click on "Single Vision" Then if you want -4.00 glasses you simply click on the -4.00 in the SPH column for both eyes and the next step it will show you various lens options. The first being 1.50 which they call a standard single vision lens and is no additional charge. Then you see a 1.57 lens which they call mid index single vision and it si also no additional charge and then there are other lenses as well. Zenni is suggesting for best looks and thing lenses that you get the 1.61 high index lens which is an additional charge. But you don't have to got that and you simply click on the first option of 1.50 and that should be a rather thick lens. The reason they offer both a 1.50 and 1.57 lens is because for someone getting glasses with just a a -.50 prescription a rimless frame would be extremely thin if they only offered the 1.57 lens. So I don't think you are going to find any glasses cheaper than $6.95 and shipping is only $5.00. So that adds up to $12.00.  </p><p>But once again I am reminding you that to do this right and so you're happy once you get your glasses and contacts you really do need to get your exact current prescription. I'm sure Cactus Jack will agree with me and he will also tell you that you need to get a fitting done for contacts. By the way it has gotten much more difficult buying contacts anymore without a real prescription. Have you done any research on getting the contacts you're going to need? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2017, 10:27</p><p>Diana, </p><p>Check out Optical4less.  I don't know their current policy, but they used to have a special makings department.  They would make glasses of any reasonable thickness with almost any prescription.  They are not cheap, but their quality is excellent. </p><p>Also, check out what Zenni will do.  They may suggest a thinner lens, but you may be able to select a lower index lens material. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Diana</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2017, 10:04</p><p>I want the thickest, cheapest glasses possible. Preferably without losing my natural vision.  </p><p> </p><p>I was planning on purchasing a -6.75 prescription from Swift Eyewear but they forced me to pay for thin lenses. I don't want to do that. That's why I decided to get the -4s with a 1.49 index lens. I was hoping that they'd still be very thick because I want to look like I'm wearing cokebottles.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2017, 02:20</p><p>Amy, -4 won't be anywhere near coke bottle status, but an easy way / general rule I've found is that for ever dioptre, i.e. every -1, the lenses will be about 1mm thick. The bigger the frame the thicker the lenses at the outside edge, but generally you won't be looking at anymore than a maximum I would've thought of about 3mm thick at the edge. </p><p> </p><p>The following website is a good way of working out how thick lenses will be, but it can vary slightly. As you will see, you will need to know the measurements of the frame to work this out and your pupillary distance which if you don't have it / haven't had it measured is on average between 60 and 62mm. </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180811031035/http://64.50.176.246/tools/thickness.php" target="_blank">http://64.50.176.246/tools/thickness.php</a> </p><p> </p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2017, 15:28</p><p>Diana </p><p>What exactly are you wanting to wear stronger glasses for? My first thought was that you just want your glasses to look more necessary than they are. So if anything you would be happier if your lenses did look thick and strong. But you actually would be happier to wear even stronger glasses as long as the lenses aren't too thick. And you don't seem to want to cause your own natural eyesight to get any worse but want people to think your eyesight is poor.  </p><p>Where are you planning on getting your glasses from and what style of glasses do you plan on getting? Many in here use Zenni (zennioptical.com) for their glasses to induce myopia with or for doing GOC. They do offer two lens thicknesses at no additional cost 1.50 and 1.57 the 1.57 is a slightly thinner lens which is what you're asking about. They do offer several options for hi index lenses as well they are 1.61 for an additional $19.00 and a 1.67 which is a $34.00 option.  </p><p>So how did you come up with your SPH equivalent being -2.50? It almost sounds like you did some type of on line vision test? So if that is accurate then the contacts would be +1.50. That isn't all that much more to get to -4.00. Have you given any thought to just buying -4.00 glasses or even maybe -3.50 glasses and wearing them without the contacts? Your eyes should be able to tolerate wearing -3.50 glasses pretty well   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Diana</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2017, 14:22</p><p>Found out that my spherical equivalent is actually -2.50  </p><p> </p><p>Wanted to go higher than -4.00 but don't want to have to pay for the thin lenses. They don't give you the option of buying higher prescriptions in CR39. Would -4 in CR39 be cokebottles?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2017, 11:28</p><p>Diana </p><p>In order to provide you with an accurate answer for the contact lens power that you would need to go along with -4.00 glasses you really need to be exact with what your current glasses are. Based on your glasses being between -1.75 and -2.25 it could be any of these. </p><p> </p><p>If your glasses are -1.75 then you would need +2.25 contacts  </p><p>if your glasses are -2.00 then you would need +2.00 contacts </p><p>if your glasses are -2.25 then you would need +1.75 contacts </p><p> </p><p>Now if you decide to guess that your glasses are -1.75 and order +2.25 contacts and your glasses are actually -2.25 then your eyes are going to be over corrected wearing the -4.00 glasses. Not the worst thing that could happen because your eyes would probably adjust okay to wearing the stronger over all prescription. But it could be a bigger problem for you if your glasses are -2.25 and you order the +1.75 contacts and then find out that your glasses are only -1.75. Now wearing your -4.00 glasses your eyes would be under corrected and that would mean that your distance vision would be somewhat blurry and you probably couldn't wear your -4.00 glasses for driving. So I really recommend that you first find out what prescription you're currently wearing before buying anything. If you have had your eyes checked in the past 12 months or so then if you go back to where you either had your eyes examined or where you got your current glasses from they will gladly provie you with a copy of your prescription. If it has been much longer since you had your eyes examined then you probably need to get your eyes examined anyway because it's possible your eyes have changed a bit since your last exam. Its even possible that you might have a small astigmatism and don't know it. All this information will make it very easy to then suggest what you need for contacts so you can wear -4.00 glasses in comfort and be able to see perfectly as well. I have feeling since your not trying to go to extremes you are only wanting your glasses to look more necessary and plan on wearing them quite often once you get the right combination of glasses and contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2017, 09:50</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p>Absolutely!  Good point.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2017, 09:38</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p>Shouldn't she get her cylinder put into her glasses rather than deal with the more expensive and less comfortable toric lenses? I also agree with both of you that at least for her first attempt at GOC going with -3.00 glasses would not only look very nice for her glasses but probably easier for her to adjust to for frequent wearing. I assume she is considering making these her everyday glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2017, 07:55</p><p>til, </p><p>That sounds about right for GOC contacts and -3 glasses.  If the glasses are less than - 4 to - 4.5, they will have almost no Vertex Distance effects.  You can just algebraically add the GOC CL prescription to their GOC glasses prescription.  Just remember that corrective lens prescriptions are the reverse of the actual refractive error. </p><p>The nice thing about a good GOC combo is that little or no accommodative effort is needed, If she goes for a GOC combo with glasses above -4.50 in Sphere, you will need to consider VD effects of the glasses.  Just remember that VD INCREASES the effective power of MINUS glasses at the Cornea so you need LESS power in the contacts and DECREASES at the effective power of PLUS glasses at the Cornea so you need MORE power in the contacts.   </p><p>Sounds confusing?  Yes it is, and that is why those of us who understand it make the BIG MONEY and/or get nice Birthday presents.  Enjoy! </p><p>Toric contacts are notoriously hard to get right so they don't rotate on the Cornea and make Astigmatism effects worse than not having any Cylinder correction. </p><p>C</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2017, 12:03</p><p>Sparky, </p><p>I suggest getting some +12.00 Contact Lenses.

You might want to consider ordering some very low cost, single vision glasses, from an online retailer such as Zenni, with NO options,  If your distance vision with this combo is satisfactory, then order some bifocals or progressives with the frames and options you desire.

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2017, 12:21</p><p>gwgs, </p><p> </p><p>this is alarming news indeed. It makes me wonder if my latest order from Zenni (Jan. 11th) will arrive in time for the purpose I had in mind. They always send a message within a couple of days that the glasses are ready and sent on the post. So far, no such message. I live in the Netherlands and perhaps they start to apply the same policy on my country as well. It would be a blow to my photography  project if the supply would come to a halt.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2017, 11:34</p><p>gwgs </p><p>Wow!  That's interesting to say the least. If there doing that in the UK I fear the same thing may soon stat happening here in the US. You no doubt have heard Mr. Trump saying he plans on taxing things such as cars coming in from Japan. I never considered that he may also go after all the on line sites as well for buying glasses. But one thing might stop him. There really isn't any frame companies based in the US. I know for a fact that nearly every frame is now being made is Japan anyway. Only a very few come in from Italy. Luxottica I believe is based in Austria and they own and supply Lenscrafters, Pearle Vision, J.C. Penny Optical, Sears Optical, Target Optical and even Sunglass hut with all their frames and even own many of the designer companies such as Ray-Ban and Oakley. So it would seem they couldn't very well charge a tax on sites like "eyebuydirect" or "Zenni" because of this. That leads me to question if therre are any frame companies based in the UK? If there isn't it would seem they are wrong in trying to charge a tariv or tax on the cheaper on line sites for the reason I stated. In other in fairness if the frames glasses and frames being sold in the high end stores are coming in from other places how are they being allowed into the UK? They have no right to protect the high price shops unless the frames and glasses are being COMPLETELY made in the UK.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2017, 02:25</p><p>This should probably go in the Glasses for Auction or Sale thread, but I thought it was as equally, if not more relevant here. </p><p> </p><p>Yesterday I went to great lengths to go and collect my first order from Firmoo from a couriers depot. I'd ordered a pair of -15's in a fairly big frame (52mm) that I had been told would be produced with myodisc lenses - just what I wanted. </p><p> </p><p>I was out when the courier tried to deliver and when I contacted them, they wanted a further delivery fee for attempting redelivery so I agreed to meet them at their depot instead and it was well worth it as it was a tiny little out of the way office that they had and were subcontracted by a firm that deals with the majority of Zenni and Firmoo orders coming into the UK. Their depot/office was just moments away from Heathrow airport. </p><p> </p><p>When I got into their office, he asked me for id and said he had to take copies of this as customs was clamping down on international orders like these as they had realised how much money the UK industry, and customs were losing in people ordering glasses from the Far East! I said I was amazed at this, and he said, "just look over there", under a desk to his right were probably 3ft high by 2ft wide of packages all of a similar size and shape to mine! He said, "I'm presuming they're all glasses, similar to what you've got...but they're the lucky ones.". I asked why and he said "today Customs have stopped every single plane (cargo planes I presume) coming in from Hong Kong, China, Singapore, everything from the Far East they've offloaded all the cargo from the plane and confiscated it as they're sick and tired of people paying £10 for something that would be £120 on the high street, or not paying tax/duty upon it coming into the country."  </p><p> </p><p>He continued. "They've been doing the same with custom made suits, every single one they find that's coming into the country on these cargo consignments, they're slashing the arms off the suits and repackaging them and releasing them onto their recipient, as they're only meant to be samples but people are saving so much from buying them online. I can see the same thing happening with these glasses." </p><p> </p><p>I was astonished that Customs would be interested in this, but he said they've got their fingers into every little thing and don't miss a trick. Watch this space?!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2017, 09:32</p><p>gwgs, I don't think most people notice thick glasses unless it is apparent that the person really has trouble seeing. A high myope with only a refractive error can actually function perfectly well, so probably to most people they don't seem impaired. High hyperopes struggle a lot more for the same absolute prescription strength, mostly due to the lack of peripheral vision, and I think it is evident. Although no one makes comments, I do notice that cashiers often take special care to place the change in my hands in ways that they don't when I'm not wearing my thick glasses. It's by no means all the time, but several times a week.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2017, 07:55</p><p>Interesting observations NJ, I have tended to wear mine is what people would refer to as "working class" areas, so not at all wealthy, but nevertheless, no comments. </p><p> </p><p>As you say, I think the fact that myodiscs are SO rare that people may perceive them to be a disability, and not related to high myopia, and this maybe why they haven't been stares, glances or conversation makers / breakers as people are lot more aware now than they used to be of being politically correct and don't want to step over the line.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2017, 13:53</p><p>I'll make one other observation about people who notice and make comments about thick glasses. It's inversely proportional to economic status. When I wear my thick glasses in poor neighborhoods, I hear lots of comments, in wealthy neighborhoods, not so much. Not sure why this is true, but I've noticed it for as long as I've worn thick glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2017, 13:33</p><p>@gwgs, I started doing GOG in college back in the early 80's and I have made a number of observations on how much others notice, or at least make it obvious they notice, thick glasses. For calibration purposes, I'll say that most of my GOC work was with high plus, +15 to +20, but I've done even higher on both the plus and minus sides on occasion.  </p><p> </p><p>My first observation is that the older I get, the less people seem to notice the glasses. When I was young I constantly heard comments and saw people staring at them. When I moved to a new town for grad school and did GOC as often as not, essentially adopting the identity of an extreme hyperope, there was a fellow grad student, but different department, who constantly made comments on the size of my eyes, how I had to look through them in a certain way to see anything, how I used the bifocal part, etc. She never ceased to find them humorous. Too bad I didn't really find her that attractive, despite her low minus glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>On the other side of the spectrum, there used to be a cheap chain optical store in the area. I walked in there one day wearing +20D lenses and asked for new glasses. The sales lady showed me a number of pairs, from which I chose my favorite. When she was starting to write up the order she saw my script and told me they didn't make plus glasses higher than +8. Despite being a professional, she didn't even notice how strong my glasses were.  </p><p> </p><p>As glasses have become more common and people more sensitive to those with disabilities, I think it's just far less common for people to take any obvious notice of thick glasses. I still occasionally get asked about my glasses, but usually by people I've known for a while. I can't remember the last time a stranger made a comment or even gave me an unusual look or stare. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2017, 03:09</p><p>I haven't posted on here for a while as I'm more of a reader of this section now in picking up tips but having GOC'd quite seriously now for several months I thought I'd post my weekends experience here; </p><p> </p><p>I GOC'd with my selection of myodiscs (I have 6 pairs, but perdominantly wore 3 different pairs over the weekend) for pretty much the entire weekend, I was left feeling disappointed by the weaker glasses (if you can call them that, as in everyday life, an optician would call you partially sighted if you needed them!!) after I watched some football on Sunday afternoon with a friend, I obviously didn't GOC with him around, but after he had gone, I decided to pay some attention to -9.75 / -10 glasses I have in my collection and what I found interesting was when I was cooking, I couldn't make out the small print / cooking instructions on the packaging whilst wearing them and had to resort to having a pair of bifocals in this prescription handy in order to read, yet I didn't have any trouble with close up work wearing the myodiscs, two of which are -20.5, and -21.5. Whether this was reading the newspaper, browsing various things on my phone, reading the tv guide and descriptions of programmes etc, my vision was remarkably crystal clear! </p><p> </p><p>I decided to be brave and wore the -21.5 myodiscs out for my first extended time ever - I've worn them out for a walk up and down the road late at night, but never during daytime for shopping etc so left home bright and early. </p><p> </p><p>I drove to a shopping centre a little distance away and put in my contacts in the carpark and then did my supermarket / household shopping, taking a break in the shop's cafe for some late breakfast but was amazed at the lack of looks and response! Before when I've worn the -10's and -13.75's I've had a few glances that you can guess are people checking out the unusually strong lenses, but with these -21.5 myodiscs I didn't get a single look. I took a couple of selfies - which I never normally do - and to my surprise I looked remarkably good in them and they blended in very well with my outfit. </p><p> </p><p>When it came to time to pay, I deliberately picked a checkout where there was a female clerk wearing glasses. There was only one of these, despite there being a number of tills so I had to wait. </p><p>She was Afro Carribean, probably 40-45 years old, her glasses were very weak, but I was hoping as a fellow glasses wearer they might be some intrigue and provoke a little conversation.  </p><p>In the queue I thought this had worked as she looked over in my direction several times whilst scanning through the other customers items. </p><p>When it got to my turn she smiled at me and asked how I was doing, I greeted her in a friendly manner also and asked how her days was going. She seemed for a moment to be like a rabbit in headlights when I made direct eye contact with her, this probably lasted for about 4-5 seconds, and I'm guessing it was her not knowing what to think or my glasses and maybe it was me reading what I wanted into it, but I think she probably wanted to comment on or ask about my glasses, but didn't have the courage to do so. Sensing this, I responded by saying I liked her choice of eyewear - truth is, they couldn't have been more bland! black hexi frames with a couple of + dioptres, hardly setting the world alight. </p><p> </p><p>Anyhow, despite me trying to make conversation with her, she seemed in her own world and I paid and that was that. I continued to wear these frames for the majority of the day whilst visiting a couple of other shops, being confronted by a couple of direct marketing girls on the street who I engaged in conversation with and then went back to the carpark, and went  home (taking the contacts out). I wore these </p><p> </p><p>It certainly made me think that I will be GOC'ing with the myodiscs more often than not now!</p><p></p><hr>

I found one who is willing to perform the procedure at Eagle Eye Centre in Singapore (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180811031035/http://www.eagleeyecentre.com.sg/)." target="_blank">http://www.eagleeyecentre.com.sg/).</a>  I'm fortunate in that English is one of their official languages.  They no longer post their fees on the website but, at the time that I inquired, I think it was either $3200 or $3600 per eye to have this done. </p><p> </p><p>I'm not planning to have the procedure done for another 8 years.  I'm waiting for the new Visian ICL with CentraFLOW to be approved for market over there.  The CentraFLOW feature allows for aqueous flow through the lens.  Because of this, it's no longer necessary to get a peripheral iridotomy (burning a small hole in your iris to permit aqueous flow). </p><p> </p><p>I know it may seem like a long time but, if life has taught me anything, it's that time will absolutely fly.  Those 8 years will fly by in no time. </p><p> </p><p>Chino</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2016, 08:43</p><p>Chino, </p><p>You sound a good candidate for refractive surgery. From my experience,just keep a few things in mind. </p><p>If you are still working chose an Rx which will give you useable vision. I cannot read print now, I can read news headlines but not much else. I manage with the computer as zoom is a godsend.  </p><p>Take someone with you when you have the surgery. I was alone and felt low and lonely for the five weeks as I waited for my new glasses. I stayed in a family run hotel in Mumbai who looked after me very well and even escorted me when I ventured outside. </p><p>Have one eye done at a time. One mistake I made was to agree to having both eyes together. Thankfully there were no complications but there could have been. Also with one eye at a time you have good vision from the other eye.  </p><p>Think final Rx. I was already doing GOC with very high 30s and simply wanted more and more. My present Rx does handicap me at times.  </p><p>The Iris IOL is visible I am told but not by me. Without glasses I cannot see a thing, literally. With glasses my eyes look so small that nothing can be seen. The optician I use asked about the IOL and accepted my excuse.  </p><p>I don't regret the surgery. At times I get frustrated but never want to reverse it. The kick you will get from it is fantastic, very exciting. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2016, 16:24</p><p>Hi David, </p><p> </p><p>I'm 35, and still working.  I'm in the USA, living in Florida at the moment.  I have considered doing what you've done for quite a few years. </p><p> </p><p>My immediate goal is to have a prescription in the -40s.  Given your visual acuity in the -54 glasses, I'm not sure I would be able to get my driver license here in Florida.  I may need to move out of state. </p><p> </p><p>A number of other states, including Georgia, allow people to drive with visual acuity as low as 20/200, as long as they wear bioptic systems that allow them to see at least 20/60 or 20/40.  I found a wealth of information on the subject at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180811031035/http://www.biopticdrivingusa.com/" target="_blank">http://www.biopticdrivingusa.com/</a> </p><p> </p><p>Florida is odd in that bioptics are allowed for driving, but not to pass the vision screening.  I suppose I could wear contacts for the vision screening, and use a bioptic system when I'm actually driving. </p><p> </p><p>The public transportation system in my area of Florida is absolute rubbish.  The ability to drive is a bit of a necessity over here. </p><p> </p><p>My current Rx is -5.00 D in both eyes, with -0.25 D in each eye, at different angles.  I actually induced my myopia.  I remember being curious about glasses when I was probably 6 or 7 years old.  I liked them, and wanted to need them.  I didn't understand why someone would need to wear glasses...what blurry vision looked like. </p><p> </p><p>I was fascinated by nearsightedness.  When I was about 12 or 13 years old, I started reading up as much as I could about the subject.  I learned about the habits that supposedly led to the development of myopia.  I then implemented those habits. </p><p> </p><p>I found a pair of my grandfather's glasses (minus lenses), and wore those when no one was around.  I would watch TV and read with my eyes as close to the material as I could tolerate.  After a while, I started noticing things in the distance growing fuzzy.  I was so excited!  I remember being thrilled when I noticed that the carpet beneath me looked fuzzy. </p><p> </p><p>I was able to get by in middle school and my freshman year of high school by sitting in the front row.  By the time I reached my sophomore year, I couldn't fake it anymore.  Even from the front row, the chalkboard was too blurry for me to read.  I told my Mom about it, and got my first pair of glasses with an Rx of -2.00.  I kept trying to induce more myopia over the years, but my prescription finally stalled out at -5. </p><p> </p><p>I've been trying different experiments to induce more myopia, but am running out of options.  Getting lens implants is pretty much my only realistic option at this point.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2016, 14:52</p><p>Chino I do not drive anymore, my current vision doesn't allow it. I am at present living in the UK not USA. </p><p>Please tell me more about yourself.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2016, 14:25</p><p>David, </p><p> </p><p>Are you still able to drive in your state?  I know some states allow bioptic systems for drivers with low visual acuity.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2016, 13:57</p><p>The typical optician in Mumbai cannot dispense minus 54 glasses, the clinic ordered some lenses and five weeks is not an excess amount of time to get them made. The minus 39 GOC glasses helped but still I was needing support. </p><p>To have an uncontrollable need to be mega myopic is a curse and blessing. I love the result but tormented by the desires. VA of 20/80 is difficult at times, clarity of vision is good, size is very small.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2016, 09:45</p><p>juliette, </p><p>It is possible.  I would suggest some relatively inexpensive experimenting with  single vision distance glasses and contact lenses to see if you are comfortable with -9.00 glasses, before proceeding. </p><p>Frankly, I think the jump from +2.50 to -9.00 is too large for a first experience with GOC at your age. </p><p>Here are the results of some basic GOC calculations to give you an idea of what a GOC combo would look like for -9.00 glasses: </p><p>OD (Right)  -9.00/-0.25/140 Add +3.00 </p><p>OS ( Left)    -9.00/-0.50/40  Add +3.00 </p><p>Sphere only Contact Lens +10.50 </p><p>I won't go into the calculations right now, because that is NOT what I suggest you order for your first experience with GOC. </p><p>May I ask a few questions before making suggestions? </p><p>1. Have you ever worn Contact Lenses? </p><p>2. If so, do you know the Brand, Base Curve, and Diameter? </p><p>3. Have you had any problems with Dry Eyes? </p><p>4. Where do you live?

Why did it take a few weeks to get glasses to suit your requirements? Surely you could've walked into any opticians and done an eyetest which would have given you prescription or if you had GOC'd with this prescription prior to your operation, you would have been prepared with the correct glasses? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2016, 13:25</p><p>After I retired my GOC became fulltime and extreme. Then my natural RX was just under minus 10 but not high enough for my desires. </p><p>I spent the last year of work researching and contacting refractive surgeons all over the world. Not one positive reply. Then my luck changed. After retirement I was travelling through Asia and scoured Delhi for a possible doctor to make me a serious extreme myope. Again no luck. Except one put me in touch with a surgeon about to retire in Mumbai. Basically he agreed when a fat fee was discussed. </p><p>This was ten years ago. The doctor had a supply of implants from years of service. Many were issued only in Asia and not available in the west.  </p><p>The procedure was risky as both eyes were done together. He acquired some sample lens replacements which were unusually high. I was alone  with no commitments so I requested a maximum Rx,he also fitted verysyse aphakia iols to my irises. </p><p>The operation was done with me asleep. I woke up rather than excited but in a panic. Guys remember GOC is in your control, you can take out the cls. Suddenly I felt at risk, I couldn't see. My old GOC glasses, late minus 30s didn't help very much. It took five weeks to get the first glasses made for me. Very lonely frightening weeks. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2016, 21:58</p><p>That's an interesting idea, Cactus Jack.  I had not considered seeing a mental health professional for BIID.  I'll have to keep that in mind if the need arises. </p><p> </p><p>As far as I know, the high plus Visian ICL is only available overseas.  I'm very excited about the newer version with "CentraFLOW."  They basically put a channel in the center to allow for aqueous flow.  This makes it unnecessary to perform a peripheral iridotomy. </p><p> </p><p>LXW, I did find a place that was willing to perform the procedure on "good" eyes.  The facility is called Eagle Eye Centre.  They're located in Singapore.  Here is their website:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180811031035/http://www.eagleeyecentre.com.sg/" target="_blank">http://www.eagleeyecentre.com.sg/</a> </p><p> </p><p>I have not contacted the people at Eagle Eye Centre in about 6 years.  At the time, they were willing to implant the Visian ICL, Acrysof Cachet IOL, AND perform LASIK on me.  Since then, the Acrysof Cachet is no longer available in Singapore due to excessive endothelial cell loss. </p><p> </p><p>It would be interesting to learn if they are still willing to perform these procedures to induce myopia.  Please keep us informed.  I look forward to hearing what they say about your request.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2016, 13:16</p><p>LXW &amp; Chno, </p><p>If you really want to be "permanently" extremely Myopic, the Visian ICLs seem like a good way to do it.  I was not aware that they now make high Plus lenses.  For a long time they only did Minus lenses.  The really good thing about them is that they can be removed, so the procedure is somewhat reversible, but not as easily changed or reversed with GOC. </p><p>The thing you are running into with finding a surgeon willing to do the surgery is the Hippocratic Oath to "first do no harm".  The intense need to be very Myopic or very Hyperopic is thought to be a mild form of BIID (Body Integrity Identity Disorder).  In severe instances of BIID, the individual may want arms or legs amputated. </p><p>BIID is usually handled as a Psychological issue and you might consider that route.  If a Psychiatrist or Psychologist recommends Refractive Surgery, I think you are more likely to have some success.  Consulting with a Mental Health Professional (MHP) is a big psychological leap and a difficult decision.  Looking around for an MHP who specializes in BIID, might be a good place to start. </p><p>Regarding Visual Acuity (VA) with high Myopia.  Wearing very strong glasses with Minus lenses results in significant image minification on the Retina.  At some point, the elements in the image get so small that they will get lost in the image processing by the Retina and transmission to the Visual Cortex by the Optic Nerve.  While the Retina has a about 120 million Rods and Cones, the really important ones for VA are in the Fovea, around the Optic Nerve.  The Retina must do some image processing to combine signals from the Rods and Cones and deliver them to the approximately 1 million nerve fibers in the Optic Nerve.  When that occurs, very small image elements (i.e. small letter on a Snellen chart) may be unreadable.  It may not be possible to pass a drivers vision test with corrected very high Myopia. </p><p>At least people with high Myopia have an advantage over people with high Hyperopia - better peripheral vision.  High Minus glasses tend to act like Wide Angle camera lenses.  High Plus glasses act like binoculars with very limited peripheral vision.  </p><p>I have no experience with very high Minus glasses.  However, we are fortunate to have Specs4ever, who has personal experience driving with high Minus GOC.  Perhaps he will comment. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2016, 09:30</p><p>Ric, </p><p>It is very unlikely that your old glasses would be wearable with normal Sphere only contact lenses.  The problem is your Cylinder correction.  It is theoretically possible to find some Toric contacts that would enable her to wear your glasses, but it is practically impossible. </p><p>It would be better and probably less expensive, to design a GOC combo with contacts and inexpensive glasses from an on line retailer such as Zenni. </p><p>The place to start is with her complete glasses prescription.  If she wears CLs that is good, but often CL prescriptions are compromises, if she has any Astigmatism.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2016, 12:36</p><p>JoeS, </p><p>Even at its best, doing GOC is a very inexact science.  The calculations work pretty well below low double digits, but become more uncertain as you approach +/- 20 because of Vertex Distance effects, which are a square function of the glasses prescription.  Vertex Distance is very hard to measure or estimate and the number is very important in the calculations. </p><p>It is likely that you are in the process of learning an expensive lesson about doing GOC.  Try some +4.50 contact lenses.  You might get lucky.  If they don't work very well, try something different. </p><p>Let me know if you decide to start over. </p><p>To start over, the first thing needed is your complete actual prescription.  The second thing you need is to decide your desired glasses sphere prescription.  The third thing YOU need is your Contact Lens Brand, Base Curve, and Diameter for the most comfort. </p><p>The final glasses prescription may not be the exact desired prescription because the most desirable contact lenses selection is to use the same Sphere Only prescription for both eyes and adjust the final glasses prescription, in the combo, as needed. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2016, 17:20</p><p>Rupert, </p><p>You might just call and ask the receptionist if the doctor is interested in assisting you in doing Glasses over Contact Lenses.  The receptionist may not know what GOC means.  You may get a lot of NOs!, but all you need is one YES!, though it would be nice to have more than one. </p><p>The nice thing about a call, is that there is no embarrassment or rejection issues.  You may have to wait for a call back from the doctor. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rupert</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2016, 13:16</p><p>Thank you, Cactus Jack, for your response. I always enjoy your postings on this site. Yes, I'm around -4. I live in a very large metro area and there are lots of independent shopping center optometrists in the region, at strip malls, etc. I think lots of them take walk in appointments. So maybe I can work up some courage and stop by one of them one day and see what happens.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2016, 17:24</p><p>Rupert, </p><p>That may not be easy with an older ECP.  GOC, done right, is essentially harmless.  Your actual prescription must be around -4.00 for the GOC combination to work. </p><p>The very best way to do higher value GOC is with the help of an ECP.  It is easy, just put in the contacts and do a refraction.  One thing that can be beneficial, cost wise, is to use the same PLUS contact value for each eye and do the refraction.  The compensation will be automatic. </p><p>You may have to find another ECP and just ask if they will help you do GOC.  If the selected ECP does not sell glasses and contacts, they might be more willing to help and not be upset with the fact that you will order the glasses and contacts where ever you wish.  </p><p>In some states, the rules require that the OD be independent.  If you live in a larger city in the US, you might check your local Wal-Mart if it has a Vision Center.  Most ODs associated with a W-M will provide you with prescriptions and you can get them filled where you want. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rupert</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2016, 14:52</p><p>Hello. I do GOC with +4.75/+5 contacts and -10/-9.75 glasses and it works well. I do it for short periods because the plus contacts aren't as comfortable as my minus ones.  </p><p> </p><p>My question: have any of you worked with your eye doctor to perfect your combo? I have an appointment coming up and would like to get tips on how to bring the topic up without seeming too weird. I'd like to go up to -12 or so and it's hard to get contacts online now without a prescription. Plus, I'd like to do it safely and accurately. I'd even agree to buy everything from him.  </p><p> </p><p>BTW, I am in my late 40s (yes, bifocals) in USA and have had the same eye doc for about 20 years.  </p><p> </p><p>Thanks. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2016, 10:32</p><p>Pattie </p><p>What is your actual glasses prescription or do you have perfect eyesight and only do GOC so you can wear glasses? When you wear your -10.00 glasses what contact power do you wear with your glasses? Were you able to read close up wearing that combination or were you unable to read with that combination? Now that you have gotten new glasses with -15.00 lenses what is the prescription are you wearing for your contacts? If you were unable to read the price tag at the bakery your glasses must be over correcting your eyes too much and you probably need to increase your contacts a bit more. Were you able to see well enough to drive to the bakery wearing your new glasses? I'm sure you were probably thrilled that the lady at the bakery noticed your glasses and commented on them. That's what makes doing GOC even more fun. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pattie</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2016, 15:48</p><p>Hi, I have started GOC a few years ago and have been wearing -10 glasses so far. Today, I have gone out in public with my new -15 glasses. They are really thick. Felt a bit dizzy at first but after a while I got more used to it. In the bakery, the lady asked me if I have new glasses and that they look really strong. I admitted that my eyes have become really sore recently and that even with those glasses, I could not see the price tag for the bread in the display. She helped me out by saying the price again while looking intensely at my glasses. Felt awesome! </p><p>Hope to experience it more often. What is your favorite experience?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2016, 04:20</p><p>gwgs, </p><p>Not just people who do GOC.  Contacts can be hazardous if you don't use good Hygiene and if they are not properly fitted.  Fundamentally, they are a foreign object in the eye.  Albeit. if properly selected and fitted, a mostly comfortable one, good wearing practices MUST be observed. </p><p>I recently saw a piece on TV about a young man in University, who somehow acquired an Amoeba in his Cornea, under his CLs.  It nearly destroyed his Corneas before he sought medical attention. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2016, 04:11</p><p>Sparky, </p><p>This will sound a little strange, but with your prescription change and Vertex Distance effects, my calculations suggest getting some +10 contacts.  With + 10 contacts your glasses will need to be: </p><p>OD Right Eye Sphere -8.75 </p><p>OS Left Eye Sphere -7.50 </p><p>Note that I have reversed the order you listed your eyes.  It is traditional to list the Right Eye (OD) first </p><p>You need to append the appropriate Cylinder and Axis for each eye, if any </p><p>According to my calculations, the above combination will give you a smidgeon too much minus (about -0.15 diopters) in each eye. </p><p>The reason I asked your age is that as Presbyopia approaches, you have less ability to add extra Plus internally to compensate for calculation errors. </p><p>Please remember that GOC is a very inexact science.  There are NO guarantees that this combination will work for you.  I suggest ordering the least expensive glasses you can from an online retailer such as Zenni Optical.  If the combination is satisfactory, consider ordering some more expensive glasses with AR coatings etc, </p><p>Please let me know if you have any questions. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2016, 22:01</p><p>gwgs, </p><p>As I have said many times, I am not an Eye Care Professional.  I must defer to our ECPs for an "official" answer.  However, I can offer these thoughts. </p><p>Tears and the tear film between the CL and the Cornea play a vital role in the successful wearing of contacts.  I did not read the whole article, but on the surface, it seemed to me that they sensationalized something that is tragic for the young woman that should not have happened.   </p><p>I do not believe that 8 hours or any specific time period for contact wear i a hard an fast rule because everyone is different and even the difference is not constant. </p><p>When offered an opportunity, typically when advising someone about GOC, I discourage self prescribing contact lens Brand, Base Curve and Diameter.  I strongly suggest an exam for contacts, even if it cosmetic contacts, to get an accurate measurement of the corneal curvature and a matching CL to make sure that the contacts move around on the tear film.  Even if the contacts are high moisture, with high oxygen permeability, tears carry oxygen and nutrients to the Cornea, which has NO blood supply. </p><p>Another important element of a professional exam for contacts is training on insertion, removal, and what to do if you go to sleep with CLs that are not designed for overnight wear. </p><p>The most likely cause of a CL being stuck to the Cornea is forgetting to take them out before going to sleep.  While sleeping there is, of course, no blinking and the pressure of the eyelids can force soft CL against the Cornea.  I have know it to happen to one of my associates.  He was smart enough to go to his ECP on an emergency basis.  I can no longer wear CLs because of Dry Eye problems, but I had the same thing happen to me over a Saturday night.  I am not one to panic about anything, so I thought about the situation and used either Sterile Saline Solution or Multi-Purpose Solution (preferred) or Artificial Tears to bathe and re-moistureize the CL and my eye.  I dribbled the solution into my eye for a minute or so while very gently trying to move the CL on my Cornea with my finger tip (washed and rinsed my hands first making sure there was no soap residue).  After a couple of minutes, the CL released its grip and I was able to remove it normally.  I used Artificial Tears to fully re-moisturize my eye and didn't wear CLs for a few days. </p><p>The biggest clue that you have worn your CLs long enough is discomfort.  Also, you need to consider the environment.  In conditions of low humidity, you SHOULD use Artificial Tears with lubricant.  In extreme low humidity conditions (e.g. a 3 hour plus trip in a jet), you probably should not be wearing CLs at all. </p><p>If appropriate, put them in when you reach your destination. </p><p>The important thing is to follow your ECPs instructions about how long to wear CL.  They are the most familiar with your situation.  Modern, high moisture, soft contact lenses are very forgiving, but NOT 100% forgiving.  Even the best contact lenses cannot forgive sheer stupidity.   </p><p>If they were not reserved for the most egregious cases. the woman in the Sun article might get a casual mention at the Darwin Award ceremonies.  If you don't know what the Darwin Awards are, look them up on line. </p><p>I wold appreciate comments from our ECPs. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nemo</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2016, 21:14</p><p>Hey, just following-up to some comments about my prior post. </p><p> </p><p>I posted my ex-wife's glasses prescription: </p><p> </p><p>OD +2.25 -0.75 x 095 </p><p>OS +5.25 -0.75 x 117 </p><p> </p><p>Yes, it is quite a difference. She was 18 months old when she got glasses the first time and wore a patch over her right eye (OD) for a while during early childhood. Because her OD isn't very bad, she can easily accommodate through it (she's only 29), so she's always been able to see just fine without correction out of that eye. Her entire life she actually didn't know why she was supposed to wear glasses, until I explained it to her! </p><p> </p><p>The vertex distance thing actually works the opposite way for plus lenses, so her contact prescription is: </p><p> </p><p>OD +2.50 -0.75 x 090 </p><p>OS +5.50 -0.75 x 120 </p><p> </p><p>That's for Air Optix for Astigmatism. </p><p> </p><p>I said that my "real" contacts are -4.50, but I didn't provide much more detail. Sorry about that. My glasses prescription is: </p><p> </p><p>OD -5.00 </p><p>OS -5.00 </p><p> </p><p>Air Optix. </p><p> </p><p>Yeah, that's it. :-) The optometrist would like to have fitted -4.625 contacts for me, but as you know that doesn't happen in soft lenses, so he went with -4.50 instead of over-correcting. I can see 20/15 out of either eye this way anyway. </p><p> </p><p>So anyway, with my eyes wanting roughly -4.62 contacts, putting in -9.50 contacts brings me to a place where +4.87 contacts would correct it. I looked at a vertex distance conversion table, and at 12 mm, +4.75 would be the same as +5.00 on the eye, and +4.50 at 12 mm would be the same as +4.75 on the eye. </p><p> </p><p>Since I need in between, I could go between +4.75 and +4.50 for the glasses. As +4.75 would be a slight over-correction and might make me more nearsighted, and I know I have reasonable accommodation still in my early-30s, I elected to go for the +4.50 instead. </p><p> </p><p>So I hope that explains better why I ended up going with that, Cactus Jack and gwgs! </p><p> </p><p>By the way, does anyone here know if there's a place to get RGPs online without having to send in an actual prescription? I've been in a discussion with my doctor about possibly switching to RGPs; if I do, it would be nice to be able to do GOC that way as well! I could also eventually get much stronger glasses since you can do RGPs with stronger prescriptions than soft lenses. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks! </p><p>Nemo</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;21 Oct 2016, 19:22</p><p>nemo, </p><p>That seems like a pretty good choice, given the limited information you provided. I like to start with a complete glasses prescription because contact lens prescription are often compromises to avoid topics. </p><p>Assuming your-4.50 contact lenses are correct and that you have no astigmatism your Eye's refractive power without correction is the opposite sign of your CL power or +4.50.  If you wear -9.50 CLs the resulting refractive power would be -5.00.   </p><p>We are accustomed to doing calculations of Vertex Distance effects for Minus Glasses by squaring the lens power, dividing the result by 1000 and then multiplying  by the vertex distance in mm.  We SUBTRACT that number form the glasses sphere and that yields the CL equivalent.  For Plus Glasses we follow the same procedure, but ADD the result to the glasses prescription to get the equivalent CL prescription.  In this case for a 12 mm Vertex Distance you get a VD effect of approximately 0.25.  If you add that number to the glasses sphere prescription you get +4.75. </p><p>The +4.75 does not exactly match the -5.00, but that is not a problem, because your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses should be able to supply an additional +0.25, internally to provide crisp vision. </p><p>Good work. </p><p>C.  </p><p></p><hr>

I was inspired many years ago to try GoC upon happening to get a girlfriend (later wife) who was hyperopic, anisometropic, and mildly amblyopic. I wanted to see what it was like to wear her glasses, so after finding out her prescription, I got contacts that would do a reasonable job. Unfortunately she has astigmatism which I didn't correct for so it wasn't perfect. </p><p> </p><p>By the way, her last prescription is: </p><p>OD +2.25 -0.75 x 095 </p><p>OS +5.25 -0.75 x 117 </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, many years later now she has left me so I can't wear her glasses anymore, and she didn't like me doing that anyway. But I really enjoyed the plus lenses, and I still had some -9.50 contacts here, so I decided to get a pair of glasses with plus lenses that would work with these. </p><p> </p><p>After doing the calculations I ended up getting +4.50 glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I have to say, I am very impressed. It makes me wish I was farsighted, and jealous of those who are! I don't know what it is, but it just feels very good. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, just thought I'd share. :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2016, 11:38</p><p>TSK: The math suggests: OD +8.00 x -.25 x 5; OS +7.75 x -.50 x 20 glasses over -7 contacts with a VD of .013. It is essentially the reciprocal of the calculation for - glasses over + contacts. </p><p> </p><p>If you went to -10 contacts at .013 VD, the glasses would be OD +11.75 x -.25 x 5; OS +11.50 x -.50 x 20. In any case your astigmatic prescription does not change, and the only difference would be in the SPH. </p><p> </p><p>These numbers simply reflect the fact that the power of a lens is inversely proportional to the distance from it.

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2016, 07:03</p><p>Tsk, while Cactus Jack is correct in thinking that in order for an accurate combination you need to provide better and more information, what you think is not true. With a minus contact and plus glasses it is the reverse of wearing plus contacts with minus glasses. If your eyesight is perfect, wearing a +7D contact with -7D glasses you would have been over corrected by about -0.50D, which is easily overcome by accommodation, or by wearing the glasses slightly lower on your nose.  But you can't accommodate for plus lenses, nor can you wear them lower on your nose, so in this case you would need to add about +0.50 or maybe +0.75D to your glasses to get reasonable vision,  Of course this suggestion depends on the wearer and their ability to decipher the blur.</p><p></p><hr>

You will need the following: </p><p>1.  A book or newspaper with typical sized text. (the target) </p><p>2. A tape measure or yard stick.  </p><p>3. Some Over-the-Counter (OTC) reading glasses in the +1.50 range. </p><p>The purpose of the +1.50 reading glasses is to make you artificially nearsighted so the distance readings will be in a convenient range, but not so much as to make accurate measurements difficult.  You may be able to find a very low cost reading glasses at one of the "dollar" stores. </p><p>Here is the test: </p><p>1. With the +1.50 glasses on, hold the target about 16 inches away from your eyes.  The text should be very clear. </p><p>2. Move the target away from you until the edges of the text just becomes a little fuzzy. </p><p>3. Measure the distance and make a note of it. </p><p>Do the above 3 times and average the distance.  Tell me the average distance. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John London</b>&nbsp;18 Aug 2016, 04:17</p><p>Following recent conversations; please forgive me a few lines of experience.  </p><p> </p><p>My real glasses have -33 sph and -4.5 zyl in by better eye.

<p><b>Josh</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2016, 23:34</p><p>Hi bracesfan, </p><p> </p><p>Does that mean that you wear +8 contacts with -12 glasses? I'm confused. Thanks!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bracesfan</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2016, 23:24</p><p>It´s not quite true that GOC with so high cylinder would be impossible and glasses not wearable. Contacts with high cylinder are easy to get though they are pricey: Proclear makes their XR up to 6 diopters and then there are many custom made contacts for keratoconus. But as far as I am concerned the best solution are Hydrasoft Options by Cooper. My combo with them is +0,50/-11 cyl in glasses and +6,50/-10 cyl in contacts. The combo is wearable, surely not for long time. Just a few hours and only for basic orientation. The BCV is about 40/100 for me. Contacts take quite long time for centration but then keep the axe orientation surprisingly well. The +/- combination in glasses is generally very exciting. I have another glasses with +8/-12 cyl combination and considering going up to +12/-17. The extreme elongation with such a combo is stunning.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2016, 12:59</p><p>Josh, </p><p>Successful GOC requires effort and planning.  You need to know your actual prescription, even if it is 0.00 in each eye. </p><p>You need to know the Base Curve and Diameter of contact lenses.  Also, how to insert and remove them, and care for them.  Hygiene is VERY important when wearing contact lenses. </p><p>I have a few questions for you. </p><p>1. What is your age? </p><p>2. Where do you live (country)? </p><p>3. What is your Major? </p><p>4. What is your year in College? </p><p>5. When was your last eye exam? </p><p>6. What is your eye color? </p><p>7.

Can you read unlighted distant signs, easily? </p><p>Some of these questions may seem of no consequence, but they affect our suggestions. </p><p>If you have not had a recent eye exam and think you have perfect vision, it is possible that your refractive error is so low that glasses would offer little or no benefit or it is possible that you have some Hyperopia.  Hyperopia is the only type of refractive error that you can correct internally, often without your even begin aware of it. </p><p>I can suggest a couple of simple tests that you can do to get an idea of your actual refractive error.

<p><b>rimpopper</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2016, 08:57</p><p>For Josh from a previous post: "Theres something you should consider if you dont need or wear contacts. You should get a finial contact lens prescription to determine the base curve, diameter and power of the contacts. You can gamble that what you order will work, but I wouldnt do that. You can get a cosmetic contact lens prescription that includes the base curve and the diameter you need even if you dont need any correction.  </p><p> </p><p>I would amend that by saying "Do not gamble at all." Contacts are serious business, even more so when you add an astigmatic correction. If you don't wear glasses or contacts, then the assumption is you don't have astigmatism. If you don't have it, you should never adjust the prescription to include it. </p><p> </p><p>Cancel the glasses order or send them to "New Eyes for the Needy." Then start over and go slow. After 16 years I only use +10 contacts over my own -4 prescription.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2016, 07:06</p><p>Josh, </p><p>If you REALLY have 20/20 vision without correction, you made several big, potentially expensive, mistakes.  The biggest was the very high Cylinder correction.  The next biggest was ordering VERY high minus Sphere glasses to start GOC.  It will be extremely difficult to find some contact lenses that yield a wearable combination. </p><p>You are asking someone to do lengthy calculations for you that are essentially a waste of time and effort, because it appears that you do not understand very basic optics or vision. </p><p>You can calculate to your hearts content, but the contacts will probably need to be custom made, "vial" lenses.  The APPROXIMATE power will be: </p><p>Sphere +15.00, Cylinder +5.75 Axis 60 Toric lenses. </p><p>The contact lenses WILL NOT be inexpensive.  IF you can get the contacts, the combo probably WILL NOT be wearable.  The biggest problem with the contacts would be keeping the contacts properly oriented on your corneas.  They need to move around a little on the Cornea to allow the tear film under them to be refreshed.  The Corneas do not have a blood supply and have to get their Oxygen from the Air and moisture and nutrients from the tear film.  If toric contacts rotate as you blink, your vision with them will vary from fair to terrible at the most inappropriate times. </p><p>If you are smart, you will try to cancel the Zenni order and start over.  However, I think you are the type of person who needs to stick your hand in a fire to prove to yourself that it is hot.  That knowledge would come at a high price and result in severe burns. </p><p>Improperly done GOC also comes at a high price and wearing improperly fitted contact lenses can result in permanent Corneal damage.  Vision actually occurs in the brain and your brain has to learn to "see" with radically changed images from your two eyes.  The bigger the change, the longer it takes.  People with natural high myopia did not suddenly get that way.  They probably needed minus glasses in childhood and their myopia increased at 1 or 2 diopters per year. </p><p>If you are really serious, we can help you take advantage of the experience of our members, but you need to follow the advice, if you want to have success. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rimpopper</b>&nbsp;12 Aug 2016, 23:53</p><p>Zero 6 DW vial contact lenses (American Hydron) ranging from -20 to +20 are available from www.saveonlens.com. You simply attest to the fact that it is your prescription. I've used +10 lenses in each eye successfully for the last 2 years. I combine them with OD -15.00 -1.00 x 90 and OS -15.75 -.75 x 45 glasses and I have perfect visual acuity. </p><p> </p><p>I have used GOC since 2000, but I began at a much lower level - about +5.00. I successfully combined them with -10.00 glasses. Those who say go slow are correct.  </p><p> </p><p>Vertical distance does not matter very much until you get past a negative 10 or so with the glasses. After that, each added millimeter of VD adds about .25 diopter to the required prescription. I can't speak to the positive glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I learned this by trial and error and created a spreadsheet using my actual prescription  that performs the calculations for me. I can enter, for example, a positive contact lens prescription and it will produce a precise prescription for the correct glasses.  Everyone is unique, and I learned that my VD with most glasses is 14 mm. The range appears to be between 11 and 15 mm. with 12 or 13 mm. the most common. </p><p> </p><p>It is also essential that you do not adjust in any way the cylinder, axis or prism details of your prescription. If you don't wear glasses, you can ignore them. It helps if you start with a recent refraction for both glasses and for contact lenses. I've worn both for years, and I simply entered my current prescription into the spreadsheet. The formula is simple and straightforward, but you must be careful with the + and  signs.  </p><p> </p><p>The best eyeglass fit seems to be bridge width (BW) + lens width (LW) = pupillary distance (PD). If your PD is 68, for example, then a frame with a BW of 18 and a LW of 50 works well. Likewise, a BW of 20 and a LW of 48 also works.  </p><p> </p><p>Finally, the calculators that have appeared here from time to time are quite accurate, and you can use them with confidence.

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2016, 05:24</p><p>hyperaficionado, that sounds like a good plan. I will say from a lot of experience that when a plus script goes from +16 to +20 there is a significant drop in ease of wear. It's just harder to see out of +20 lenses than +16 lenses, and though you can get used to the differences you can't fully compensate or make up for them. The biggest challenge of course is the loss of peripheral vision. You can learn to turn your head instead of your eyes to see to the side, but that only works if objects are stationary. Just wait until you go into a crowded shopping area with people moving in all directions. You'll look a like a bobblehead trying to keep everything in sight! </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, I never found the magnification or distortion to be much of an issue after the first few days, but the limited visual field still is after all these years. And as the lenses get stronger, the limits of your visual fields get closer and closer to your center of vision. </p><p> </p><p>Good luck! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2016, 06:26</p><p>hyperaficionado, </p><p>At least, you have been in the "pool" and know how to swim.  Many people, who try high prescription GOC at the start, find the shock of their visual experience so uncomfortable and marginally wearable, that they give up.  In the past, the only people who experienced such a huge vision change had the choice between very poor or no vision and the limited vision of high PLUS Cataract glasses.  There was no going back. Also, recovery from the surgery was months rather than minutes, hours, or at the most a day or so, as is frequently experienced today with IOLs. </p><p>I would suggest perhaps +12, +16 and +20, but it is your choice.  At 37, you to need to get pretty close on the combination because you probably have limited Accommodation Amplitude to compensate by contributing much internal PLUS.  The trick there is to use a little MORE Minus in the CLs than you calculate, but remember that high prescription CLs only come in 0.50 increments.  As NJ said, you can also move the glasses some to take advantage of the VD effects. </p><p>Using the example I offered, do you feel comfortable doing your own calculations?  One thing to always remember that high prescription GOC is a VERY inexact science.  There are no guarantees of good results.   </p><p>C.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>helpful</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2016, 01:38</p><p>Would just point out that Globallens in Canada stopped providing contacts without your prescription some months ago apparently following pressure from the USA. Other persons here have asked where you can get contacts over the strength of 20 without prescription and not sure anyone has replied as to a source.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2016, 22:12</p><p>hyperaficionado, one other consideration. The power of the contact lenses will depend somewhat on the style of eyeglass lens you choose. Lenticular lenses, the kind that look like a fried egg, have a front power surface that sits a little closer to your eye, whereas a full field lens has this a little further away because it is much thicker. If you go with a full field lens you might want to up the power of the contact lenses by a diopter or so. </p><p> </p><p>Though much harder to find, it's entirely possible to get a full field lens made in this prescription. It requires what's called a 'free form generator' to make the blank, but with digital lens making, it's actually quite available. Lenticular lenses will be easier to get. Both work equally well, or equally poorly, depending on your viewpoint. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2016, 21:55</p><p>hyperaficionado, it's not quite as difficult as CJ's calculations might suggest. </p><p> </p><p>My first GOC combo was with +20 glasses too. Back then, without the Internet, I had to do the vertex correction using the lens equation for multiple elements. My hyperopia was similar to yours, and I got a number around -24 for the contact lenses, though I don't recall exactly. </p><p> </p><p>Well, it turns out that getting an accurate number is not all that critical, with one important caveat, because you can change the power of the glasses just by moving them a little bit up or down your nose, a diopter here or there doesn't matter.  </p><p> </p><p>However, and here's the caveat, if the contact lenses are too weak, you won't be able to move the glasses close enough to your eyes to focus. However, if the contacts are a little too strong, you can always make up for this by using your accommodation, if you're still young, or by moving the glasses a little bit down your nose. So in your position I might order -25 or -26 contacts, which are available from places like Globallens in Vancouver. You just fine tune your vision by moving the glasses until everything pops into focus.  </p><p> </p><p>As far as getting used to them, it does take some time. However, I didn't find it to be that difficult. And remember that in the old days, people who had cataract surgery had to wear high plus glasses right away, though not usually as high as +20.  </p><p> </p><p>Good luck! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2016, 08:30</p><p>hyperaficionado, </p><p>Yes, you do need some help, but probably in more way than you realize.  That statement is not intended to be critical or judgmental. </p><p>The math is not very difficult, but it can be confusing when you first start working with GOC.  The confusion comes from the fact that corrective glasses and contact lenses are the inverse of the actual refractive error and the nature of Vertex Distance effects.  The BIG problem comes when your brain has to learn to process a massively different visual experience.  I have a few questions that relate to doing GOC, but first let me ask some seemingly innocuous questions about swimming. </p><p>Do you know how to swim?  Assume for a moment that you do not know how.  Would you climb up to the Olympic high diving board (10 meters) and dive into 5 meters of water with no training or first learning how to swim?   </p><p>Unfortunately, that sounds pretty much what you are wanting to do with +20 GOC glasses.  The inclination to "jump into the deep end" is very common with people who are inexperienced with GOC.  High PLUS GOC seems to be more difficult to get used to than high MINUS GOC. </p><p>Now some GOC related questions: </p><p>1. What is your age?  (To get an idea of your Accommodation Amplitude and your ability to compensate for errors) </p><p>2. Where do you live? (To get an idea of how difficult it will be for you to get GOC Contacts and Glasses) </p><p>3. Have you ever worn contact lenses? </p><p>4. Haver your ever done any GOC? </p><p>5. If so, what was the prescription range? </p><p>I will show you the theoretical calculations, but the practical accuracy at very high prescriptions is likely incorrect. </p><p>Step 1.  Calculate the Vertex Distance (VD) effects of +20 glasses: </p><p>Square the glasses power: +20 x +20 = 400 (note that the sign is actually lost) </p><p>Divide by 1000: 400/1000 = 0.40 (VD effects in Diopters per mm) </p><p>Multiply by the Actual VD of the glasses.  (Note VD is very hard to measure or estimate in advance.  Typical is 10 to 12 mm)  0.40 x 12 = 4.8 diopters </p><p>The question is: What do you do with that number.  For PLUS glasses, you ADD it to the glasses power to get the equivalent CL power.  For MINUS glasses you SUBTRACT it from the glasses power.  IOW, the glasses power at the cornea is +24.8.  You would need -24.8 contacts to compensate for the +20 glasses. </p><p>Step 2 Consider the effects of the refractive power of your eyes. </p><p>If you need +2.25 Sphere correction (VD factors are nil below about =/- 4.50) your eyes already have a refractive power of -2.25 (I call it eye power).  That reduces the -24.8 to -22.55 or -22.50.  Good luck buying those. </p><p>Step 3.  Transfer the Cylinder and Axis directly to the GOC glasses WITHOUT ANY changes. </p><p>Step 4.  Anticipate severe nausea (motion sickness) when you try the combination, so have a trash can or other container handy. </p><p>Step 5.  Be prepared to exercise extreme caution when going down stairs, stepping off curbs, or tripping over unseen objects on the floor or ground. </p><p>You can learn to deal with all of this, but it takes time and it is best approached slowly to give your brain time to learn how to deal with the limitations of wearing high PLUS glasses. </p><p>The motion sickness occurs because when you move your head, the apparent speed of motion you see, is MUCH faster than your semicircular canals in your ears, sense.  That difference is what causes motion sickness. </p><p>Very high plus glasses are like wearing binoculars or looking through tubes.  You have NO useful peripheral vision. </p><p>The very best way to do high prescription GOC is with the help of a "friendly" Eye Care Professional.  You can do lower prescription GOC using calculations as long as you start low and work up.  Remember, at +20 the VD effects are 0.40 diopters per mm.  A 1 mm error is almost 2 optical steps in your vision with the glasses. </p><p>I hope this helps.  Please let me know what you plan to do.

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2016, 20:47</p><p>There is a lot more than just a diopter or two of cylinder on the front of Soyuz's biconcave lenses, that is more like -7 of sphere sticking out of the front.  Many years ago I got a pair from goggles4u with -8 worth of minus thrown onto the front side of a biconcave lense like that.  Not sure if they still consistently do that, and they seem to only go up to -15 now.  Glad to hear Soyuz that your biconcave lenses are working for you.  I found splitting the power that much to the front to be too much distortion, though it can really cut down on lens thickness.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Trent</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 09:38</p><p>Soyuz </p><p> </p><p>The description of your goc experience sounds so much like you were meant to have high myopia.  I can read into your last post that this experience completes you and I sensed no hesitation or embarrassment on your part of becoming extremely nearsighted and going out into public.  I would be interested in hearing from you Soyuz what it is like when you put on those +14.5 contacts and then the -18 glasses and walk around.  How much time are you spending with goc?  Do you think you can post a picture of your new Zenni glasses? Soyuz Im so happy that your goc experience has been such a positive one! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 09:15</p><p>Soyuz, </p><p>I am glad to hear that you are enjoying your adventures into GOC.  I recall that you said you were 32.  Generally, that means that you have some accommodation available to add some PLUS to compensate for too little PLUS in the contacts or too much minus in the glasses, by using your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses to "fine tune" the combination.  The important thing is to not depend too much on accommodation to correct any mismatch. </p><p>It is better to have a bit less PLUS in the contacts than you really need, than to have too much PLUS.  Your Ciliary Muscles can add a bit more PLUS if you need it, but they absolutely cannot subtract from or reduce the fully relaxed PLUS in your Crystalline Lenses. </p><p>Thank you for the comments about ordering existing glasses and trying to make them work for GOC.  I no longer respond to GOC questions asked by people who do not know their actual prescription or have purchased "mystery" glasses on line.  They have made a really bad decision and want help trying to make the decision a good one.  I don't know the exact odds, but I suspect they are less favorable than winning a lottery or getting struck by lightning when the nearest cloud is hundreds or thousands of miles/km away.  It is a waste of my time and their money. </p><p>Please let us know how the +15 CLs work. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soyuz</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 06:24</p><p>My experiences with GOC according to our calculations from 30 May 2016. </p><p>First of all thank you very much DS and Cactus Jack for all your efforts helping me with GOC. I have ordered glasses from ZENNI Optical with the following prescription recommended by DS: </p><p> </p><p>OD -18.00 -1.50 x 177 </p><p> </p><p>OS -18.25 -0.75 x 180 </p><p> </p><p>The calculation was made for +15 contact lenses but I just started to use it with +14,5 contacts. I have ordered already the +15s. </p><p> </p><p>My experiences: </p><p>1. If you want to enjoy GOC with quality view and best vision conditions, do the calculation and order glasses from online optical stores instead of buying less quality glasses from ebay with high prescription. My new glasses are very beautiful with nice cut in, good standard and nice lenses in it. I cant compare with the older ones ordered from ebay sellers. </p><p>2. I can see with this combination already very clear but as recommended and calculated, in the future I will use it with the +15 contacts for the best possible vision. Reading makes me a little problem but seeing far and clear, goes perfectly as I was dreaming about. I have already tried my new glasses in public, in shopping centers and in the street. Simpy wonderful feeling and the glasses fit perfectly on my face. The glasses cost me only aprox 30-40 USD including post, that is the almost the same you spend for ebay auctions. </p><p> </p><p>My advice to everybody: if you want to enjoy GOC as a life experience with as perfect as possible vision, follow the tips from experienced users. Do an accurate eyetest (nowadays is free in many optical stores), let make a calculation according to you vision, contact lenses you want to use and order the glasses calculated for you eyes from online optical shop. My world and life changed totally with this new experience.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2016, 04:51</p><p>gwgs </p><p> </p><p>Just curious, but if your eyes still have such great accommodation at 30, have you tried inducing some myopia? I would have thought that by wearing -1 glasses every day you would be myopic in no time. </p><p> </p><p>And I'd love to see those big frames of yours. 62 cm! Wow! I guess they must be vintage. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2016, 04:04</p><p>CJ - I understand the maths and the vertex distance in relation to pushing the glasses further down my nose which makes them weaker, but we are talking maybe a difference of 1cm in terms of where they are both positioned. </p><p> </p><p>The supposed -15 myodiscs do not sit right at the top of my nose, as they are big frames (I think I posted before their dimensions but the frame size is something like 62mm) and they cover my eyebrows if I push them right up, plus the back of the lenses rub against my eyebrows / face which obviously isn't ideal, so I position them a little down my nose.  </p><p> </p><p>With the -21.5 myodiscs I've worn them several times now (indoors) and wore them for about 4 hours on Sunday whilst watching tv, having lunch, using my phone / ipad etc and had them probably half way down my nose in order get the optimum vision for reading the score on the TV and being able to operate my phone and the tv remote but am amazed that I can actually wear these, and its rather exciting to think that I can order some others in such a high prescription and just make allow to them sit a little further down my nose. </p><p> </p><p>With regard to your comment Rafa about having such a large amount of accommodation, I'm surprised also, as I don't wear any sort of correction at all but at 30 years old it has been suggested that my eyes are young enough to be flexible friends :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2016, 13:51</p><p>I'm really at a loss with regards to vertex distance. </p><p>Vertex Distance is not easy to understand.  It helps if you understand some basic math along with optics.  You have to keep three factors in mind.  One, Corrective lenses are the opposite sign of actual Refractive Error. Two, Vertex Distance effects are opposite, depending on glasses lens sign. Vertex Distance increases REDUCE MINUS lens effectiveness.  Vertex Distance increases INCREASE PLUS lens effectiveness. Three, Vertex Distance measurement is difficult and not very accurate without expensive measuring tools, which few ECPs have.  </p><p>I know you said that GOC is not a mathematical science. But in my case, vertex distance doesn't seem to be a factor at all. </p><p>I think is said that GOC is not an EXACT science.  It IS a mathematical science.  Th problem is that the exact distance from the Cornea to the glasses is very hard to estimate before getting the glasses or measuring it exactly after you get them.  Vertex Distance effects are the mathematical square of the glasses prescription.  This is where the understanding of math come in.  If you do the math for Vertex Distance effects of -2.75 glasses it comes out to 0.0075 diopters per mm which is essentially negligible at any realistic and reasonable Vertex Distance.  The same formula is used for calculating CL prescriptions using Refracted Prescriptions and CL and Glasses Sphere prescriptions are the same until  Refracted Prescriptions get up to about +/- 4.00 to 4.50.  Refracted Prescriptions and Glasses Prescriptions are very close because the Vertex Distance for both is around 10 to 12 mm.  I generally use 12 mm for calculating GOC combinations. </p><p>I am GOC'ing with my -9´s over +5.25 CL's, which is the combo resulting from the mathematical operation you did. </p><p>I based my suggestions on a 12 mm  Vertex Distance.  If you are able to wear your glasses closer than that, they will have more MINUS effect and you will need more PLUS in the GOC contact, but maybe not +6.25. </p><p>As I've said in previous posts, I have trouble reading close distance with this combo, so much that I have trouble distinguishing the different coins, let alone reading my phone. Of couse, I have presbyopia (+2) but I don't have such a huge problem with my regular glasses. </p><p>Do your -2.75 glasses have an Add?  Do your -9.00 GOC glasses have an Add?  I dont think you will notice much of the Wide Angle depth of field effects I mentioned previously with a bit of over correction and in lower light conditions with -9.00 glasses.   </p><p>It turns out I'm clearly overcorrected. I've just done the experiment of putting on some +1 reading glasses over my combo, and I could see better in the long distance than without the +1 add. So that means that my contact lenses should +6.25 for my -9 glasses, and the difference between them is -2.75, which is my regular prescription. Which means that the vertex distance is totally irrelevant in my case. </p><p>I agree that you are overcorrected and Presbyopia is making it worse.  It appears that you believe you are immune to the laws of optical physics and any calculations will be irrelevant.  Therefore, you should NOT bother with them even at very high prescriptions.  There is a saying here: Knowledge comes from the things you read.  Experience comes from the things you DID NOT read.  Some people need to learn by Experience.  That is natural and there is nothing wrong with that, if you can afford the experiences. </p><p>It's true that I normally wear my glasses very tightly tuck behind me ears and therefore the lenses are very close to my cornea, but I'm puzzled about all this. I also wonder if the thickness of the lenses of the glasses is a factor, meaning that the thicker the lenses, the closer they are from the cornea? </p><p>Lens thickness is NOT generally considered to be a factor because what matters for most people is the distance from the optical center of the lens to the Cornea (Vertex Distance).  These days, thickness at the optical center of MINUS glasses depends primarily on Lens Material Strength and Safety considerations.  Lens design can affect Vertex Distance in MINUS lenses if the edges of the lens are thick enough and set far enough back in the frames to touch the face and force the glasses forward. </p><p>Now I'm about to order the matching contact lenses for my new -19 myodiscs and, bearing all this vertex distance issue in mind, I'm not sure what to order. </p><p>For most people doing GOC, Vertex Distance effects for -19 glasses would be 0.361 diopters per mm.  If I were to guess at your Vertex Distance (which is all I can do) and use 10 mm because you like to wear your glasses as close as possible, I would suggest either +12.50 or +13.00.  However, you might also consider more PLUS than that because of your Presbyopia and inability to get bifocals or progressives in the -19 glasses.  High prescription GOC is a very INEXACT science, which is why I normally suggest that it be approached slowly and carefully, which you have decided NOT to do. </p><p>I wonder if anyone has had the same experience. </p><p>Please share your experiences with rafa, including both good and bad ones. </p><p>Any thoughts on this, CJ, would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>I have expressed mine above.  I wish you the very best.  I just hope you understand that you are conducting an experiment in optical physics and there are many variables whose value, you dont know, and are difficult or impossible to determine in advance.  Vertex Distance is a very significant factor.   </p><p>If you have difficulty with close vision, I suggest you consider some clip-on, flip-up, magnifiers such as those offered by Rx Safety Glasses of New Jersey, USA.  They are not very expensive and are available from +1.00 to +5.00 ( if I remember right).  Their website is www.rx-safety.com   Look under Magnifying Products. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Trent</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2016, 11:01</p><p>rafa </p><p> </p><p>I have the same issue as you and need a progressive or bifocal in the -14 range.  I thought about ordering 2 pair from Zenni, one for distance and one for reading.  This arrangement is not preferred because youre always switching glasses.  Maybe try <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180811031035/http://www.optical4less.com/" target="_blank">http://www.optical4less.com/.</a>  Let me know what optical store you choose. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2016, 10:42</p><p>I've just checked that Zenni doesn't do bifocals for glasses with a prescription of over -9 anyway.  </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if there is any other online opticians where they do them...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2016, 09:29</p><p>When a presbyope who is slightly nearsighted removes their glasses, they are switching from the distance focus that their glasses are set at and a more closer focus that their eyes are naturally set at by being myopic.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2016, 09:20</p><p>rafa - well if you need +2 as it is for reading, then I understand now why you want / need them. So I would've thought you will definitely need at least +2 but as CJ has said previously, higher minus lenses may help compensate this. </p><p> </p><p>I have often found it strange that people will very weak minus glasses take them off to read / look at things close up. Does anyone know why this is as we have established that wearing strong minus glasses one can easily read wearing them, so why do I know several people with a tiny short sighted prescription that take their glasses off to look at their phone / read?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2016, 04:35</p><p>With -17 sliding the lenses 7mm away from your eyes down your nose will effectively reduce the power by 2 diopters.  That may be all you need to do for reading, though everything will be a little smaller...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2016, 02:23</p><p>gwgs and Cactus Jack </p><p> </p><p>Thank you so much for your advice. </p><p> </p><p>The truth is that with my -9 (over +5.25) I can't read my phone. I definitely need a susbtantial add. </p><p> </p><p>In my "real life" I need at least a +2 add to read properly. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe with -17 over +11  (or a -13 over, say, +8, I haven't done the maths) is a totally different scenario. But I can't imagine not needing an add for reading as it's been very long since I was able to read without an add! </p><p> </p><p>gwgs </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps the reason, and I'm just guessing, why you didn't adapt to the bifocals is the fact that you don't have any presbyopia and your eye muscle can easily accommodate to the different distances, as I believe you are a lot younger than I am. But I have been wearing bifocals and progressives for a long time and I can negotiate stairs and curbs easily with them. It does take a bit of time getting used to bifocals, so if you like them, I would encourage you to keep giving them a go. I myself started using them before I really needed them. It's fun to be able to switch from one vision field to the other. </p><p> </p><p>In any case, once I get the matching lenses for my single vision -17's I will find out whether I need an add for reading or not. So I will take your advice and not order bifocals until then. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2016, 01:10</p><p>Rafa - I have tried GOC'ing with bifocals, and without bifocals, and as CJ says, I have been more comfortable without the bifocal add in. I would like to do GOC with bifocals, as it's another bow in the arrow to coin a phrase (i.e. another accessory that I love about glasses) but from previous experience, the bifocal part makes it harder to negotiate the difference in levels one experiences in day to day life (i.e. stairs, pavements etc). </p><p> </p><p>I can read perfectly clearly any small text off my phone or in a newspaper / magazine without the need for bifocals and would suggest you try without</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2016, 08:20</p><p>rafa, </p><p>You may find that you need less add or even none with higher minus glasses.   </p><p>I  had cataract surgery with single vision IOLs 15 years ago.  My final prescription is pretty low (Mono vision R -1.50, L +0.50 with some astigmatism) and I can function in a pinch without glasses, but prefer trifocals for excellent vision. </p><p>I mention the above because with a GOC combination using +12 contacts and single vision -14 glasses (approximate) (actual prescription adjusted to achieve the same good distance VA in both eyes), I can read very well without the Add. </p><p>Many years ago, when I originally ordered the combo, I ordered bifocals with an Add of about +2.75 from Zenni.  At that time, they were unable to supply bifocals in that prescription. Instead supplied a second pair of glasses with a  prescription 2.75 diopters LESS than the first pair.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they were OK, but I really did not need the second pair for reading. I don't know if Zenni offers bifocals in glasses with prescriptions that high, today. </p><p>I believe the ability to read without the Add in the -14 glasses is related to the very wide depth of field (range of useful focus) exhibited by wide angle camera lenses and inexpensive single focus disposable film cameras.  Depth of field is also related to the "pinhole" optical effect that is exhibited by the higher "f" stops in high end camera lenses and your eyes in bright light.   </p><p>High MINUS glasses exhibit similar optical characteristics as Wide Angle Camera Lenses and the "barrel" or "pincushion" distortion exhibited by high MINUS glasses lenses is similar to the distortion exhibited by Extreme Wide Angle Lenses called "fisheye" lenses. </p><p>My suggestion is to try the higher MINUS glasses in single vision before you try to order bifocals or progressives.  You may be pleasantly surprised. </p><p>Please let us know what you decide and your experiences. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2016, 01:39</p><p>gwgs </p><p> </p><p>Yes, you're totally right. I meant +11!! </p><p> </p><p>I think I have the maths right for the combo, yes. I've used the same parameters as in my first combo (courtesy of Cactus Jack). And since my real rx is -2.75 on both eyes, it does sound about right that for the -17 glasses the CL match for is +11. (It is, in fact, +10.75, but I think I want to have that little extra +0.25 to make it a little easier for reading). </p><p> </p><p>And yes, it's a huge jump! I will also order some new bifocal glasses in the region of -13, as my -9 are single vision and I have some presbyopia. Does the add for presbyopia increase when using glasses with this sort of high power? I have a feeling it does. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, I'm soooo excited to be discovering this whole new world of GOC!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2016, 01:05</p><p>Rafa - sounds good and I can't wait to hear how you get on with the -17's, this is a BIG step up from you have started doing so I'm intrigued to see how you'll do! </p><p> </p><p>Surely you mean +12 contacts, not -12 as you don't want to do -17 over -12 do you!

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2016, 11:41</p><p>It's amazing how well I'm adapting to the GOC combo after only a couple of weeks. I had to stop doing it for a week because I had family over, but I've started doing it again and after two sessions I feel great. The dizzying feeling is gone and the vision is pretty crisp. I can't wait to venture outside the flat again. </p><p> </p><p>Also, I have just received a pair of -17 myodisc glasses that I bought on Ebay and I'm delighted with them. They are bigger than I thought they would be (which I love) and it's amazing how well they sit on my nose and cheeks (I love the feeling when they nestle on my cheeks and I can feel their weight). Plus, they are really beautiful frames, amber acetate, in a very good state. </p><p> </p><p>I have a feeling that they don't have any cylinder as they don't feel too straining when I wear them with my -5 lenses. So I can't wait to get the matching lenses (-11, according to the maths I've done with the vertex distance and all that) to GOC with them. </p><p> </p><p>A couple of questions: should I worry about their pupilary distance (64) when mine is (68). Can that be a problem? </p><p> </p><p>Also, where can I get -11 contact lenses in either Spain or Europe?  </p><p> </p><p>Very excited.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2016, 07:43</p><p>gwgs, </p><p>All you should have to do is look through the area outside of he bowl and note if it appears to Magnify (Plus), Minify (Minus), or have no obvious optical characteristic (Plano). </p><p>Also, you may be able to look at the outside edge of the carrier where it meets the frame and compare it to the lens thickness at the edge of the bowl.

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2016, 01:47</p><p>Thanks for the input and detailed info CJ.

It's 57mm wide, with the bowl size being 40.2mm, this being the width from either side where the lens has been ground down. </p><p> </p><p>I don't have the other pair with me so can't measure them, but will do so when I next get a chance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2016, 11:40</p><p>gwgs, </p><p>The carrier is the type of lens outside of the "bowl" of the Myodisc (prescription part of the lens).  To make a Myodisc lens, the lens blank must be thick enough to allow the "bowl" to ground into the lens blank with enough remaining thickness of the lens material, to meet the lens strength requirements for safety.  </p><p>The common types of carrier are PLUS, MINUS, PLANO (flat), meaning the basic prescription of the lens blank.  In some cases, the edge of the bowl is sharp, but the edge can be rounded or "blended" into the carrier. </p><p>I don't have any experience with Myodisc lenses, but several members, who require very high minus prescriptions have indicated their preferences for the different types of carrier.   Perhaps they would be kind enough to comment. </p><p>BTW, I seem to recall a question about Bowl size, that is the diameter of the bowl in mm.  Generally, the higher the prescription the smaller the bowl diameter. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2016, 09:01</p><p>gwgs, </p><p>May I ask your age? </p><p>-15 glasses have almost 0.225 diopters per mm of VD effects and -13.75 have 0.189 diopters per mm.  Not much difference  There is also an interesting effect with high minus glasses.  They have very broad depth of field like Wide Angle Camera Lenses, which may have been helping you. </p><p>I had Cataract Surgery about 15 years ago, with Single Vision IOLs.  I have no accommodation and normally wear trifocals.  When I wear sa good GOC combo with -14 single vision glasses, I can read quite well at normal distances and also use the computer at about 1 meter.  If you have much accommodation available, you may be able to compensate for the small increase in the glasses prescription. </p><p>I suspect you are experiencing some mild motion sickness effects that will soon go away, though you might consider some non-drowsy OTC meds for temporary help.May I ask what type carrier the myodisc glasses have?

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2016, 07:06</p><p>Hi 30colcat - I presume bowl size refers to the size of the lens that you are looking through, i.e. the circular bit and not the part of the lens that has been polished down, is that correct? </p><p> </p><p>I've never measured it, but can do so next time I'm wearing them. I've just done approx 2 hours at a shopping centre wearing them and am back in the office now minus them (obviously!!). They're so comfortable and my vision is SO clear compared the regular index lenses that I have the same prescription for in another frame - the difference is truly remarkable and I cannot wait for my -15's to turn up which I ordered in a bigger but similar frame. </p><p> </p><p>I haven't had any comments unfortunately despite picking the checkouts in various shops where they are girls with glasses  and thought we could develop a conversation. I have found however that these clerks are lot more talkative generally than when I'm not wearing glasses! This is only the 3rd time I've worn them out so they're still relatively fresh. I have however noticed a few looks from passers by who look a lot closer at me than people normally do but I guess thats par for the course as they are very rare form of glasses that aren't seen every day</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2016, 14:08</p><p>Husqvarna, </p><p>Traditional glasses are much less expensive and easier to get than relatively low prescription myodiscs.  Learning to see well with high prescription GOC involves wearing a combination that gives you vision that is good enough for you to be able to function.  It is very likely, that you will make some mistakes with your first efforts unless you approach it systematically with accurate numbers and tools.  Many first time GOC experimenters wind up with combinations that seemed exciting to imagine, but were uncomfortable or impossible to wear.  Sometimes the experience is so uncomfortable that they decide abandon the project. </p><p>There is nothing really wrong with learning by trial and error.  A lot of research is done that way. My personal preference is to learn and make mistakes as inexpensively as possible.  You can experiment and learn inexpensively with traditional glasses from and on line retailer such as Zenni.  Then when you are satisfied with the results, go for higher prescriptions and better lenses. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2016, 20:23</p><p>Husqvarna, </p><p>You do not need anyone's permission to order Myodisc glasses from any online vendor that offers them, without having an official prescription.  Generally, you need a significantly higher prescription than -11 for myodisc lenses, but you might check with Optical4Less.   They used to have a special makings department that would do almost anything, within optical reason, but they were not inexpensive.  I don't know if they still offer that service or not.  It will help if you know how to write a glasses prescription and know your Pupillary Distance (PD) or how to measure it.  PD is a very important number to minimize distortion.  PD specifies the distance between the optical centers of the lenses in your glasses for the best vision with minimal distortion. </p><p>You also do not need to feel defensive about wanting to try wearing high minus glasses.  Many of us here have been there, done that, learned some "interesting" lessons about optics and vision.  Done "right" GOC and be a very enjoyable experience.  Several of us would be willing to share our knowledge and experience, but we won't force it on you.  Some people like to learn to swim by jumping into the deep end of the pool.

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2016, 15:39</p><p>I don't think myodisc lens blanks in the -12 range exist for an optician to make them, at least in the traditional design.  But I have had even -10 glasses in wide (53/19) frames come back from Zenni with noticeable blank on the edge, basically a large bowl (50mm) myodisc.  You might try Zenni and see what you get.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Husqvarna</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2016, 14:07</p><p>Why I should not try to wear myodisc?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2016, 12:59</p><p>For minus glasses I err on the side of having them a little too strong, for plus lenses just the opposite. For example, I used to wear -30 CLs under +20 glasses, with a little fudge based on my naturally slightly hyperopic eyes. For minus glasses, I think I wore +25 CLs under -40 glasses, or something close. The thing is you want them to focus if your glasses slip down a little. If you choose too small a vertex distance you might get great focus, but only when the glasses are right at the top of your nose and they don't move.  </p><p> </p><p>My first GOC I did the optics calculations myself, since there wasn't any internet to find an estimator and I didn't know any of you guys out there. I found with that first pair it was really challenging to keep the glasses exactly in the right place, which always seemed too far up the nose. </p><p> </p><p>S4E, yes, I do remember those thick geeker glasses! They were cool. I was once stopped wearing +20 really thick glasses, but surprisingly the cop said nothing about them. It wasn't for any traffic violation, and in fact I was parked. Not sure what it was about, actually, as he didn't even check my driver's license. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2016, 12:19</p><p>My prescription is -18 and I always find wearing a cap much easier on my eyes as helping to focus opossed to wearing my clear glasses without,vision much sharper wearing 80% tinted lenses </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2016, 06:27</p><p>Husquvarna, if good vision means no refractive errors then it is fairly likely that at your age you can wear -12D glasses with + 10D contact lenses.  But to get to the point where you would be able to wear myodiscs you will likely need to wear -20D glasses or above.  To wear -22D glasses you would then need +17.00D contact lenses.  Of course all this is subjective and depends on your being able to wear the glasses at a point that is 13.5 mm from your cornea - a measurement that is pretty near impossile to do on your own without specialized instruments.  Personally I found +17D contact lenses would work for slightly over -25D and that lead me not to trust the calculations.  I had a good selection of plus contacts in different powers, so if I bought a pair of glasses to wear wih a specific power of contacts and I found out that the calculations were out I could always switch to a lower - or higher power of contacts. But this is very costly. And for -20D glasses the calculations show +15.75D contacts are the proper ones, but again all this is subject to the persons adaptability.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2016, 20:08</p><p>Husquvarna, you will have to give us more information such as your own prescription and your age. Using the calculations a -10D cl should give you a prescription of 11.56D for glasses at a vertex distance of 13.5mm. The bigger the vertex distance the more power you can accept, A 13.0 vertex distance gives you just under 11.50D, but a vertex distance of 15mm gives you a prescription of 11.75D. If you are younger than 45 you shoudl be able to focus through a much stronger lens than if you are in the 50 or over age group.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2016, 19:57</p><p>There is no hard and fast rule about the strength of a prescription in either Canada or the USA Maxim. The main thing they are concerned about is that you have a visual acuity of better than 20/40. I generally won't try driving with GOC unless I can attain that or better.  But having said that I was pretty adept at getting the glasses off and the contact lenses out long before a police officer could make it from behind the trailer up to the door of the cab. I always filled my lens case with clean solution before I started driving and kept it and my glasses case close at hand. </p><p>The only time I thought I might have a problem was late one night in Arkansas when an eastbound car came across the median and bounced off the side of my truck, ending up almost under my trailer.  I was wearing a pair of really thick -30 myodiscs at the time(and they were thick - just ask NJ because I lent him these glasses at one time) Fortunately I had another pair with the same prescription that were superlenti glass myodiscs and I handled everything while wearing those glasses. The officer never even questioned me. Fortunately no one was hurt, and the cars insurance company handled the damage to my truck. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2016, 10:07</p><p>Maxim, the requirements to drive vary state by state here in the US. Where I live, we are only checked for visual acuity. There is no test for peripheral vision, which is good for extreme hyperopes but not so good for those who share the road with them.  </p><p> </p><p>And regarding the adjustment period, there are literally millions of people who have gone from wearing low scripts or just reading glasses, to very high plus glasses. In the days before IOLs were used, every cataract patient experienced this. And it was worse than doing GOC because they had no option to take out their contact lenses, they needed to wear their glasses all the time to see. It's interesting to read the old literature on this, as the advice is similar to what you're getting here. Just take it slow and start with familiar places. Most post-cataract patients in the old days eventually adjusted. And the adjustment to high plus glasses is much more difficult that to high minus glasses. </p><p> </p><p>It will work out for you, but don't start driving too soon! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2016, 09:53</p><p>Isn't there a certain conflict with rules and legislation in your country, with e.g. a -45.00 diopter GOC? </p><p> </p><p>I have looked through the regulations in our place: </p><p> </p><p>1) Hyperopia cannot be corrected for driving with glasses more than +8.00 (I think that refers to the vision field).

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2016, 07:51</p><p>rafa, </p><p>Just a reminder.  Vision actually occurs in the brain.  The eyes are merely biological cameras.  The brain is perfectly capable of correcting images and even producing images with no input from your eyes.  When your brain is first confronted with significantly different images, as it is when doing high prescription GOC, It has to learn how to deal with those images.  The mental programing process seems to occur mostly when you are sleeping, which tends to explain why you have problems doing something very well one day and the next day, you can do it easily.   </p><p>It also seems that once your brain figures out how to deal with the image distortion with the -9.00 combo, it will have much less trouble dealing with the images with a higher prescription combo.  It will also be able to switch between different combos very quickly. </p><p>Hopefully, you will experience something similar to what S4E experienced when he had no problem driving with extremely strong GOC combos.  Also, the way natural high myopes are able to switch between glasses and contact lenses with only minor, brief difficulties. </p><p>Please continue to keep us posted on your experiences.  It will help others, who are new to GOC, know what to expect and understand the process better.  You are getting some excellent advice from those who have gone before.  It may not be fully applicable because everyone is different.  It is way better than blundering into GOC, having a horrible experience, and abandoning GOC entirely, as some have done. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2016, 06:51</p><p>As I suggested to Rafa yesterday Maxim, the more you wear GOC the easier it is for you to adjust to wearing it.  And as far as driving wearing GOC, I have driven well over 200,000Km  while doing GOC for 3 and 4 days in a row in a tractor trailer.  When I first started to do GOC while driving my choice of prescription was -17.50 with the appropriate contacts, but often this would not satisfy me and I would wear whatever I felt like for as many kilometers as I could drive that day wearing a prescription as high as -46D.   </p><p>You do have to be careful about the minification, and some of my very strong glasses were not suitable to wear while driving because of the reflections thrown into the lens from behind. The -46D glasses I could wear behind the wheel were blended myodiscs. I had a second pair in the same prescription that were biconcave myodiscs with a very steep plus carrier and the plus carrier would pick up reflections from behind me and would cast them into the lens. </p><p>I never had a problem when driving, but long before I ever tried to drive wearing GOC I spent many hours doing GOC.  At first I would put my GOC in just after leaving the house in the morning and then I would drive to work - about an hour away.  And I would stop on the way to go in for coffee. I had one place I stopped when wearing my -17.50D combination, and another place I stopped wearing my -30D blended myodiscs. The really great days were days I had to drive for 1.5 hours to reach a larger city and I would savour the drive for as long as I could. </p><p>Not everyone reacts the same way.  But you will know when you are safe enough to wear GOC behind the wheel.  This only comes after doing it for a long time, and I honestly think that switching between different GOC prescriptions helps quite a lot.  One day you will not notice the doorways being bowed. You will not feel anything when you put the GOC glasses on over your appropriate contacts. It will just feel like a normal occurrence. I have always had a glasses restriction on my license, and for the ability to do GOC I will never have it removed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2016, 05:49</p><p>It has been considerably better on my second day of GOC. But I only stayed in the house, I didn't venture to go out. I GOC'd around the house for about an hour. The good thing is that there was no feeling of dizziness this time around, or at least a very slight one, as the walls still appear a little curved and the floor more distant than normal. </p><p> </p><p>So I'm more confident that I'll be able to tame the images on my brain with these -9's without having to downgrade! </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>gwgs </p><p> </p><p>I did get very big frames, in fact, for anyone who likes big frames, I do recommend these 237417 Zenni frames that I got.

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2016, 00:48</p><p>I wouldn't advise driving when GOC'ing or operating any machinery as this could result in dire consequences! </p><p> </p><p>Rafa - I can relate partially to what you're saying here, as I've found negotiating stairs, edge of pavements etc a lot different when GOC'ing as the different levels aren't where you think they are, and I've found one way of making this problem easier is by wearing bigger frames, as with the smaller frames, your distorted / uncorrected vision is much greater when you look up / down / side to side but with bigger frames and therefore bigger lenses your peripheral vision is far greater, but it still takes time to get to know how not to make a fool of yourself in public walking up stairs (I tend to try to get the lift when applicable!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2016, 15:40</p><p>PS.: There is a problem when walking respectively driving, and that lasts longer (forever?): </p><p> </p><p>Everything seems smaller and further away. with my -8.00 that might be an estimated an estimated 30 percent. </p><p> </p><p>I have ALWAYS be aware of that, e.g. a bus or truck in the street, or overtaking an agricultural vehicle,  you think, it is still 100 meters/ 300 feet away, but it's only 60 meters / 200 feet. That's a real danger with GOC experiments.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2016, 14:51</p><p>Thanks everyone for your comments and tips. I really appreciate them. </p><p> </p><p>I think that motion sickness, as Cactus Jack said, might be the cause, as the feeling I had was similar to what you feel when you're on the deck of a ship in a rough sea and you lose the stability of the horizon. That coupled with the fish bowl effect of the strong lenses, when walls become curved. Is that what myodiscs, gwgs, spare you from as opposed to high index lenses? </p><p> </p><p>But I'm very encouraged to hear that from your experience I will get used to GOC'ing with these strong glasses sooner than I think. </p><p> </p><p>I will keep you posted with my progress!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2016, 13:52</p><p>Rafa, FWIW I started my GOC adventures with a script more than twice that of yours. It took about a week to acclimate, and I worked up to it slowly, first in familial places and then out in public. But I did get used to the different perspective and it's not been a problem since. </p><p> </p><p>CJ, I don't think relative motion per se is the issue so much as the lack of a stable horizon line or similar reference. Our brains are constantly monitoring our position via various senses, including vision and the semicircular canals among others. Motion sickness tends to occur when there's no stable horizon line or other visual reference to calibrate the ear with vision. Wearing an unfamiliar and strong script causes all references to move when the brain is not expecting them to, thus confusing it.  </p><p> </p><p>IIRC, it's believed that the actual sickness is an evolutionary artifact based on the ototoxicity of some naturally occurring toxins. The disruption of the semicircular canals, as confirmed by corroborating visual references, results in the person throwing up, which is a good response if that person has ingested a toxin. I don't know if this is true, but I do remember reading about it back in med school.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2016, 13:42</p><p> </p><p>To rafa: </p><p>as many others here, I can confirm these problems. I did +8.00 myopization as a maximum, but when I started, I really took them off after 10 or 15 minutes only. After six or seven days, everything was fine, and now I can wear +8.00 lenses with the corresponding glasses on 20 hour travels without problems.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2016, 12:31</p><p>rafa, </p><p>What you may experiencing with your -9 glasses are the symptoms of motion sickness.  One of the things that happens with higher prescriptions is a change in apparent relative motion as you move your head or eyes.  High minus lenses have slower relative motion and high plus lenses have faster relative motion.   </p><p>The difference in what your semi-circular canals sense and what you see is one of the major causes of the symptoms of motion sickness.  You can overcome these symptoms by wearing your -9 glasses as much as possible.  You might try some over-the-counter motion sickness pills or other remedies and see if that helps you control the symptoms and speed your getting comfortable with the higher prescription glasses. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2016, 11:38</p><p>Thanks rafa for sharing your experiences, and welcome to the world of strong lenses!  You will get more adaptable to switching between glasses and I hope you continue to enjoy it more.   </p><p> </p><p>What you experienced is actually something that happens to many of us who wear strong lenses for natural corrrection (not GOC).  There are many myopes these days in the -6, -7, and higher ranges who got into contacts at some early age and wear them all day, from the time they get up until the time they go to sleep.  These people rely completely on contacts and will go weeks and maybe months without wearing glasses.  People do this despite doctors' advice to give the eyes a break, or some doctors may not advise it at all.  But for these people, one day, a crisis disrupts this pattern, like an eye infection, and she has to switch to glasses.  You can see how the dizziness and other drastic changes can cause her to feel very grumpy about her eyes.   </p><p> </p><p>Even more interesting is that there are high myopes who have been used to wearing glasses for a long time and can't tolerate going the other direction, finding wearing contacts too disorienting.  When I was a teenager I switched back to wearing glasses all the time.  On the rare occasion that I would try wearing contacts, I found that I had lost my ability to accomodate to the change and the whole contacts experience became miserable.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2016, 06:38</p><p>Rafa, it's not necessarily that your first GOC glasses are too strong, you're just wearing them to do more difficult tasks. Just take your time, wear them around the house for a few days, then go outside for short walks, and work up from there. You'll be surprised how your brain adapts to the different visual experience. In no time you won't even notice the difference in your visions with GOG and your regular script.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2016, 06:34</p><p>Rafa, over the eyars my brain has learned to process the changes between different prescriptions and I no longer ever seem to experience the dizzy feeling. I used to love that part of it.  The more you use your new GOC combination the sooner you will get used to it.  And while CJ is correct about not starting off with too high a combination, it can get terribly expensive doing it that way. Better to wear the combinations around your own place for a while unril your brain adapts to it.  Good Luck</p><p></p><hr>

I have two pairs which have regular index lenses, and one pair which has myodiscs. This was an interesting experiment and experience for me as I although I've worn them before, I had only done so for 2-3 hours where as this weekend I wore them for probably half of Saturday, and the majority of Sunday. I found my vision with the myodiscs SO much better and clearer and lighter for that fact than the glasses with regular index lenses in. The peripheral vision, and clarity was exceptional and although my vision was good and perfectly fine in the other two pairs. </p><p> </p><p>I would highly recommend myodiscs to ANYONE who is GOC'ing at this level as they were exceptional. One probably wouldn't normally associate myodiscs at this sort of prescription, but I can see why they were invented as the peripheral vision, and weight of the lenses was far different to that of my other glasses. They were so good in fact, I've ordered a pair of -15's in a slightly bigger frame with myodisc lenses - can't wait to try this out!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DS</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2016, 20:24</p><p>Soyuz, </p><p> </p><p>Re the higher cyl, without a true refraction it's a close call.  It is mathematically correct as sphere and (sphere+cyl) powers should be corrected for vertex distance independently. However, how the contact lens interacts with your cornea is an unknown.  The higher power contact lens could behave somewhat like a rigid lens and allow a refractive tear film that partially corrects or otherwise changes the astigmatism correction required in the glasses. </p><p> </p><p>You could split the middle with the right eye and it wouldn't really make much difference.  A quarter-diopter cyl in the glasses isn't worth as much at these powers. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soyuz</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2016, 03:22</p><p>Thank you DS for your answer, too. Do you think it is not a problem involving a hogher cylinder prescription?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DS</b>&nbsp;30 May 2016, 15:13</p><p>Soyuz, </p><p> </p><p>-17D aligns very well with the +0.25D of your right eye with a +14.50 lens on it.  Do you have your astigmatism correction in the glasses, or are they -17.00 SPH? </p><p> </p><p>If you don't have the cylinder in the glasses, then the astigmatism is probably what is causing any less-than-ideal vision with your current combo.  Then also, off-axis vision in high-power lenses is also distorted.  You will only get the best vision while looking through the optical centers of the lenses. </p><p> </p><p>For +15 contacts, I would start with the following glasses: </p><p>OD -18.00 -1.50 x 177 </p><p>OS -18.25 -0.75 x 180 </p><p> </p><p>(Note: I increased the vertex distance a little bit for doing my calculations.  10mm seems like a close fit.) </p><p> </p><p>And as Cactus Jack indicates, your age allows you to give an extra -0.25 or -0.50 on the sphere.  My experience, however, is that the aspheric designs of the modern high plus lenses makes this extra correction unnecessary.  I always feel a bit overcorrected going with exact optical formulas that assume "perfect power profiles" in the contacts and glasses.  Yet if there is some desire to overcorrect to maximize the power of the glasses, then you should handle it fine. </p><p> </p><p>Biofinity XR lenses go to +15.00.  You may want to see if these might work better for you than the Proclear.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 May 2016, 02:17</p><p>Soyuz </p><p>Here are the calculations for GOC wearing +15 Contact lenses with your prescription of: </p><p>OD Sphere +0.25, Cylinder -1.00 axis 177 </p><p>OS Sphere 0.00, Cylinder -0.50 axis 180 </p><p>Sphere Eye Power (reverse of prescription with Contacts </p><p>OD  -0.25 +15.00 = +14.75 </p><p>OS    0.00 +15.00 = +15.00 </p><p>Because the square function is involved, I use successive iteration of the glasses prescription to determine the glasses Sphere power @ 10 mm that will have the desired effective power at the cornea to neutralize the Eye Power.  I have done this enough to be able to hit it pretty close on the first try. </p><p>OD Glasses Sphere = -18.00 </p><p>-18.00 x -18.00 = 324.00  divide by 1000 = 0.324 diopters per mm x 10 mm = 3.24 difference at the cornea. </p><p>3.24 - 18.00 = -14.76 excellent </p><p>OS Glasses Sphere = -18.25 </p><p>-18.25 x -18.25 = 333.06 divide by 1000 = 0.333 diopters per mm x 10 mm = 3.33 difference at the cornea </p><p>3.33 -18.25 = -14.92 close, but lets try -18.50 </p><p>OS Glasses Sphere = -18.50 </p><p>-18.50 x -18.50 = 342.25 divide by 1000 = 0.342 diopters per mm x 10 mm = 3.42 difference at the cornea </p><p>3.42 -18.50 = -15.08 excellent </p><p>Calculated Glasses Prescription </p><p>OD Sphere -18.00, Cylinder -1.00 Axis 177 </p><p>OS Sphere -18.50, Cylinder -0.50 Axis 180 </p><p>Because you probably have plenty of accommodation at 32, I would suggest increasing the sphere in both lenses by -0.50 so your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses can fine tune the sharpness with a bit more plus.  If it turns out that the Vertex Distance is more that 10 mm you may need a bit more MINUS in the glasses. </p><p>Please understand that there are no guarantees and at these Sphere powers, Vertex Distance has a powerful influence. </p><p>Please let me know how this works for you. </p><p>Contact Lens Care for GOC </p><p>Because of Dry Eye problems, I dont do GOC very often, but when I do, this is what I do. </p><p>Before handling your Contact Lenses, I suggest that you wash your hands throughly with a bit of Baby Shampoo instead of regular soap or hand wash.  Baby Shampoo is pH balanced to not sting if it gets in your eyes.  Rinse your hands throughly and dry with a clean towel. </p><p>I use an Anti-Bacterial Foaming Hand Wash for normal hand washing, but the hand wash will sting if it gets in your eyes and really irritate them if it gets on the contact lenses.  I saved an empty dispenser and washed it throughly.  I then mixed 50% Baby Shampoo and 50% water to thin the Baby Shampoo to the approximate thinness of the Foaming Hand Wash liquid.  It works great. </p><p>I also use Alcon Opti-Free Pure Moist or Baush and Lomb BioTrue for cleaning, rinsing, and storing the lenses.  Before inserting the lenses I use a few drops of the above directly in the eye or some lubricating Artificial Tears to provide extra moisture and lubrication. </p><p>I dont produce enough tears, so I use Lubricating Eye Drops containing Carboxmethylcellulose Sodium 0.5% through out the day. </p><p>If you live in a location that has Low Humidity, you may find the above useful in keeping your Contact Lenses lubricated, moist and comfortable. </p><p>Let me know if there is anything you do not understand. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soyuz</b>&nbsp;29 May 2016, 18:13</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p> </p><p>Thank you very much for quick answers. I'm higher educated but not in "vision and health" field. </p><p> </p><p>I guess I do not really want to go higher and higher, better to stay at the level I mentioned earlier. I just tried before the combination (+14,5 contacts and -17,00 glasses) and it was working quite fine but later I could realise it could be better and clearer if I would use glasses with prescription according to my eye condition. My right eye is weaker then my left, I would need a different dioptria. </p><p>I would like to use the +15,00 contacts (not more) for both eyes, vertex distance 10 mm, my eye condition find below post. What do you recommend of prescription glasses to order for my eyes with a little astigmatism? Thank you very much, S. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;29 May 2016, 17:44</p><p>Soyuz, </p><p>Only one post that time.   </p><p>Vertex Distance is the distance from the front of the Cornea to the back of the glasses lens.  It is typically not recorded on a prescription unless the prescription is very high where it could be significant.  For your "official" prescription Vertex Distance is trivial and does not need to be considered. Vertex Distance is typically between 10 and 12 mm.  I generally use 12 mm for my calculations.  The problem is that there is no way to tell what the Vertex Distance of the glasses will be, until you get them.  Wearers of high prescription glasses experience a significant effective power change with changes in Vertex Distance.  For MINUS glasses, moving the glasses closer to the eye increases their effective power.  Moving them away decreases their effective power.   </p><p>One of the reasons I suggest finding a "friendly" Eye Care Professional for high prescription GOC is that they can do a refraction with the Contact Lenses in place and use Vertex Distance as a consideration in prescribing glasses.  Also, because Astigmatism is typically caused by uneven curvature of the cornea, high PLUS soft contacts can change the effective Cylinder and Axis some. </p><p>I would like to suggest that initially, we work with the -14.5 contacts you already have. I think I can offer some suggestions to make them more comfortable to wear and give you better vision with some different glasses. </p><p>I don't think you have mentioned where you live.  The only reason I would like to know is to get a better idea of what products are available there.  +15.00 contacts will not give you much of an increase over the +14.50 contacts. </p><p>Does this sound interesting to you or do you want to try to get some -20.00 glasses and contact lenses to go with them.  The potential for buying an unwearable combination, increases exponentially with an increase in the glasses prescription. </p><p>May I also ask your educational background and occupation? </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;29 May 2016, 14:09</p><p>Soyuz, </p><p>It would be very helpful to know your age.  The older a person is, the more careful you have to be with the prescriptions.  Younger people can easily compensate for small amounts of under correction in the Contact Lenses.  Older people have limited accommodation and they cannot compensate very much. </p><p>You also need to understand that GOC is a very inexact science and there are no guarantees that the calculations at high prescriptions will be accurate.  As I have mentioned before, Vertex Distance effects are HUGE with glasses prescriptions above about 15. </p><p>At this time, I don't have a good source of high + contact lenses. </p><p>I notice that you are getting double posts.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;28 May 2016, 20:01</p><p>Soyuz, </p><p>I don't trust the GOC calculation table at high prescriptions.  The Vertex Distance effects become very great at high prescriptions and the table is not bad if you know the Vertex Distance.  The problem is that Vertex Distance is very hard to measure accurately and a small error can make a BIG difference in your vision with GOC. </p><p>You really should not start doing GOC at very high prescriptions, unless you can find a friendly Eye Care Professional to help you.   </p><p>Obviously, there is a problem with your contacts or your eyes would not get Red.  Incorrectly fitted or improperly cared for Contact Lenses are quite frankly, dangerous.  Your Corneas have no blood supply. they must get their oxygen and nutrients from tears and from the air.  Contact lenses are supposed to float on a tear film and tears need to circulate freely under them.  Some contact lenses are high moisture and are designed to be Oxygen permeable to keep the Corneas moist and well supplied with Oxygen. </p><p>We have an expression here that refers to people who approach problems like a "Bull in a China Shop".  My experience with helping people do satisfying and effective GOC is to avoid people who are not good listeners and followers of instructions or suggestions.  Extreme aggressiveness in doing GOC, usually wastes a lot of money and is not a very pleasant experience which is often abandoned. </p><p>One reason to start low and slow is to allow your brain to learn to SEE with very strong glasses.  Remember that most people who become naturally very Myopic, became that way over a period of many years.  You can do it much faster than that, but experience has shown that it is not wise to go suddenly from almost no refractive error to a very significant refractive error. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;18 May 2016, 14:14</p><p>Id like to share with everyone here how exciting it has been for me to come across Eyescene. </p><p> </p><p>Im 48 and a glasses fetishist/lover and I have been keeping it under wraps since my teenage years. I always had this feeling that I was some kind of weirdo, that there was something wrong with me, as there clearly was a sexual element involved, and thats why I have been unable to share my passion for glasses with anyone. </p><p> </p><p>Over the years Ive been trying to find ways of detecting if there were other people like me, particularly women, as I have always loved GWGs and my dream was to find one who would share my passion. And so I was always very alert to any signs from other people that would betray their love for glasses. I wonder if anyone in this forum has also developed a sixth sense for detecting other potential glasses fetishists. I would love to hear your stories about it. So I would immediately pick up on those signs, like people wearing sunglasses even when its dark, people who like try on other peoples prescriptions glasses and keep them on for a bit, people who would always make comments on my glasses or who would glance more at me when I would wear them than when I wear CLs, people who like to continuously emphasize how blind they are despite being only very mildly myopic, people who would start using reading glasses far too early on in their lives, or simply people who would change their frames or sunglasses very often. I have all my life been alert to those signs hoping to find a twin soul. </p><p> </p><p>Ive had many relationships in my life and I have never been able to tell my partner what glasses really did for me. And so its been a bit of a lonely voyage of self-discovery in that respect. </p><p> </p><p>There was one time when I was 17 that I came across a twenty-one year old girl who showed clear signs of being a glasses fetishist. We were on a trip to the US (from Spain) along with many other young students who were going to spend a month in San Francisco to learn English. She was wearing some very large prescription glasses on what seemed to be sunglasses frames. Clear lenses. I thought she was incredibly attractive. She was probably in the region of minus 3. But of course, she wouldnt notice me, because I was 4 years her junior. At that time, I would seldom use glasses, because my prescription was very mild and it didnt seem cool. I chatted her up several times, and we became friends. But it was obvious she wasnt interested in me. She thought I was kind of sweet, but I was too young for her. Until one day when we went with some friends to a rock concert and I had to wear my glasses to see properly. She suddenly was around me all the time, giving me so much attention. I couldnt believe it. </p><p> </p><p>After the concert, she and I shared a car ride with other friends and we sat together in the back seat of the car. I wasnt wearing my glasses then, but she couldnt stop giving me all her attention and smiles. She was all over me. And then she concocted an excuse to start tickling me until she found what she was really looking for: my glasses in my inside pocket. Of course she pulled them out and tried them on and wore them for a bit, made comments on my prescription, hers, etc. And thats when she finally got satisfied. I would have sworn that she was a glasses fetishist herself. But I could never dare to ask her. </p><p> </p><p>It just happened that by that time since she hadnt been interested in me at all before I wore my glasses- that I had started a relationship a successful one- with another girl, and so I let this girl, this great opportunity, pass me by. She was clearly still interested in me and tried to hit on me several times. But I was with another girl and soon enough the month in the US got to an end. </p><p> </p><p>Months later, back in Spain, I realized my mistake, and I tried to get in contact with her, but couldnt find her anyway, since we didnt exchange numbers or addresses nor did we have common friends. </p><p> </p><p>Ive never forgotten her. Because she could have been THE one. </p><p> </p><p>Now Im about to become a GOC wearer and Im incredibly excited about it . And also very excited to be able to share my feelings and experiences with other glasses lovers. Ive been reading treads of years and years of posts on Eyescene, particularly those of GOCs, and its been a great experience. And got really excited when I read Marks post of 29 October 2015 about finding a mildly myopic girl in the supermarket, while he was doing GOC, who kept glancing at him and eventually wanted to try on his glasses.

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;14 May 2016, 09:13</p><p>Thank you so much, Cactusjack, for your calculations and your advice. I can't wait to do it, to see the power rings on my glasses. I will let you know how it goes! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;13 May 2016, 18:20</p><p>rafa, </p><p>I would suggest that you consider starting with a GOC combination that provides an approximate -3 increase over your regular prescription and once you are comfortable wearing those, go for the -6 increase. </p><p>Here are the calculations for the -3 increase or -6 glasses.  You are very fortunate that your prescription is nearly identical in both eyes. </p><p> Desired glasses prescription: </p><p>   OD (Right Eye) Sphere -6.00,  Cylinder -0.75 x Axis 10 </p><p>   OS (Left Eye)Sphere -6.00,  Cylinder -0.75 x Axis 20 </p><p>Vertex Distance Effect of -6.00 glasses @ 12 mm, typical Vertex Distance </p><p>     6.00 x 6.00 = 36   36 / 1000 = 0.036    0.036 x 12 = 0.432 </p><p>Vertex distance effects reduce the effective power of your glasses as you get closer to the Cornea so the power of -6.00 Sphere is: </p><p>    -6.00 - (+ 0.432) = -5.568   </p><p>With -2.75 correction with glasses the Vertex Distance Effect of your glasses is only 0.090 which can be ignored. </p><p>Remember that corrective lenses are the opposite sign of your actual refractive error.  In your case, +2.75.  To effectively wear the -6.00 glasses you will need +5.568 of refractive error: </p><p>     +5.568 -(+2.75) = +2.81 contacts.  Unfortunately, that power is not available.  The question is, which would be better +2.75 or +3.00.  I would suggest +2.75 contacts because you still have a bit of accommodation available to supply the tiny amount of additional PLUS you need. </p><p>For this GOC combination, I would suggest: </p><p>A Sphere Only Contact lenses of +2.75 with the same Brand, Diameter and Base Curve you a presently wearing and Glasses Prescription; </p><p>   OD -6.00, -0.75 x 10, Add +2.00 </p><p>   OS -6.00, -0.75 x 20, Add +2.00 </p><p>For -9.00 glasses I would suggest the following: </p><p> </p><p> Desired glasses prescription: </p><p>   OD (Right Eye) Sphere -9.00,  Cylinder -0.75 x Axis 10, Add +2.00 </p><p>   OS (Left Eye)Sphere -9.00,  Cylinder -0.75 x Axis 20, Add +2.00 </p><p>Vertex Distance Effect of -9.00 glasses @ 12 mm, typical Vertex Distance </p><p>     9.00 x 9.00 = 81   81 / 1000 = 0.081    0.081 x 12 = 0.972 </p><p>Vertex distance effects reduce the effective power of your glasses as you get closer to the Cornea so the power of -9.00 Sphere is: </p><p>    -9.00 - (+ 0.972) = -8.028   </p><p>With -2.75 correction with glasses the Vertex Distance Effect of your glasses is only 0.090 which can be ignored as before. </p><p>Remember that corrective lenses are the opposite sign of your actual refractive error.  In your case, +2.75.  To wear the -9.00 glasses you will need +8.028 of refractive error: </p><p>     +8.028 -(+2.75) = +5.278 contacts.  Unfortunately, that power is not available.  The question is, which would be better +5.25 or +5.00.  I would suggest +5.25 contacts, but you might want to consider +5.00 if you have enough accommodation available to supply the small amount of additional PLUS you need. </p><p>For this GOC combination, I would suggest: </p><p>A Sphere Only Contact lenses of +5.25 with the same Brand, Diameter and Base Curve you a presently wearing and Glasses Prescription; </p><p>   OD -9.00, -0.75 x 10, Add +2.00 </p><p>   OS -9.00, -0.75 x 20, Add +2.00 </p><p>Please remember that GOC is NOT an exact science and the suggestions are only offered as advisory.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;13 May 2016, 07:06</p><p>rafa, </p><p>GOC is NOT something you just do.  It takes some planning and an understanding of optics and vision to do it well. </p><p>We generally suggest using Sphere ONLY + or - contacts, depending on what you want your glasses prescription to be.  However, you SHOULD NOT just order Contacts and hope for the best.  That is a good way to throw money away. </p><p>There are a few hard and fast rules for successful GOC. </p><p>1. DO NOT try to go too high, too fast.  Vision occurs in the brain and your brain has to learn how to process the new images. </p><p>2. DO NOT buy high prescription glasses from any source that were made for someone else, with the hope of correcting any optical problems with contacts. It usually does not work. </p><p>3. If you are not familiar with caring for contact lenses, get an exam and instruction in insertion, removal, and care of contact lenses.  Poor Hygiene and incorrect Base Curve can cause permanent Cornea Damage even with soft contacts. </p><p>4. Use Sphere ONLY contact lenses.  If you need Astigmatism correction, transfer the Cylinder and Axis EXACTLY into the GOC glasses.  Very high PLUS soft contact lenses can change the amount of Cylinder and Axis you need, but it is rare. </p><p>5. If the Glasses prescription is above +/- 4.00, you need to consider Vertex Distance effects in your GOC calculations. </p><p>6. GOC is NOT an exact science.  Expect to have to make some adjustments and be pleasantly surprised if you get it right the first time. </p><p>It would be helpful if you could provide the following information. </p><p>1. Your Age? </p><p>2. Your Occupation? </p><p>3. Where you live? </p><p>4. Your most recent COMPLETE glasses prescription </p><p>5.

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;13 May 2016, 03:19</p><p>Hi there. I want to start using glasses over contacts so I can dramatically increase my diopters on my minus glasses. </p><p> </p><p>And I have a few basic questions: </p><p> </p><p>Are the standard + contact lenses you get from any online retailers for hyperopia the same as the one for presbiopia that I would need to counter my myopia? In other words, are hyperopia contact lenses the same as presbiopia contact lenses? My usual retailers dispatch as strong as +6 contact lenses. And that would be good enough for me, so I could get -9 glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Second: in order to order some new glasses, if I increase the myopia of my rx from -3 to -9, should I keep the same astigmatism rx? In other words, does the change in myopia affect the astigmatism rx? </p><p> </p><p>I'd be very grateful if someone could help me with this. </p><p> </p><p>I'm really excited to become a GOC wearer.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;06 May 2016, 04:49</p><p>tom1;  I think your goal to experience the effect of a higher degree of nearsightedness could be accomplished by adding reading glasses over your uncorreced eyes.  I think you could effectively double the impact of your I uncorrected vision by trying some  plus 4 Readers.  Fortunately you can pick up readers quite in expensively, even at the dollar stores.  Some  of us have enjoyed your past posts about trying to function bare eyed for a period of time.  I used to do such myself.  Let us know of your experience with the readers if you decide to try.  thanks, Greg.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;06 May 2016, 00:01</p><p>As you (may) have understood my obsession is for poor vision itself more than glasses. This is why I love seeing people going around bareeyed with poor vision more than bespectacled ones.

I mean, if I put a, say, +2 pair of reading glasses over my naked eyes, should I see as if I was -5 and -7? Or there is some more complicated math to do?  </p><p> </p><p>I'd love to experience higher degree of uncorrected nearsightedness than I actually have and over the counter reading glasses would be a very cheap and easy option (much more than plus contacts)... </p><p> </p><p>P.S. anyone tried experiments like this before?

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;04 May 2016, 17:03</p><p>Adriadne - I am naturally nearsighted and wear -16.25 glasses to get about 20/30 vision.  My first glasses as a child were just -2.  As my lenses increased in strength, I certainly experienced the increase in distortion of the world.  More specifically, people take one look at you and your strong glasses and make judgments about what you can and can't do, such as sports, arts, and things that require "good vision".  We are told we can't look attractive with glasses.  These judgments are not cool, and are flat out wrong.  Most people cave to this discrimination and get contacts or laser, which I think makes things much worse for people who can't or choose not to wear contacts.   </p><p> </p><p>I refuse to live in a world that believes that there is a common "perfect" standard that some people meet and some people don't and it's just too bad for those who don't.  I thrive on embracing the things that make me different, and proving that those differences don't make me a lesser person, but a better person.  I intentionally engaged in activities that require "good vision" wearing my thick glasses and succeeded at winning competitions, proving that wearing glasses does not fundamentally handicap you from achieving anything that you want to set out to achieve.  I suppose for me, everything that is worth doing is worth over-doing.  At one point, when I was still only wearing -10 glasses, there was so much positive energy and self-confidence in this way of life that I dived into GOC, seeing if I could get even more by wearing even stronger glasses.  I suppose it is not much different from someone who has red hair, lives in such a way that their personality thrives on it, and then artificially colours their hair even more red to get more energy from the effect.   </p><p> </p><p>Like I said in the beginning, I now wear -16.25 glasses without contacts, and I don't wear contacts anymore.  But I support the efforts of those who are engaged in GOC.  It is an uphill battle against mainstream culture, so I appreciate ever person who is working against common judgments on people who wear thick glasses, whether it be through GOC or more natural means.  And I hope that in the journey, we can embrace how glasses enhance your life, get "high" on positive energy and self-confidence, and that our paths cross one day and we can exchange stories.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;04 May 2016, 06:56</p><p>Adriane, I don't suppose I can explain myself to you in such a way that you can understand.  Ever since I was very young I have been fascinated by glasses wearers - particularly those who wore strong minus glasses. I wanted to wear glasses and I did my best when I was younger to try to make my dream come true. I even tried to induce a decent amount of myopia, however I was in my late 30's when I started this, and while I did get myself up to a -10.25D and -8.00D prescription as soon as I reached my late 40's it all fell apart and within about a 5 year period my eyes went back to where they were before I tried to induce myopia. Then I discovered GOC. </p><p>Again you will not understand. I do not care if I fool anyone. I do not even care if people look at me and think that that old gray haired guy wears really strong glasses. I just feel at home with myself when I am out in public wearing very strong minus glasses.  Yes, sometimes I do have a chance to converse with other people who wear strong minus glasses, and the fact that my glasses are extremely strong does help put them at ease.  But I am as much at home wearing my glasses in my house as I am out in public. I just feel like this is the way I should have been naturally. </p><p>Again, to someone who has had to wear strong glasses all their life this cannot easily be understood. You have wanted nothing more than to be glasses free.  Those of us who do GOC would love to be able to trade your vision for ours.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;04 May 2016, 02:37</p><p>Ariadne - I have taken done GOC quite a few times, and hopefully others will post their views on why they like it. </p><p> </p><p>For me, it is about experiencing what I find a turn on in women, and that is wearing big strong glasses. Yes I like ladies without glasses, and yes I like ladies who wear glasses with weak prescriptions dependant on their choice of frame, but to be able to get the feeling of being highly myopic is a real buzz. I have three different combos for doing GOC with two of the stronger combinations involving -10 glasses, and -13/-13.5 glasses. I have noticed ladies at checkouts / in stores are much more talkative and friendly when I'm GOC'ing than when I'm not  (bizarre!!). </p><p> </p><p>I feel an almost sense of panic when I've just put the contacts in and I haven't put the glasses on yet as you can imagine, my vision is now very blurry without glasses and I can't see anything clearly / in focus beyond my hand. Once I've got the glasses on there is a sense of warmth and comfort that I can see clearly once again and am dependant on them. I have had a lady ask once before who was a glasses wearer herself if is she could try my glasses on as she liked the style of the frame, and hadn't seen glasses that strong before. She remarked on how bad my vision was, which was quite a conversation starter!! </p><p> </p><p>I don't know how well this addresses your point, but I thought it was worth adding. Hopefully others will be along to post their thoughts</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ariadne</b>&nbsp;04 May 2016, 01:48</p><p>Personally I don't understand this whole glasses over contacts fetish.  You want to see blurry as possible to allow you to wear the thickest glasses possible.  It might be a buzzkill for some of you, but you can always turn it off when you have had enough.  What about those of us who wear thick glasses?  We can't turn it off.  All of the distortion of the world that comes with wearing strong glasses might seem pretty cool to you, but to us it's an everyday part of life.  Contact lenses don't work for everybody, it depends on your eye condition. </p><p> </p><p>I hope that I do not sound insulting.  But I would like to hear from anyone who does this glasses over contacts fetish so that you can explain the goal to me.  Do you enjoy having the blurriest vision possible or wearing the thickest glasses possible?  I wonder what part causes the sexual stimulation to you.  I don't think I have seen other women do this, so I think it must be a guy thing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2016, 09:56</p><p>Rebecca </p><p>I somewhat responded to you in the "Induced Myopia" thread, but I don't think GOC is a good option for you. First of all most of the people that do GOC do it for 2 reasons, recreational use meaning only part time and because they are past the age where they can no longer induce any myopia. But your certainly young enough that wearing stronger glasses than you really need should pose very little trouble for your eyes to be changed rather easily. In fact I really think you may be pleasantly surprised with the results of your eye exam today. Your certain to at the very least need the glasses your wearing but I think your likely going to get an increase as well. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rebecca</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2016, 06:41</p><p>Hi all, I posted on the inducing myopia thread earlier, and am now considering trying GOC.  Once again, I'm 16 and have a very mild prescription of about -1 in both eyes, with astigmatism in the left. </p><p> </p><p>I'd like to know what a good starting script for GOC would be.  I want the lenses to be thick enough that my friends would notice the increase, but not question it. </p><p> </p><p>I'm also not sure what type of contacts to get (daily, weekly, or monthly), or what contact prescription will match the glasses.  Do I need to get fit for contacts at an optometrist?  I've never worn them before.  I would be ordering them from Clearly Contacts. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2016, 04:19</p><p>I think the sexual aspect to the GOC fetish is extremely strong.  It is probably the same to the GOCY as getting caught wearing women's panties.   </p><p> </p><p>If the GOCY is so-called caught, either the person wouldn't notice or the person would say something innocent like they didn'tt know you wore such strong glasses or did you get new glasses.  It would never ever ever enter the person's mind that the GOCY bought contact lenses to extensively blur his vision and wear thick strong glasses because the GOCY is sexually thrilled over the act.   </p><p> </p><p>but if the GOCY gets caught, would it be not an advantage.  the GOCY would be justified in wearing the thick glasses all the time.

<p><b>another anon</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2016, 22:46</p><p>I have actually been "caught" a couple of times. The first time wasn't really getting caught because I did it on purpose. This was at a job I had years ago. I had worn my -4.0 glasses (my real rx) to work everyday for nearly two years. Then I went to exclusively wearing my contacts for many months after that. After I accepted another job at a different company, I spent the whole 2 week notice I turned in to that company wearing my -12.0 glasses and corresponding contacts. One co-worker noticed and asked me if I got new glasses and asked if they were stronger. The next time was a t a grocery store but she didn't mention my glasses even though I was wearing my -20's. </p><p> </p><p>I can't speak for the others here, but I think the fear that I still sort of have of getting caught at times is because there is heavy sexual relationship with my GOC activities. It revolves around the helplessness and vulnerability I feel when I'm a pretend to be high a myope. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>undercover</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2016, 02:57</p><p>Calcat, squint lover and anon - interesting posts here, and I too don't want to post my regular username for various reasons. </p><p> </p><p>I know how you feel squintlover with regard to losing glasses. I have somehow lost a pair of -13 myodiscs I had and wore for GOC purposes. I only wore them on 2 different occassions, once for several hours, and the other was for the majority of the day. The vision I had out of the myodiscs compared with lo-index/ regular lenses in other glasses for the same prescription was suprisingly much crisper and clearer. I didn't expect this given the peripheral vision issue you suffer with myodiscs, and having never worn them before I was sceptical as to how they would be but pleasantly surprised. It is therefore to my annoyance that I have lost them - god knows how, but I have! With regard to what attracts more attention, I would say that it depends what you are doing when you are GOC'ing. I like to go to malls / shopping centres and have interaction with people/shopworkers as I find it interesting to see how people treat me without glasses (I don't wear any sort of correction regularly!), and with strong glasses. I have found that you get some intriguing and inquisitive looks wearing myodiscs, and more comments / positive feedback with the thicker regular index lenses. </p><p> </p><p>With regard to not wanting to be discovered, as calcat said, I don't share this desire as given I don't wear glasses or contacts on a day to day basis, how does one explain that you're now wearing glasses with highly myopic lenses in that are over 1cm thick (a couple of pairs have lenses that 13.5mm thick!) Not an easy one to explain away and this is why I tend to drive for about 40 minutes out of where I live/work and visit places where I know the circle of people I mix with won't visit. Trying to explain why you're wearing strong glasses would be a difficult one to anyone I knew, and if it was fed back to my wife who knows I love a gwg, but doesn't know such a thing as GOC exists I'd be in a whole load of ****!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;22 Mar 2016, 20:26</p><p>In reflecting on my own journey to wearing strong glasses, I have come to appreciate recently that there are many people who are still in various stages of comfort when it comes to how to express their desire.  As others have done for me in the past, I try to meet everyone where they are at in their journey.   </p><p> </p><p>The inner desire is simple.  We want to shine in the day in front of the whole world wearing strong glasses.   </p><p> </p><p>But we live in a world that is culturally programmed against our desire at many levels.  Needing glasses is perceived as a defect.  Thick glasses are perceived to be ugly.  People assume you are "disadvantaged" with poor vision and you can't do things that "require good vision" like sports and arts.   </p><p> </p><p>It can take many steps to peel away each layer of these common perceptions that run against the grain of what we would like to share with the world.  You have prove to yourself and to the world that you are happier and not any less of a person or less able to function when you wear strong glasses, and you may have to do that one step at a time.   </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps you enjoy wearing glasses at home, but you pop in contacts before leaving the house because culture as programmed you into thinking that you are more attractive or athletic that way.  They say it will help you in your job, get more dates, etc.  Fighting this advice takes some effort on our part, as we have to ignore what everyone else is saying, do what we want to do instead, wear glasses, and then prove over a period time that we are just as attractive and successful as a person wearing glasses, if not more so, than if we had just gone with the flow and wear contacts.   </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps you have to take the deliberate step to object to the optician that tries to convince you in every way possible to upgrade to a hi-index lens.  "Surely you don't want the ugly thick lenses, right?"  "Why don't you just wear contacts, you'll be happier".  It takes personal initiative to disrupt things and say "I prefer thick lenses" and articulate all the reasons, against common perceptions.  And it takes time to convince those people that you aren't just having a moment of insanity, but that you are truly a happier person wearing thick glasses.   </p><p> </p><p>GOC treads deeper against the tide.  "Why would you make your vision worse" is what people say.  Now you have to be that lonely voice against common perception that explains and then proves over time that you are not making things worse for yourself, but that you are making things better, whether that be through different experiences and deeper understanding of optics, lenses, vision conditions, or whatever your reason for GOC might be.   </p><p> </p><p>It can take some effort to shine in the day wearing strong glasses.

<p><b>bracesfan</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2016, 04:23</p><p>My strongest cylindrical GOC is: CL +6,50, cyl. -10 at 90 and glasses +0,5, cyl. -11 at 180. Such strong astigmatismus mixtus is really an aexperience.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AAlex</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2016, 10:18</p><p>Weirdeyes asked about cylindrical GOC. </p><p>Here's my experience. I'm 28 and have played with over prescribing and GOC for about 10 years. </p><p> </p><p>My "official" contact prescription is Air Optix Night &amp; Day b.c. 8.6 O.D. -3.25, O.S. -3.50 that corrects me to 20/13. </p><p> </p><p>Last year I bought a big box of trial toric lenses on ebay that included samples of different brands, base curves, and prescriptions. </p><p> </p><p>I have a Snellen chart and trial lens set and played with the lenses to see how they behaved. </p><p> </p><p>For me the lenses with minus cylinder on the 180 axis rotated the least, followed by 90 axis. Axes 20 to 80 and 100 to 160 seemed to rotate more when I blinked. 70 and 160 distorted my vision the most but were too unstable. </p><p> </p><p>After experimenting I bought the highest cylinder plus lenses I could find that weren't a special order. The lenses were Oasys +6.00 -2.75 x 180 for both eyes. That translates to +2.25 +2.75 x 90. </p><p> </p><p>When I the lenses I wore them for about a half hour to let them stabilize and used my trial lens set to determine my best prescription. My goal was the prescription I would receive from an optometrist if this was my actual vision. </p><p> </p><p>I ended up with a prescription O.D. -6.25 -3.25 x 85, O.S. -6.50 -3.50 x 95. I can see 20/15 with these contacts and the glasses I ordered with this prescription. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2016, 07:12</p><p>Lens polish comes down to personal preference but I get a lot more "wow those are thick glasses" comments with polished edges.  I think this is because the shiny edges produce more reflections, which some people like because it makes the lenses look more jewel-like but can draw attention to their presence.  They also increase internal reflections, and can accentuate the "coke-bottle" effect, especially if the lense have a significant edge bevel.   </p><p> </p><p>I think if the goal is to hide the lens in a thick plastic frame, going without polish will help the lens blend in more, while the polish would have the opposite effect.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>squint lover</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2016, 04:41</p><p>30calcat, </p><p> </p><p>What exactly is the advantage of not having the lenses polished? </p><p> </p><p>sl</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2016, 16:36</p><p>You are on the right track with the small frame size.  Find a thick plastic frame with fat temples/arms and most of that 7.5mm of thickness will be hidden.  Put in the order notes to not polish the lens edges and you'll be able to wear those -14s around without getting any attention - even many of us OOs wouldn't even look twice.   </p><p> </p><p>Myodiscs attract attention, in my experience.  People are most observant of how your eyes look straight on (not from the side) because they are most engaged with you when looking at you in a conversation.  For even a non-OO, the non-blended myodiscs that the mass-produced lens labs are cranking out these days produce very obvious rings that clash with the shape of most frames.  At minimum, I have received comments from people that myodiscs "look funny" when I wear them.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>squint lover</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2016, 12:00</p><p>Hi all! </p><p> </p><p>It has been quite some time since I last posted to this group, but once again I would highly appreciate some help. Last year around July I was asking about your experience regarding doing GOC in public. </p><p> </p><p>My personal Rx is </p><p> </p><p>OD -3.75, cyl -.25, axis 152 </p><p>OS -3.25, cyl -.75, axis 32 </p><p> </p><p>With +8.00 contacts I got my GOC prescription </p><p> </p><p>OD -14.25, cyl -.25, axis 152 </p><p>OS -13.50, cyl -.75, axis 32 </p><p> </p><p>I had two GOC glasses (one full field and one that were basically myodiscs) with which I could easily read the 20/30 line and could have probably also read the 20/20 line if it wasn't for the severe minification. However, I somehow lost both of them when I moved just recently. </p><p> </p><p>The problem I had with both pairs was that I would never have had the guts to go outside with these glasses since I am afraid of meeting someone I know and people being suspicious of that jump of over -10. I was also considering getting a pair that is maybe around -8 to -10 (which I personally like a lot to look at on other people), but have dismissed this idea because I wouldn't be pleased with them knowing I could have stronger ones. </p><p> </p><p>So, since I have lost my recent GOC glasses and I know that the prescription works very well for me, I was considering maybe spending a little more money on the next pair. I still want to order from Zenni because I have been very pleased with their work so far, but wanted to go for a little smaller frame size and the highest index possible. I have found a frame that I know would suit me very well because it looks almost identical to my actual glasses. But even with 1.74 lenses and a lens width of 47 (22 bridge, my interpupillary distance is 68, so the lenses are centered almost perfectly), the calculator at opticampus (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180811031035/http://www.opticampus.com/tools/thickness.php)" target="_blank">http://www.opticampus.com/tools/thickness.php)</a> predicts a lens thickness of 7.5 mm. Unfortunately, Zenni does not provide aspheric lenses at that prescription anymore. I am pretty sure that those glasses would still look way more appealing than my recently lost ones, but I'm a little afraid that I would still be too shy wearing such heavy bricks outside.  </p><p> </p><p>Does one of the more experienced GOCers maybe have some tips how to further decrease lens thickness? Or is 7.5 mm thickness as good as it gets? The one myodisc pair I had was just made that way without me asking for it and I found myodiscs rather easy to handle and cosmetically not too bad. Is it possible to specifically ask for myodiscs when ordering at Zenni in order to reduce lens thickness? And what do you think would make people more suspicious: very thick lenses or myodiscs? </p><p> </p><p>I appreciate any thoughts! </p><p>sl</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Agda</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2016, 17:28</p><p>Hi all. I think I would like to share my excuse of getting your eye checked while wearing GoC. </p><p> </p><p>I pretended to suffer from keratoconus, an eye condition where the cornea mis-shaped and causing the person to ghost image. The contact lenses that I was wearing under my thick glasses is required to correct the shape of my cornea. </p><p> </p><p>Of course I don't want to be so knowledgeable in the topic to invite suspicion. So I just said to the doctor that I'm wearing the contact lens under my glasses because otherwise, I see double. And this can't be corrected with glasses. </p><p> </p><p>The doctor I visited was a GP as part of my annual medical check up. Of course this might not work with ophthalmologist, but might work if you visit eye doctor at a remote area, and just said that you lost your glasses, need the contact lens, and just need new glasses prescription. </p><p> </p><p>Enjoy..... </p><p></p><hr>

For that to have happened, your eyeballs would have had to suddenly grow larger (longer), which is extremely unlikely.  Or, your Crystalline Lenses had a significant increase in PLUS power.  That can happen with Pseudo Myopia, but that requires that your Ciliary Muscles were able to Squeeze your Crystalline Lenses to increase their power.  It is very likely that Presbyopia, which is the stiffening of your Crystalline Lenses would have make that impossible.  That pretty much leaves the development of Cataracts as a reasonable possibility because one of the effects of Cataracts is that they swell the Crystalline Lenses in addition to clouding them and that can cause an apparent in Myopia or a decrease in Hyperopia, sometime called Second Sight in older people. </p><p>2. Tear Production. </p><p>To do GOC, you obviously need to wear Contact Lenses.  As we get older, it is very common for tear production to decrease and Dry Eyes to become a problem.  Contact Lens comfort depends on tears to lubricate and keep the cornea moist.  Contact lenses actually float on a tear film.  The tear film also does something else. Your Corneas are living tissue, but have no blood supply.  The get their oxygen from the air plus oxygen and nutrients from the tear film. </p><p>Older people can successfully wear Contact Lenses, but they require careful fitting by an Eye Care Professional.  Have you ever worn contact lenses? </p><p>If Cataract Surgery is recommended, you may be able to decide the prescription you want to wind up with, within reason.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2016, 21:40</p><p>Gasman, </p><p>We can help you, but we need lots more information.  Based on the limited information you provided, my first estimate is +7.50 contacts for -18 glasses. </p><p>That assumes that you presently need -7.00 glasses. </p><p>Vertex Distance effects, with -18 glasses 0.32 diopters per mm.  Vertex Distance, which is the distance from your Cornea to the back of the glasses lens is VERY hard to estimate and hard to measure, even if you have the glasses. </p><p>Here are a few questions. </p><p>1. What is your Age? </p><p>2. What is your COMPLETE Prescription? </p><p>3. What is your occupation? </p><p>4. Where do you live" </p><p>Please do not attempt GOC with the above estimates unless you have plenty of money to waste.  At best, High Prescription GOC is an inexact science and it is often necessary to make several changes to get wearable glasses. </p><p>Also, I strongly recommend NOT going directly to -18.  You need to work your way up a few diopters at a time, to give your brain time to learn how to deal with the reduced Images size, the distortion, and possibly reduced Visual Acuity. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gasman</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2016, 13:32</p><p>Hi having seen my prescription jump from -4.25 &amp; -4.75 to both eyes being -7.00 in just two months ,I have been referred to my local eye hospital by the optition,but until my appointment I bought the cheaper option lenses and wow the lenses are quite thick but to be honest I quite like the attention and the feel of these thick lenses so checking out sites found this one,so having the perfect timing for suddenly having to wear  thicker lenses in my glasses without question I really would like to go extra thick possibly -18 or-20 any one out ther got any idea's as to what contacts are regd for say -18 thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2016, 11:25</p><p>Brille, </p><p>The best way to do GOC is to start with an eye exam for glasses.  The problem with starting with a Contact Lens prescription is that they are often compromise prescriptions that combine Sphere correction and Cylinder correction (add 1/2 the cylinder to the sphere) if the cylinder correction is not too large.  The reason for doing this is to avoid using Toric Contact Lenses that have Cylinder and Axis correction. </p><p>If you are going to be wearing glasses anyway, the best place for any Cylinder correction for Astigmatism AND any Add you may need, is in the glasses. </p><p>There is a second problem with starting GOC with less than the best possible prescription is your age.  The calculations for high prescription GOC become uncertain because of a major UNKNOWN in one of the elements.  That element is Vertex Distance, which is the distance from your Cornea to the back of the glasses lens.  The Vertex Distance effects involve the square (^2) of the glasses prescription.  Vertex Distance is not critical in prescriptions below about +/- 4.00, but it becomes extremely critical at high prescriptions.  For example, Vertex Distance effects are about 0.25 diopters per mm at -15.  The trick there is to slightly under PLUS the contacts or over MINUS the glasses and use your accommodation to make up for any errors.  Unfortunately, you have very little accommodation left to correct small errors and we have to be more accurate. </p><p>If you don't want to bother with an eye exam, I strongly suggest that you start with GOC -4.00 glasses to get used to wearing MINUS glasses.  Here is a prescription: </p><p>OD Sphere -4.00, Cylinder 0.00, Axis 0 Add +2.00 </p><p>OS Sphere -4.00, Cylinder 0.00, Axis 0 Add +2.00 </p><p>You can order from Zenni or other online retailer. </p><p>You will need +5.00 contact lenses to make the glasses work.  +1.00 of the +5.00 will correct for your Hyperopia and the remaining +4.00 will compensate for the -4.00 in the glasses. Use the same Diameter, Base Curve and Brand as your existing CLs. </p><p>You are, of course free, to ignore all of the above and do what you want to.   When you get used to wearing the -4.00 glasses, move up to -8.00.  You can gradually work up to -15. </p><p>If you don't want to do that and have plenty of money to spend, order the following. </p><p>Glasses: </p><p>OD Sphere -15.00, Cylinder 0.00, Axis 0 Add +2.00 </p><p>OS Sphere -15.00, Cylinder 0.00, Axis 0 Add +2.00 </p><p>Contacts </p><p>+13.00 </p><p>The Vertex Distance Calculations for -15 glasses say that you will need +13.3 contacts to match -15.00 glasses at 12 mm and your +1.00 Hyperopia. </p><p>Please understand that GOC IS NOT and exact science.  There are NO guarantees. </p><p>If you decide to start at -15.00, please remember that Stairs and Curbs ARE NOT where you think they are and initially, you will thing you are 3 meters tall. </p><p>Please let me know what you decide to do. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bracesfan</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2016, 00:27</p><p>George: </p><p>If you choose an optical store you don´t regularly visit there is absolutely no chance they could notice your contacts.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2016, 09:42</p><p>George </p><p>Well hopefully you plan on going to an optical store that doesn't know you? There is a very good chance that the optician will notice you're wearing contacts when he or she is repairing your glasses and readjusting them on your face. They likely wouldn't even say anything if they did notice and might just assume that you have such a high prescription that you wear part of it as contacts and part as glasses so your glasses aren't even thicker than they already are. And there you have your answer as well. If they were to comment about seeing the contacts simply say that you wear part of your prescription in contacts so your glasses wouldn't be any thicker. Now the only problem I can foresee is if they would need to keep your glasses in order to fix them.  </p><p>Just curious if your concerned you know you can go on line and buy some really good quality glasses form Zenni (zennioptical.com) for well under $20.00. so if it going to cost much to fix your glasses you might be better off getting a new pair anyway.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2016, 10:02</p><p>PleaseGuide, </p><p>You should have plenty of accommodation available for just about anything.  However, when doing high prescription GOC that people who have natural high myopia generally took years to get there.  Vision actually occurs in the brain, the eyes are merely biological cameras.  Your brain has to learn to process the images produced by high prescription glasses.

Being an average myope at -3,5 diopters I´ve got glasses +8 with -12 cylinder. The sight is beautifuly extremely elongated, you just need to combine plus in one axe and minus in the other. Good to try with trial kit. Now I consider trying even higher cylinder, about -16... Of course you can hardly go outside not seeing a thing :-) </p><p>With contacts it´s different.  </p><p>The principle is the same, plus in one axe, minus in the other. I´ve got Hydrasoft Options by Cooper at +6,50 and -10 cylinder. They made cylinder up to 11. The sight isn´t so much elongated as with glasses but it´s possible to correct it with glasses. Mine are +0,50 with -11 cylinder. Of course the picture isn´t absolutely sharp but quite good to make common things. </p><p>I think there are some other types of soft contacts at the market and of course some companies make custom made soft contacts and RGPs which can have nearly unlimited cylinder.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Jan 2016, 14:30</p><p>Brille, </p><p>You will have considerable difficulty starting GOC in the -15 range. The difference in the images delivered to the Brain while wearing very high prescription glasses requires some re-programming by the brain to effectively process the images and that takes time.   </p><p>Vision actually occurs in the Brain.  The eyes are merely biological cameras. With rare exceptions, people who need high prescription glasses developed that need gradually, over a period of years.  That does not mean the that you cannot do effective high prescription GOC, you just have to work up to it.  Fortunately, it does not take years. </p><p>Because of your age and your actual prescription, I would suggest starting with no more than -4.00 bifocals with a +2.00 Add, but if you want to do GOC full time, because of your profession, you may want to start a bit lower than that. </p><p>Effective and comfortable GOC requires planning.  Whatever you decide, Glasses are the last thing you order.  It is a very serious and expensive mistake to buy (or be given) existing glasses from any source and then try to find a Contact Lens that will make them work for you.  That rarely works and the effort is soon abandoned because the combination is miserable to try to wear. </p><p>You have a head start because you already wear contacts.  But, the place you need to start is a recent Glasses Prescription.  Contact lens prescriptions are often compromises, particularly if you have low Astigmatism that is troublesome to correct with Toric Contacts. </p><p>GOC is NOT an exact science, particularly at high glasses prescriptions.  The culprit is Vertex Distance (VD) effects and several types of distortion in high prescription lenses.  Vertex Distance effects are a Square (^2) function of the glasses prescription and Vertex Distance is very hard to measure or estimate.  At +/-15.00, VD effects are close to 0.25 diopters per mm.  We can deal with that. The Chromatic, Pin Cushion or Barrel distortion, and Spatial Distortion common in high prescription lenses can only be managed by the Brain.  </p><p>We can help you, but you need to be willing to follow our guidance, that is the result of many successful GOC projects.  If you want to do your own thing, we wish you well and as we say in Texas, "Y'all be careful, hear."  </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

A female friend found the glasses in my home recently and asked me who they belong to. When I said they were mine she was rather surprised and said she didn't think I was so nearsighted because the glasses I usually wear are much thinner. I said that I wear those glasses (the thinner ones) on top of my lenses because I hadn't got a new prescription and needed the extra help. That seemed to convince her.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2016, 09:32</p><p>Brille, </p><p>I will help you, but unless you have an unlimited budget and a lot of time to waste, you need to be willing to follow a procedure that has, for the most part, been successful.  However, you need to understand that GOC is NOT an exact science, particularly at the higher prescriptions. </p><p>Many people who are just starting GOC make two mistakes.  One, they want to start with a high double digit glasses prescription and Two, they buy some high prescription glasses online with the HOPE that they will be able to find some Contact Lenses that will match the Glasses to their existing Vision.  That generally does not work and the combination cannot be comfortably worn. </p><p>Vision actually occurs in the brain.  The eyes are merely biological cameras. When you significantly change the images delivered to the brain, it can take time for the brain to work with the different images.  There are a few exceptions, but most people who need very high prescriptions did not suddenly need them.  Often, they became Myopic in childhood and gradually worked up to their current prescription.  You need to do something like that, only a bit faster, when you do GOC. </p><p>May I ask a few questions? </p><p>1. Your Age and Gender? </p><p>2. Your occupation? </p><p>3.

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2016, 00:04</p><p>manofspex  </p><p> No,I think that -4.00 would be too much to begin with,but you should easily handle -2.75,and perhaps several months later,move into -3.75. </p><p> In addition to wearing the overprescription constantly,you need to modify your visual behavior.Do the things that a myope does such as squinting when looking at distant objects,and holding reading material as close to your eyes,as you can tolerate,all while wearing the overcorrection. </p><p> At even -8.00,I doubt that you need to worry about retina detachment. Also when you reach a point that you think that the lenses are strong enough,you then stop overcorrecting.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>manofspex</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2016, 22:09</p><p>I gave that some consideration. I basically induced the -1.75 diopters that I currently need (started needing -0.5 a year and a half ago and then did a lot of reading/near work) but I'm concerned about retinal detachments and other problems that could potentially accompany severe myopia.  </p><p> </p><p>I haven't ruled it out yet though.

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2016, 21:35</p><p>manofspex  </p><p> Instead of glasses over contacts,why not induce myopia? </p><p> You could begin by wearing -2.75 for all activities. You then should read as close as you can tolerate with glasses on. With the demands of college,and later medical school,you should have no problem becoming a real high myope.I would think that -6.00 to -8.00 should be relatively easy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2016, 00:09</p><p>manofspecs, </p><p>Thanks for the info.  To do GOC calculations you always start with the desired Glasses Sphere Power and plan to order the glasses from an online retailer such as Zenni.  Your plan on starting with -6.00 or -8.00 is a good one.  Some people want to start with a very high prescription, but High Rx GOC can get pretty tricky for two reasons.   </p><p>1. Vertex Distance effects in High Rx Glasses can be huge very difficult to estimate.  If you examine the math that follows, you will understand why. </p><p>2. You have to learn to see with High Rx Glasses.  People who develop High Myopia do it gradually over a period of years.  High Rx GOC happens suddenly and the experience can be traumatic. </p><p>BTW, NEVER buy existing glasses from any source and hope to be able to find some contacts that will make them work.  It is almost impossible to do. </p><p>GOC Calculations </p><p>If the desired glasses Rx is above +/- 4.00 always do the calculations for Vertex Distance (VD) effects.  Vertex Distance is the distance from the front of your cornea to the back of the lens in the glasses.  It is very hard to measure accurately.  The calculation is the same as that done to convert Refracted Rx to Contact Lens Rx. </p><p>Step 1. Calculate the Vertex Distance effects of the proposed Glasses Sphere Correction:  e.g.-6.00 </p><p>  -6.00 x -6.00 = 36 Note the sign is lost </p><p>  36 / 1000 = 0.036 diopters per mm </p><p>  0.036 x 12 mm = 0.432  12 mm is a typical Vertex Distance </p><p>  -6.00 -(+0.432) = -5.568 effective power of a -6.00 lens at the cornea </p><p>Step 2. GOC Contact Lens Power calculation. </p><p>Remember.  Corrective lenses neutralize or cancel out refractive errors.  If you actual glasses prescription is -1.75 the Vertex Distance effects are negligible and can be ignored.  Therefore the effective power at the cornea is -1.75 and the -1.75 neutralizes your +1.75 refractive error.  To neutralize the -5.568 refractive error required by the -6.00 glasses you will need an additional: </p><p>  5.568 - 1.75 = +3.818 in a GOC contact lens, but you can't buy that power Contact Lens.  All you can buy around that power is +3.50, +3.75. or +4.00.  If you used +4.00 the result would be that you would be slightly Myopic with that GOC combination.  Your distance vision would be a bit fuzzy with your Crystalline Lenses fully relaxed at minimal PLUS power and  you could do nothing about it.  If you used +3.75 you would have a tiny bit too much MINUS in your glasses for your "Eye Power".  At your age, you could easily add the extra PLUS you need to compensate for the extra minus.  However, I believe that you would like +3.50 better because your glasses would offer about 1 step (-0.25) MINUS over correction which would result in more crisp vision (20/15 perhaps). </p><p>You have made no mention of any Cylinder and Axis correction in your glasses.  If you did have any Cylinder and Axis you would transfer the numbers EXACTLY to the GOC Glasses Prescription. </p><p>I would suggest ordering some low cost -6.00 glasses from Zenni Optical.  If you choose the $6.95 frames and low index lenses the cost will be around $12.00 with shipping.  If you don't know how, we can help you.  You will need your Pupillary Distance (PD), but if you don't have it you can easily measure it with a mm ruler and a bathroom mirror. </p><p>Using the above as a template, why don't you do the calculations for -8.00 glasses and let me review your results. </p><p>Please feel free to ask about anything you don't understand. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2015, 07:19</p><p>Husqvarna, </p><p>Safe, high quality GOC involves careful planning and probably an eye exam, unless you already wear contact lenses and know your contact lens prescription.  Contact lens prescriptions include the Power, Base Curve, and Diameter.  Also, you need to learn how to insert and remove the contact lenses.  In addition, it is important to learn how to care for the contact lenses to avoid infections that can permanently damage your Corneas. </p><p>Assuming you actually have NO refractive error (your prescription is 0.00 with NO Astigmatism) you will need +7.25 contact lenses with the -8.00 glasses, assuming that the glasses have NO Cylinder correction. </p><p>It is very doubtful that you will have good vision with GOC glasses and contact lenses unless you follow the correct procedures.  Incorrectly fitted contact lenses can be very uncomfortable to wear and can be dangerous to your vision. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2015, 06:34</p><p>HD, </p><p>At this time, I cannot suggest a good source of CLs that do not require an official prescription.  I used to suggest CLs from a company in Vancouver, Canada, but they changed their policy about a year ago.  To some extent, it depends on where you live.  Perhaps some of our active GOC members can offer suggestions. </p><p>Please DO NOT order any glasses until the CL issue is resolved.  It is an expensive mistake to buy high prescription glasses and then try to find CLs that will make them work.  Your Astigmatism is a potentially complicating factor. One of the most important principles of GOC is to only manipulate the Sphere correction in the Contacts or Glasses.  Any cylinder or axis correction in your prescription is copied EXACTLY, without alteration, into the GOC glasses. </p><p>I can give you an approximate CL Sphere for -7 and -12 glasses.  The best approach is to use the same Sphere power contact in each eye and fine tune the glasses prescription as needed. </p><p>For -7 glasses you will need approximately +3.50 contacts. </p><p>For -12 glasses you will need approximately +7.00 contacts. </p><p>Both approximations consider Vertex Distance effects in the glasses. </p><p>Because of your age, you can use a little less PLUS than is calculated in the Contacts or a little over in the MINUS in the glasses and let your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses make up for any small amount of additional PLUS you may need.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2015, 15:21</p><p>HD, </p><p>GOC is probably a better idea than trying to Induce some additional myopia.  The question there is your Myopia increasing on its own?  You have an eye exam scheduled for Tuesday.  Any particular reason?  Are you planning on asking for an exam for Contacts?   </p><p>Unfortunately, with your Astigmatism, your ECP may be thinking of Torics or a Compromise Sphere only CLs where 1/2 of the Cylinder is added to the Sphere.  Topics are often hard to fit because for some people they tend to rotate when you blink which means that your vision changes from good when the axis is aligned with your actual axis and really bad when it is not. </p><p>If you want to do GOC you are only looking for a few things as a result of an exam for Contacts. </p><p>1. Instruction on how to insert them, remove them, and care for them both physically and hygienically. </p><p>2. A comfortable Brand of CLs </p><p>3. The best Base Curve for you. </p><p>4. The best Diameter for you. </p><p>For GOC you want to wear Sphere ONLY contacts and put your Cylinder and Axis correction in the glasses. </p><p>-12 is probably too much to start with.  You can start where you want, but there is a learning curve involved in doing GOC.  Most successful full time GOC wearers started with perhaps 3 to 4 diopters over their actual Sphere and worked their way up.  The primary reason is that you brain has to learn to "see" with a very high prescription.  Most people who need very high prescription MINUS glasses started wearing MINUS glasses in childhood and their prescription increased at -1 to -2 diopters per year.  There are significant Vertex Distance effects that increase exponentially as the prescription increases and often significant edge distortion and chromatic distortion with very strong glasses.  Because you already wear glasses around -3, I would suggest -6 or -7 glasses for your first GOC experience. </p><p>A few questions: </p><p>1. What is your Occupation? </p><p>2. How stable is your prescription?  Amount of change between this prescription and your last one and the time between exams. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mark</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2015, 03:28</p><p>I had an interesting and quite possibly unique experience with GOC yesterday that was quite surreal! Not sure where to post this, in sightings or here so I'll do both. </p><p> </p><p>I was wearing my big roundish unisex glasses yesterday that I've found give me close to the best vision when doing GOC out of the several pairs I can use and was in a shop when I noticed a cute gwg browsing the aisles a couple of rows away from me. I looked over in her direction to admire her a couple of times, and at the third time of looking at her she noticed me and smiled. I smiled back at her and a short time later we had both ended up in the same aisle. She looked at me commented that she liked my glasses!  </p><p> </p><p>All the hairs stuck up on my arms with nervous anticipation! I thanked her, and said they were new and getting used to them, but they were very comfortable (what else could I say!). She then asked if she could try them on as she was contemplating getting new glasses in this style. I was lost for words almost! I said that she most certainly could, but they were a lot stronger than hers, she asked how I knew, and I said I was just guessing (again, how could I let on!) She said she didn't mind about that. </p><p> </p><p>She wasn't a high myope, nowhere near it, probably -3 or -2.5 - something low like that but she liked the frame, and this style of frame is very fashionable at the moment in London. Just before she tried on my glasses, she looked at the rather thick lenses (in this frame they're just under 1cm thick, the polished edges protude out of the sides), and commented on them, touching my arm in a friendly flirty sort of manner "oh my, your poor thing, your lenses are rather thick aren't they!". I laughed, and wondered what to say given this was the first encounter with a gwg wearing glasses!! I said, "I hadn't really noticed but yep, it's a slippery slope once your eyes are as bad as mine". She put them on, and with my induced myopia I couldn't see her as well as I would've liked - but then this alteraction would've never happened without GOC - she squinted hard and looked around the shop, smiling and said how comfortable they felt on her and how she liked the bigger frame compared to her rectangular wide armed frame, but then she took them off after saying she couldn't see much! I'm not surprised given they were probably 3 times the strength of her own glasses!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ambrose</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2015, 11:19</p><p>@ Mark,thanks for the post.i prefer my blended myodisc pair that are 75% tinted almost like dark glasses but enough to reveal the awesome strength of them.they are ultra comfortable and soothing on the eyes in bright light yet still have this mystical look about them that reveal what they are in a more subtle way..I prefer wearing them over the clear pair even if it's dark and if am out for the evening,they still provide awesome vision.went out one evening with friends,asked few questions and eventually gave them off as some wanted a closer look.guess they wanted to see exactly what these were.perhaps should mail those interested a pic..</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>paul</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2015, 10:57</p><p>hi guy,thanks for all your comment,i have started goc now  which is great,can anyone tell me where I can get plus contacts above +20s as I would love to go higher in time ,I would love to have -30s,paul</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mark</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2015, 08:55</p><p>Ambrose - I did a bit of GOC'ing today with the combination I have mentioned before, but tried a couple of smaller pairs of glasses I have with the same prescription to see whether it made any difference and how I got on. One of these were a pair of (prescription) sunglasses - maybe I should coin a new phrase on SGOC (SunGlasses over Contacts) :) </p><p> </p><p>The lens measurements were 54 and 53mm wide, by 30 and 31mm high. </p><p> </p><p>As I suspected, the smaller frames didn't offer any peripheral vision either to the side, or below, and when crossing several busy roads I had to severely turn my head in order to see through the glasses due to it all being a blur when I looked sharp left or sharp right. </p><p> </p><p>Likewise, when browsing in the supermarket for daily essentials looking up and down the shelves and aisles was not as comfortable as it was when I changed from the smaller glasses to the slightly larger 55mm wide by 40mm high frames. </p><p> </p><p>The lens thickness is noticeably thinner in the smaller frames and only protudes out of the frames by 3 or 4mm where as the bigger frame which is the same shape (hexi/rectangular) has lenses that protude of the side by about 10mm. But all of us that are doing GOC are doing it because we want to experience that high myopic feeling, and with that comes thick lenses, so why would you want to have thinner lenses?! It's like having a curry but not having any spice in it. Or at least that is my opinion! This is obviously dependent on the prescription as -20's will be far more noticeable than the -9.5's I was wearing today in term of their lens thickness.  </p><p> </p><p>Part of the appeal to me is the thicker lenses and strong cut in that stands out. As it was today, I only experimented here for about an hour, but I still probably got 4 noticeable glances at my glasses with the thicker lenses than I did with the smaller glasses with thinner lenses. </p><p> </p><p>Draw your own conclusions though and maybe get one big and one small pair (or more) like I have</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ambrose</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2015, 13:15</p><p>I have found the smaller the frame and lenses the easier to get accustomed too.besides sit closer to your eyes and the smaller frame preferably acetate hides the lenses think ness.i good anti reflective coating is a must as well as my small -20 pair look really normal even though a blended myodisc </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mark</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2015, 01:34</p><p>Paul - I would be interested to hear how you get on with this with you being a first time GOCer. This is a dream combination for someone doing GOC and you don't start practising this to do a boring combination of something like -5, but to truly feel and see what the effect of being a high myope is like.  </p><p> </p><p>I only know what I've seen on here, and have done GOC several times with +5 contacts and -9ish glasses. I am awaiting my third pair of -13's to do GOC with +8 contacts and can't wait, although I do have reservations about the lens thickness in my latest frames that are coming as there are significantly thicker than the -9 glasses I have used before. </p><p> </p><p>What sort of frames have you bought for GOC? I have found that at this higher sort of prescription the bigger frames are better as it will help your peripheral vision a lot, and with smaller frames your peripheral vision will not be covered / I experienced a big blur outside of the glasses when I tried with a regular hexi shaped frame and quickly reverted to a bigger style of frame in order to help achieve a natural correction. </p><p> </p><p>I'm very intrigued about this and now you've been provided with brand names, and a prescription I'll look forward to hearing how you got on!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Robert S</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2015, 19:36</p><p>I would go in steps it is more fun putting on stronger glasses on the way up. You get to experience that stronger glasses feeling more than once. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2015, 11:28</p><p>Paul, the brain learns to adapt pretty quickly. I'm sure you can get some CLs made using the numbers others have given you, and be on your way. It will be odd at first, and may take a few days to get used to the new vision, but you'll get there.  </p><p> </p><p>Many of us here did not work our way up in power and did just fine. My first GOC set was +20D glasses and -25D CLs. I managed to get used to in fairly quickly.  </p><p> </p><p>Good luck! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ambrose</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2015, 10:40</p><p>Paul,I think you definitely can as I started doing this early this year and never experienced any of the so called side effects or vision distortion that are mentioned in previous posts.i too have no refractive error at age 41. </p><p>I purchased two pairs off eBay one with a -19,pd 64,75% percent tinted and a clear pair with -20 pd 64.i can quiet comfortably see near and at distance wearing these perfectly with a + 19 pair of contact lenses,proclear brand  and can be ordered online.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2015, 07:50</p><p>The experts say that you can't do it Paul, and in a way I suppose they are right. It is extremely hard to get used to a high prescription combo.  But I believe that you can do it.  You will need a pair of +16.50D contact lenses in order to wear these glasses at a vertex distance of 12.5mm, which is a pretty normal distance. </p><p>When you put the contacts in and put the glasses on over them you will experience a feeling sort of like you are on a carnival ride. You will feel a bit dizzy and very disorientated. But this will pass after a while.  Since you already have the glasses if you can get the contacts I suggest that you go for it. After your brain adapts then you will have no problem and you can wear this combo all day long and feel great. </p><p>Good luck, and let us know how it works for you. I would never suggest this if you were starting out by buying the glasses and contacts, but it will work if you perservere.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2015, 03:53</p><p>Paul - it is very unlikely that you will be able to GOC with these glasses due to your naturally good vision, and the incredibly high prescription of the glasses. The two aren't a good combination for GOC as CJ has pointed out a few times. He has also stated that when doing GOC you should start low(ish) and work your way up. </p><p> </p><p>Please let us know if it does work, and where you find contact lenses strong enough for this, and what power they are!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2015, 10:42</p><p>paul, </p><p>If you are serious about doing GOC, getting some high prescription glasses and trying to find some contacts to make them work is doing it backward.  The results are seldom satisfactory.  The reason is that Vision actually occurs in the brain.  The eyes are merely biological cameras and your brain has to learn to "see" with the substantially minified images produced by the Vertex Distance effects of -20.50 glasses. </p><p>If you actually have 0.00 refractive error, which is very unlikely, you would need some Contact Lenses in the +15.50 range.  Most people who are under 40 and think they have excellent vision, are actually somewhat Hyperopic or Farsighted or Long Sighted and may have some Astigmatism.  If that is the case, you may need both different Contact Lenses and Different Glasses for really good vision. </p><p>Remember that most people who need -20.50 glasses did not start there.  They developed Myopia when they were young and it gradually got more severe at the rate of about -1.00 or occasionally -2.00 diopters per year.  These increases were small enough that learning to "see" with their new glasses only took a day or so.  Being able to see clearly again made the increase a very pleasant experience.  Going from not wearing vision correction to -20.50 can be a traumatic experience for anyone and in your case may be an expensive and potentially dangerous experience.  Nothing will be where you think it is, including Stairs and Curbs.  It won't be as bad as wearing +20 glasses with the associated loss of peripheral vision, but -20 glasses are like wearing very wide angle photographic lenses and everything will appear to be farther away and it is likely that you will experience very significant "barrel distortion" at the edges of your visual field.  Can you get used to all this, yes, but it takes some time and many people who try it, quickly give up in frustration.  Most people who do successful GOC start with a much smaller increase and work up over time.  It won't take years, but it also won't happen over night. </p><p>We can help you do successful GOC, but you need to be willing to follow our advice.  You may be able to wear a GOC combination in the -20 range in the future, but you need to start much less ambitiously. </p><p>The place to start is with an Eye Exam.  Because you don't presently wear glasses, we need to get an idea of your existing refractive error, if any, so you will know what to say to the Examiner to get started. </p><p>May I ask a few questions? </p><p>1. Where do you live? (Country) </p><p>2. Have you ever had an Eye Exam? </p><p>3. Do you want our help? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2015, 12:29</p><p>Jonathan James, </p><p>Don't sweat it.  This GOC combination is not very aggressive and you should not have much trouble adapting to it and wearing it as much as you want, Including to class and to work. </p><p>The trick for avoiding much comment is to retain the same frame style.  Most people do not notice the lenses nearly as much as the frames.  If you decide to change frame styles, you really don't have to say any more than you decided to get some new glasses.  If there is a comment about the prescription, just say that Law School is pretty hard on the eyes, without going into much detail.  I suspect there are plenty of people in your law school classes who are wearing glasses that are significantly stronger than -5.50. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jonathan James</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2015, 10:59</p><p>Cactus Jack &amp; DS, </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for your responses. I have never been very good at math ;). </p><p> </p><p>Do you think I could wear this GOC combination to work without people noticing the difference in strength much? I only work part-time (one day a week). My collegues do know that I wear glasses sometimes. I guess if someone asks, I could always say that my real glasses have high-index lenses and that my GOC glasses are my spare pair. </p><p> </p><p>Or do you think it would be too much of a dare to wear them to work sometimes? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DS</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2015, 20:21</p><p>Jonathan, </p><p> </p><p>Watch out for a math error at </p><p>  &gt; +5.00 + (-1.25) = +4.25 for both eyes  </p><p>--&gt;  5.00 -   1.25  = +3.75 </p><p> </p><p>I'm calculating that -5.50/-0.25 @12mm translates to effective -5.16/-0.22 @0mm.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2015, 14:02</p><p>Jonathan James, </p><p>That looks good.  My suggestion would be the +4.00 contacts.  GOC, even at lower prescriptions, is not an exact science.  At 25, your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline lenses should have no difficulty adding a bit of PLUS if you need it.  If you wind up with too much PLUS in the Contacts or too little MINUS in the glasses, you have no means to compensate without different power contacts or glasses. </p><p>Please let us know how everything works or if you have more questions. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jonathan James</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2015, 11:43</p><p>Of course I meant I could use also +4.00 contacts, not +4.50. Sorry for the mistake.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2015, 12:31</p><p>Sparky, </p><p>I try to make it a policy to not comment on decisions that have already made.  GOC at the higher powers (above -10) must be approached carefully to have any chance of comfort and success.  The LAST thing you should do is order the glasses.  The FIRST thing you should do is get a fresh complete eye exam for both glasses and contacts.  You are very fortunate to have a wife who is curious and cooperative.  You don't want to blow this opportunity by NOT doing it right.   </p><p>The primary reason for NOT buying glasses, made for someone else, and then trying to figure out a CL that will work and be comfortable, is that it is nearly impossible.  Almost all, very high natural prescriptions, have a Cylinder component that is very likely wrong for your wife </p><p>As soundmanpt said, you are very fortunate that your wife is agreeable to doing GOC.  She may ultimately be able to enjoy wearing a very high GOC combination, but going from -1.50 to -16 for any reason is very difficult.  Part of getting used to wearing GOC is allowing your brain to learn how do deal with the smaller images and the distortions caused by high power lenses.  You have to work up to it.  People who need -16 glasses did not start there.  They probably started needing a moderate MINUS prescription in their childhood and it gradually increased as they grew to adults.  Probably never more than 1 or 2 diopters per year.  It won't take years to work up to -16 or so, but it also won't happen over night. </p><p>I will be happy to try to help you, but I must insist that you do what we suggest, the way we suggest you do it.  Soundmanpt and I have worked with many GOCers, mostly with good success.  However, we are not very good at turning bad decisions into good ones.  If you want to continue on the present -16 path, by all means do so.  As we say in my part of the world "Y'all be careful, hear!". </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2015, 09:46</p><p>sparky </p><p>I'm assuming since your wife's actual prescription isn't very strong she probably doesn't wear contacts? So the first thing she needs to do is is call her ECP (eye care professional) and make an appointment to get here eyes examined and fitted for contact lenses. Since she will be wearing contacts to do GOC she needs the contacts to fit her eyes properly. I would suggest that you hold off with ordering her glasses until she gets her eyes examined just in case she has some astigmatisms to deal with. Hopefully she doesn't and she only has her -1.50 correction. But if she does your going to want to put the astigmatism correction in the glasses and not the contacts. I think "Cactus Jack" will agree with me that I think your being far too aggressive. In the optical world -7.00 is considered strong. If you fit her with -7.00 glasses and +4.00 contacts, (Cactus Jack is better at providing a more accurate combination than I am) if she takes off her glasses she is only going see a massive blur. You want her glasses to be strong enough so they are slightly over correcting her vision.  </p><p>You should be very happy that you have a wife that is willing to participate by even agreeing to do GOC. But she may not enjoy it if she isn't able to see perfect or at least very close to perfect.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rimpopper</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2015, 21:10</p><p>I need to get new plus lenses to continue with GOC, which I've been doing for 10 years. Globallens requires a prescription now, and I need a new source.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2015, 08:58</p><p>Sasha </p><p>When you say that you want to start wearing glasses there are several ways to start wearing glasses. The one way is where your at now by doing GOC (glasses over contacts) This method allows you become a glasses wearer without altering your actual vision. The other method which age is a factor is to just start off wearing weak glasses and changing the prescription of them every few months which is called inducing myopia. This method may or may not change your actual eyesight causing you to actually require glasses.  </p><p>Doing the GOC most usually choose to go with plus contact lenses and minus glasses for appearance sake. I assume you eyesight, as far as you know anyway, is perfect? So it would be very foolish for several reasons to try going too strong right away since this would be the first time anyone ever sees you wearing glasses. Also the higher you go the harder it is to get the combination correct so your vision is perfect with your glasses. So I suggest nothing stronger than -3.00 glasses which may sound very weak but for someone with perfect eyesight -3.00 make things extremely blurry without glasses. But doing GOC is going to require you to get your eyes examined first to be certain that your eyesight is perfect or if you maybe have a minor correction needed, but also you need the fitting done so your able to order prescription plus contacts. So you claim your wanting colored contacts non prescription as your reason for wanting contacts. Then of course you need to find a good source to order your prescription contacts from. Then you can go on line and find the glasses you want to wear and order them in the same prescription but with minus lenses. So doing GOC is going to cost you a few dollars the first time. Now if you just want to wear glasses and don't have any objections to your eyesight possibly being changed then you can always just order glasses and you won't need to get an eye exam or fitting since you wouldn't be wearing contacts, just glasses. But by going glasses only you will need to start off with weak glasses that your eyes will be able to tolerate. Personally anything between -.50 to -1.00 would be good to start with. Of course the -.50 would be extremely easy for your eyes to adjust to and even though they are weak you would still notice some blur after wearing them for a while when you take them off. But -1.00 is a bit more aggressive and at first you would feel the pull on your eyes but the blur when you take your glasses off would be much more noticeable to you. Just getting glasses by going to Zenni (zennioptical.com) you should be able to find well over 800 for under $20.00. Doing GOC because of the needed eye exam and fitting as well as the contacts and glasses the total cost would likely be around $250.00 - $300.00.  </p><p>Whatever you choose there are several in here that can be of help to you getting started.   </p><p>    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jarred</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2015, 08:51</p><p>Hi CJ, </p><p> </p><p>With my 'real' glasses they always grind the prism into the lenses which makes them thicker at the temples. I've ordered a few pairs of glasses from Choice Eyewear over the years but even after charging me $20 for the privilege they always seem to just decentre the lenses to get the prism, which is a bit of a cop out in my opinion. </p><p> </p><p>I've ordered glasses from Optical4less and they grind the prism in as I would expect. </p><p> </p><p>Even though the prism is split between both eyes, the last pair of glasses from Choice Eyewear had all the prism in the right lens, its quite obvious when you look at them. So not very impressive really. </p><p> </p><p>With the newest glasses from Choice Eyewear my VA is pretty good albeit not 100% comfortable with all the prism in one eye. </p><p> </p><p>I used the Prentice rule to work out the amount of decentre the lenses. I need 6PD of prism split between each eye. So with Prism/Lens Power= decentre in CM. So with my -14D lenses I have 3/14= 0.21 centimetres (in theory)with base out the lens should be moved nasally. </p><p> </p><p>I have been playing with GOC for many years now and have tried both high myopia as well as hyperopia. I have a full trial lens set which I use to fine tune the prescription which seems to work very well. I find high minus prescriptions have some advantages over my normal vision, I like the wide angle of view and having the ability to slide the glasses down a little for readings is very handy. </p><p> </p><p>J </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sasha</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2015, 03:38</p><p>Nomad,hi! for what reason you want to wear plus glasses?  I too want to wear glasses.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;14 Aug 2015, 12:46</p><p>Jarred, </p><p>That might work, but I would suggest ordering the least expensive pair you can to verify the results and then ordering another pair if you satisfied , with the features you want.  The location of the Optical Center (OC) of the lenses is very touchy at high prescriptions, which I am sure you are aware of.  The ideal location of the OC is co-incident with the central axis of vision of each eye for the best results and best VA. </p><p>Could you provide a bit more information? </p><p>1. Where do you plan to order. </p><p>2. What numbers did you use to arrive at the 2.1mm in each eye. </p><p>3. How is your VA with your present glasses. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jarred</b>&nbsp;14 Aug 2015, 10:37</p><p>I'm looking at purchasing another pair of glasses online but I'm thinking of being a little smarter this time. I have 6D base out of prism split between both lenses in my real prescription that I need to add, the last two pairs of glasses I've ordered I've been charged $20 for prisms and when received all they have done is decentre the lenses to induce the prism rather than make proper prisms. </p><p> </p><p>My thinking is that I can enter a decentred PD and not fill in the prism and hence save myself $20. </p><p> </p><p>With a -14D prescription and using Prentice rule I calculate that I'd need to move the PD inwards in each eye by 2.1mm. </p><p> </p><p>Can anyone verify my figures. Also has anyone else tried this approach with success? </p><p> </p><p>J </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2015, 20:57</p><p>GOClover, </p><p>So far, I have stayed out of this discussion because, frankly, you scare me.  Over the years, Soundmanpt, DS, and I, along with several others have helped many members do successful and enjoyable GOC even into the -20s, but there are three universal rules for success (at least). </p><p>1. NEVER try to do GOC with existing glasses from any source that are not specifically made for YOUR situation and GOC combination, particularly if there is any cylinder involved.  It is very unlikely that that you will do anything other than waste money because the results will likely be unwearable and possibly dangerous. </p><p>2. ALWAYS begin with an eye exam for contacts because it is very important that the Base Curve and Diameter of the CLs need to be selected for comfort and safety.  Also you need instruction in how to insert and remove the contacts safely and how to practice good hygiene.  Incorrectly fitted contacts and poor hygiene can cause permanent and irreparable damage to your corneas.  It is just too easy to learn how to do this right and very safely. </p><p>3. DO NOT try to be too aggressive in selecting your 1st GOC glasses power.  Usually 4 to 6 diopters difference between your actual prescription and the glasses prescription is about the absolute maximum difference your brain can deal with.  If you have never worn any vision correction before, you might not want to start with that much difference.  People who NEED to wear very strong prescriptions, did not start there.   </p><p>Very strong glasses have can have very significant effects on image size delivered to the retina and can also have very significant distortion and chromatic aberration.  Vision actually occurs in the brain, and your brain has to learn how to interpret the images.  The eyes and corrective lenses are simply biological cameras. People who need very strong glasses, particularly minus glasses, generally did not start there.  They often needed -2 or -3 glasses when they were quite young and because of genetic predisposition, needed -0.50 to -1.00 increases per year into their early 20s. </p><p>The fact that you wanted to start with a very specific, very high MINUS Sphere and high Cylinder glasses made me think that you really did not understand very much about optics and vision.  You may be able to work your way up to very high minus Sphere correction in a year or so, but any cylinder correction in the glasses MUST BE very close to your actual need.  You have the built in ability to correct for a bit too much MINUS Sphere in the glasses, as Soundmanpt suggested, but you have absolutely NO ability to correct for any cylinder error, except by using external lenses with the correct Cylinder and Axis for YOUR Astigmatism. Both the Cylinder and Axis are critical and must exactly neutralize of cancel out your actual Astigmatism or they are worse than no correction at all. </p><p>I urge you to re-think what you want to do with GOC and pay close attention to what those with lots of experience have to say.  Be sure and answer all their questions accurately.  There are technical and practical reasons for every question they ask and every suggestion they make.  We want your GOC experience to be very pleasant, but we need a starting place.  The ideal place to start is with an eye exam, but it helps if the symptoms or desires you express make sense to the examiner.  Many people who have think they have very good vision are actually a little bit hyperopic or farsighted though some are mildly myopic.   </p><p>There is a fairly easy test you can do at home to get a preliminary idea of your vision.  It will not detect small amount of Astigmatism, but it will detect amazingly small amounts of hyperopia or myopia.  All you need is a pair of +1.50 Over the counter readers, something to measure up to about 1 meter or 36 inches, and a book or newspaper with normal sized text.  Let me know if you are interested. </p><p>Answers to theses questions would be helpful: </p><p>1. Where do you live? </p><p>2. What is your occupation? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2015, 17:08</p><p>GOClover </p><p>I am starting to get a bit confused by the different names I see. Okay so if what your saying is that your eyesight is perfect and you wish to do GOC I would first suggest that you go to an eye care professional and say  your wanting to get colored contacts. This will not only get you an eye exam which is a good idea anyway but also will get you the necessary diameter and base curve information you will need to place your order for +5.00 contacts, clear of course not colored, next you want to pick out the glasses your planning on wearing. Because the contacts sit directly on your corneas and glasses sit about 3/4" in front of your corneas you need to order your glasses a little bit stronger than the contacts. If anything allowing your glasses to even over correct your eyes isn't a bad idea anyway. So you should order your glasses in -5.75. This is not only a good combination to start with but your glasses won't look overly strong to the average person, but at the same time without your glasses being on the blur will be amazing for you.  </p><p>Hope this helped and if you have any further questions feel free to ask.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2015, 15:52</p><p>@Nomad, ah ok, low plus. that's easy. +5D will be easy to adjust to. And you're just getting to the point where the CL power differs ever so slightly from the glasses power. For example, if you wear no correction at all, a -5.50 CL would work fine with +5 glasses. If you're going to err at all, you want the CL to be a little bit stronger than you really need, as at your age you have the accommodation to make up the rest. However, if your CLs have too little power then your distance vision will be a tad blurred and you won't be able to do much about it. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2015, 15:07</p><p>DS </p><p>What I was saying, and I couldn't find where he / she has or doesn't have CYL in their actual prescription is that if so the CYL is best put into glasses as opposed to contacts.  </p><p>If this person doesn't have a need for CYL it would be foolish to even consider messing around with something like that.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nomad</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2015, 14:06</p><p>@NJ, @ DS </p><p> </p><p>Well I did say low plus, I don't really want to go that high especially when it becomes conspicuous.  I an young and have pretty much 20/20 vision (uncorrected), so I assume a 4-5 dioptre wouldn't be an issue.  I don't really want to go past what I can pick up from online retailers.  I just want some pointers on how to get started.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DS</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2015, 12:04</p><p>@Soundmanpt: Was that really a question?  I think we're on the same page regarding avoiding cyl in the contacts.  I'm suggesting that GOClover NOT try to put an unnecessary 4D cyl in glasses that would require a toric lens to compensate.  This way, only a simple sphere is required. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2015, 09:53</p><p>and DS is right about the reading add. With +20 distance lenses I need at least +3 add to read, sometimes more. Usually a presbyope with a low distanct Rx needs +2 or so. At least, that was my case when I wore low plus glasses with my native correction.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2015, 09:50</p><p>@Nomad, I've done GOC with both high plus glasses and high minus glasses. Of the two, the high plus glasses are much more difficult. To begin with, the vertex effect is reversed from high minus glasses in that your CL script needs to be stronger than the glasses. For example, +20D glasses will require around -26 to -28 CLs, depending on how far the lenses are from your eyes, assuming no native correction is needed. Second, there is a huge loss in peripheral vision with high plus glasses, so much so that you'll find many activities, like just walking around in crowded places with people moving about, really challenging. Although you can get used to some of these problems, they never really go away. There's a reason why you occasionally see high minus wearers driving but almost never high plus wearers. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2015, 06:58</p><p>DS </p><p>You don't want to be putting the "CYL" and "axis" in the contacts? You should always include that in the glasses and only use plus "SPH" contacts. First of all toric lenses are much more expensive and makes it even harder to get the correct combination for doing GOC. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DS</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2015, 06:18</p><p>@Nomad: It certainly works the other way, too.  But, since the field of view is reduced with strong plus glasses you have to be especially careful in any day-to-day activities.  Where the "image jump" at the edge of minus glasses shows a double image, the jump at the edge of plus glasses is a blind spot.  This can be quite significant for strong plus lenses. </p><p> </p><p>Also, those approaching presbyopia should be aware that more accommodation is required for reading when wearing plus glasses and that reading may become difficult with the combination when stronger combinations are used. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DS</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2015, 06:09</p><p>@GOClover- Do you have a prescription for glasses that we can start from?  Age? </p><p> </p><p>You could order +15.00 contacts and either -18.25 or -18.50 glasses (no cyl). </p><p> </p><p>If you want cyl in the glasses, then you'll either need a contact lens fitting to get accurate alignments, or you can just use a minimal amount of -0.25 (negligible effect after vertex distance compensation) and an axis between 10 and 180, rounded to the nearest 10, with 180 being a fine choice.  We could do better here if we had your natural prescription. </p><p> </p><p>If you want other powers, take a look at the chart here: </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180811031035/http://artoptical.com/files/documents/resources/Vertex_Conversion_Chart.pdf" target="_blank">http://artoptical.com/files/documents/resources/Vertex_Conversion_Chart.pdf</a> </p><p>(URL may wrap) </p><p> </p><p>From the chart, pick the minus power of the glasses you want from the right (+) column, then order the + contacts from the middle (12mm) column (ignore the left (-) column).  I would advise getting the glasses one step stronger than the chart (hence the option to choose -18.50 with the +15.00 contacts). </p><p> </p><p>Note: You mention "perfect" and "exact" in your posts, but without actual measurements this is going to be neither.  It will be "very close" and usable, though.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nomad</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2015, 21:17</p><p>Most GOC threads and questions are about minus glasses and plus contacts, but what about the opposite, are there any special concerns or difficulties?  Is the recommended power for a beginner still 1-5 dioptres?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DS</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2015, 10:04</p><p>GOClover, </p><p> </p><p>With that cylinder, you will need a toric lens to compensate.  The rotation of the lenses on the eyes will impact vision. </p><p> </p><p>Also, the vertex distance is important at that prescription.  How the glasses fit will affect the power you need. </p><p> </p><p>So, while someone could assume you naturally don't require correction and suggest +17.00 -2.50 x 25, it's unlikely you'd be successful with such a "blind" approach.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mark</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2015, 01:01</p><p>Squintlover - I've only done GOC 4 times, as detailed earlier in this thread, and whilst I unsuccessfully tried it a few years ago, I've made a real effort this time and have gone in with a high combination prescription. I have a very mild myopic prescription, but the transformation from barely needing glasses to being a high myope wearing big glasses with thick lenses (I've found the smaller frames just dont do it for me, and I'm constantly having trouble when looking down or outside the frames parameters) is a thoroughly enjoyable feeling, and a very moreish one at that. I have done this in shopping malls / large retail parks outside of town when I've had a morning / afternoon free where I know I won't bump into anyone I know.  </p><p> </p><p>Its only in the last two weeks that I've resurrected this, and I have found it EXTREMELY addictive, but like you, I can't walk round my area, or be in my office wearing -10/-9.5 glasses when my prescription is about a 1/5th of that! It would be TOO obvious and too odd for people who I see everyday. Members of my office left early the other day and I so I had 1 1/2 hours to myself in the office at which point I whipped out the contacts and glasses and enjoyed 90 minutes of GOC bliss. I was worried someone would come in or buzz at the door in which case I would either be left in a blur without the glasses on, or have to think of another excuse damn quick! </p><p> </p><p>I have ordered a stronger combination of contacts and glasses (about another -3 for each - the lenses were so thick I had to order 1.6 index lenses otherwise they would've been about 16mm thick, which would draw too much attention for my liking) and am looking forward to that rush again, but for me I think there is no point in doing a small GOC combination as what's the point? You want to see what being -5 is like, or -6? No, I want to feel that rush of being highly myopic, but being able to change back when I feel like it - the best of both worlds! :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2015, 15:02</p><p>squint lover </p><p>Without a doubt the first thing anyone is going to notice right away is new frames. So the bigger problem right away will be the frame difference. Honestly I agree with the others that hardly anyone except those few that really have any knowledge of optics would notice the stronger lenses. And then if you were to get the high index lenses that would even make it harder for anyone to tell any difference. But if they first notice that your wearing new glasses then the are much more likely to pay more attention to the lenses. I would suggest that you maybe should order glasses in your current prescription but with CR39 lenses but if possible order the same frame that you have your -14.00 lenses in with the high index lenses and I don't think anyone would notice the difference. If the frame is no longer available then you may have to start over by ordering new glasses in your actual prescription as well as with the -14.00 lenses. I'm sure your ordering your glasses on line so they shouldn't be too expensive even if you have to get all new glasses. In the long run probably cheaper then getting contacts and glasses in the weaker prescriptions. I assume since you enjoy doing GOC and your vision is 20/20 with your -14.00 combination you probably want to wear GOC all the time.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>squint lover</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2015, 14:30</p><p>Is anyone else experiencing that wearing GOC and strong glasses in general is pretty addictive? </p><p> </p><p>I've been having my first combination for about 6 months now and since then I treated myself another pair in the same prescription (both -14ish, one pair with rather high index lenses that actually looks surprisingly thin and one with low index myodiscs) and have been thinking about ordering a combination for around -8 to -10 very often. So far I have only found +8 contacts, which perfectly add up with my natural prescription of around -4 (of course, I calculated everything using the complete prescriptions and could get away with 20/20 if the letters weren't that damn small :D ) for the -14s. </p><p> </p><p>I have rather little spare time on my own at the moment to enjoy this "addiction" and I have the urge to insert some lenses as soon as I know that I got some undisturbed time. However, I have never gone outside with my combination because I'm afraid someone I know might see me. Even though people in here always say that non OOs can't tell the difference, I don't believe they won't recongnize a jump in prescription of over 10 D. That's why I thought about maybe getting a weaker combination. </p><p> </p><p>What I'm interested about is: do you also consider yourself somewhat addicted to GOC? And how do you guys handle this addiction and the rush of those first seconds when everything becomes so extremely crisp from a total blur? And what does it feel like getting another increase and putting on new stronger glasses for the very first time as a real high myope? Finally, do you think getting a weaker combination would make sense to start wearing outside for the first time to have a less extreme effect?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DS</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2015, 19:42</p><p>CJ-- You are using an approximate formula for vertex distance compensation that can make the math easier to estimate in your head going one direction, but using the actual formula is more accurate and quite easy to use as the solution for Pold is extremely similar with the difference being absorbed into a convention for distance.  Solving for Pold in the approximate formula involves the quadratic equation hence your iteration in lieu of ignoring an imaginary root.  No sense in making the math trickier to arrive at a less accurate answer! </p><p> </p><p>The accurate VD formula is "Pnew = Pold / (1 + d * Pold)" where Pold is the original lens power, d is the distance (in meters) the lens is being moved (the convention is that d is negative if moving towards the eye and positive is moving away), and Pnew is the new lens effective power. </p><p> </p><p>To be more generalized in an example, I'm going to use a prescription for a single eye but with cylinder correction as well.  It's important to treat the spherical and cylindrical components separately. </p><p> </p><p>Starting with a glasses prescription of -2.50 -1.00 x 180 (vertex distance = 12mm) and a +8.00 contact lens: </p><p> </p><p>1) Get the true powers of the meridians. </p><p>  P(sph) = -2.50 (the "sph" of the prescription) </p><p>  P(cyl) = -2.50 + -1.00 = -3.00 (the "sph" plus the "cyl") </p><p> </p><p>1) Vertex these powers back to corneal plane (d is negative, moving toward eye) </p><p>  Pcornea(sph) = -2.50 / (1 + -0.012 * -2.50) = -2.43 </p><p>  Pcornea(cyl) = -3.50 / (1 + -0.012 * -3.50) = -3.36 </p><p> </p><p>  Note: If you wanted an equivalent contact lens prescription, it would be -2.43 (-3.36 - -2.43) x 180, or -2.43 -0.93 x 180.  After rounding, it's the same as the glasses prescription and why adjustment isn't necessary with weaker prescriptions. </p><p> </p><p>2) Add the corrected meridian powers to the inverse (i.e. negative) of the contact lens to get the new "prescription" at the corneal plane. </p><p>  Ecornea(sph) = -2.43 + -8.00 = -10.43 </p><p>  Ecornea(cyl) = -3.36 + -8.00 = -11.36 </p><p> </p><p>3) Vertex these powers back to the spectacle plane (d is positive, moving away from eye) </p><p>  Espec(sph) = -10.43 / (1 + 0.012 * -10.43) = -11.92 </p><p>  Espec(cyl) = -11.36 / (1 + 0.012 * -11.36) = -13.15 </p><p> </p><p>4) Reassemble into prescription convention and round to nearest 0.25 </p><p>  -11.92 (-13.15 - -11.92) x 180, or (after rounding) </p><p>  -12.00 -1.25 x 180 </p><p> </p><p>  Note that because of the vertexing, the up to 0.125D error from final rounding appears becomes less at the eye.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2015, 10:00</p><p>mark, </p><p>If you want to do some serious GOC, you need to learn to do the math.  After you have some experience, Specs4ever has a lot, you will get to where you can get pretty close intuitively. </p><p>Normally, Step 1 is to use the glasses prescription to calculate their effective power at the cornea, which is the Contact Lens prescription.  I call the reverse of this number your "Eye Power".  It is the basis for the rest of the calculations.  In your case, with a glasses prescription of </p><p>L: -2.25, no cyl/axis, R: -2.50 no cyl/axis </p><p>The contact lens prescription would be the same.  Your Eye Power would be  </p><p>R Sphere +2.50  L Sphere +2.25 </p><p>Note that I listed the Right Eye first because that the traditionally listed first in a prescription. </p><p>Step 2 would be to decide on a target prescription for the GOC glasses and use the same math procedure for calculating the Contact Lens equivalent.  However, you have stated that you want to try some +8.00 contacts.  If we add the +8 contacts to your existing Eye Power we get: </p><p>R Sphere +10.50  L Sphere +10.25 </p><p>The next step is to find what power glasses will result in the reverse of those powers at the cornea. </p><p>This would be the same calculation that an ECP would do to determine a CL prescription. </p><p>Because there is a square function involved, I prefer to do successive iterations to arrive at the actual glasses prescription.  To state the question, What power MINUS glasses is required to neutralize an Eye Power of:  R Sphere +10.50 with a Vertex Distance (VD) of 12 mm? </p><p>Lets start with -12.00 </p><p>-12.00 x -12.00 = 144  (Square the Sphere prescription, note the loss of the sign) </p><p>144 / 1000 = 0.144 (Divide by 1000) </p><p>0.144 x 12 = 1.728 (Multiply by the VD to get the VD effect) </p><p>-12.00 + 1.728 = -10.27 (Using Algebra techniques add the VD effect.  Note: For MINUS glasses prescriptions CL Power will be LESS than the glasses power.) </p><p>Reverse the sign on the CL power = +10.27  EP needed.  Hmmm!  I need a bit more than -12.00 for the Right Eye, but it is almost perfect for the Left. </p><p>If you try a -12.25 glasses lens for the right eye, you will get +10.45 EP needed. </p><p>If you try a -12.50 glasses lens for the right eye, you will get +10.62 EP needed. </p><p>This is a little hard to get your mind around because we are very accustomed to thinking in terms of Glasses power which is the reverse of Eye Power compensated for Vertex Distance effects.  When doing GOC, we have to think in terms of both Eye Power at the Cornea vs. Glasses Power at a distance from the cornea. </p><p>In practice, I like to select and order MINUS glasses that are -0.25 to -0.50 stronger than the EP would indicate, particularly if the person is young.  At 24, you should be able to easily accommodate and add a bit more PLUS to compensate for the extra MINUS in the glasses.  For the +8.00 CLs, I would consider ordering: </p><p>R Sphere -12.75  L Sphere -12.50 </p><p>Try the calculations for a few different combos to get the feel for it. </p><p>Please let us know what you decide to do and how it works out. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

If you keep the same style frame, few people will notice a change in your prescription. </p><p>4. As the glasses prescription gets up to around -15, the Vertex Distance effects approach 0.25 diopters per mm.

<p><b>mark</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2015, 01:34</p><p>I've tried reading through all of this and understanding it myself, but it seems like an extreme science, and one that I'm having trouble wrapping around my brain! This was my first time doing GOC out about. I've done it at home, but never been brave enough to do it out and about as I know loads of people in my area and didn't want to come across familiar faces whilst doing this! Can CJ or someone else help with the finer points on this please or point me to the GOC calculator I saw on here years ago. </p><p> </p><p>I did some GOC yesterday with great success by researching a little on here, and elsewhere online. I managed to pick up some +5 contact lenses from a centre in London that does not require prescriptions, and allows a same day click and collect - just what the doctor ordered (wink wink :) ) - and given I have a tolerance / aptitude for accommodating between -3 and -3.5, I took two pairs of glasses out with me. I do not know their exact prescriptions as they are second hand ebay purchases, but comparing them to other pairs of glasses in my collection, I would estimate one pair is around -10.5 to -11, and the other probably -9ish. The lens thickness is noticeably different in both pairs, with the stronger pair having a really thick polished edge, probably 12-14mm in thickness, with the other pair only having about 4mm protuding out of the plastic frame (maybe they're high index lenses). Maybe someone can help with the maths on what +5 contact lenses would actually equal in a minus prescription to even things out? </p><p> </p><p>There was retail park almost just over the road from where I picked up the contact lenses, which was ideal for doing a bit of GOC.

I ventured out with the stronger pair, crossed the road, went into several shops and made a couple of purchases. The cashier who was also a glasses wearer himself gave me a funny look, almost staring at me for several moments when he was serving me, my glasses obviously bothered him! I had been wearing these glasses for probably half an hour to 40 minutes and when I went into another shop I felt my eyes straining a little, like the glasses were too strong for them, so took them off and put the other ones on. These were like a match made in heaven but I noticed the lens thickness in both pairs did distort my peripheral vision to the side and when I looked down. I wore this pair for a couple of hours and actually got a compliment from a cute gwg on my glasses when I enquired as to if she was queing in a shop! </p><p> </p><p>I will venturing out to the same shopping centre again today with a different pair of glasses that I estimate is approx -10. Now I have tried this strength of lenses, I would like to try other pairs of glasses I have which are -15, and -16/-16.5. What contact lenses would I need to match this? I'm 34, work in an office environment and keen to do more GOC as I actually woke up in the middle of the night excited with the prospect of doing more GOC today. Many thanks for your help, and sorry for blabbing on!</p><p></p><hr>

I had to wait a couple of weeks before I could insert contact lenses, per the ophthalmologists recommendations. It felt exactly the same as before. </p><p> </p><p>It's possible to alter your numbers to have the vision you want, but not many docs will intentionally give you worse vision. In fact, most will try to fully correct it using either the monovision technique or correct for distance only and you will need readers. I see Specs4ever managed to get his pre-surgical numbers, but he had a pretty good argument for doing so. </p><p> </p><p>If you do find a doc to give you worse vision, please think long and hard about doing this. It's one thing to have bad vision when you want it, quite another to have to live with it all the time. GOC works great for most people here.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;06 May 2015, 18:04</p><p>I asked the surgeon to implant a lens as close to my natural -2.50D vision in my one eye as he could. I can do GOC with almost the same contact lens prescription that I could before. Once I have the other eye done I will have it corrected for distance and then I should be right back where I was before I started to get even more farsighted in that eye.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 May 2015, 14:04</p><p>CONCERNED, </p><p>It is very likely that you will be able to continue, but the numbers for your GOC combos will likely change and it is likely that you will need bifocals, progressives or trifocals. </p><p>Modern cataract surgery with IOLs involves emulsification of your old crystalline lenses and installation of a fairly strong + IOL.  Everything is done through a tiny, 3 mm incision in the side of your cornea.  The incision is so small that it will heal without a stitch in just a few days to a week.  After it heals, you can easily wear CLs in any power, if you want to.  It is unlikely that your Base Curve or Diameter will change.   </p><p>I had cataract surgery in 2001.  Prior to the surgery, my actual prescription was -4.50 in one eye and -2.75 in the other with some astigmatism.  I opted for as near 0.00 in my dominant eye and -1.50 in the other.  I considered multi-focal IOLs, but at that time the optical qualities left something to be desired, if you like very sharp vision.  I don't know what multi-focal IOLs are like today, but I have difficulty understanding how the optics could have improved significantly.  I think they might be useful if VANITY is an issue, but the surgeon who did my surgery, would not install multi-focal IOLs for anyone who liked very sharp vision (engineers, etc.).  I had worn trifocals for years before the surgery, and I still do.  The mono-vision I now have enables me to function pretty well without my glasses, if I have to get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom or read a prescription bottle.  Right now, I am typing on the computer without my glasses. Think hard about what you want for a prescription after the cataract surgery.  You can't change your mind, later.  GOC and wearing high prescription glasses is fun, but it is nice to be able to decide WHEN you want to do it.  A friend recently had cataract surgery and he opted for a near 0.00 prescription in both eyes.  I had suggested that he might consider mono-vision, but he declined.  I was visiting with him recently and he was constantly messing with reading glasses to see up close.  I think he wished he had made a different decision on his final prescription. </p><p>In case you are concerned, modern cataract surgery is usually as close to a surgical non-event as you can get, but it is still surgery so follow the prep instructions and post op instructions to the letter.  I was scared s**tless for the first surgery, but it was completely painless and all over in just a few minutes.  They will likely briefly put you to sleep while they do final preparations on your eye, but they usually want you awake for the surgery itself.  I asked my surgeon if he would explain what he was doing as I watched the surgery from the inside.  It was fascinating.  When I went back the day after the surgery for a check, the doctor said everything looked good and my next question was, "How soon can we do the other eye".  He replied 2 weeks.  I was disappointed because I was so pleased with the results, I was ready right then. </p><p>May I ask your current actual prescription, what you want your prescription to be after the surgery, and your favorite GOC combo? </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2015, 23:21</p><p>Le Visiteur, </p><p>Somehow, I dont think you are going to like my suggestions.  Of course you can do what you want to do. </p><p>GOC is not an exact science and there is a bit of trial and error involved.  I do not guarantee that my suggestions will be wearable at high prescriptions.  Over the years of helping people with GOC, I have developed some procedures that seem to work very well at lower prescriptions, but are less certain the higher you go.  The big issue is Vertex Distance effects, which I will get into in a bit.   </p><p>You did not answer my questions about age or where you live and I did not ask about your occupation.  Answers to these questions are important and they affect my suggestions and how deeply technical I get with my explanations.  If you find GOC to be an enjoyable adventure - many people do - you need to UNDERSTAND what you are doing and what I am doing so we can communicate effectively. </p><p>You are concerned about costs, which is a good thing, and well executed GOC does not have to be expensive.  However, it can be very expensive and a GOC combination you cannot wear comfortably is the most expensive of all. </p><p>My experience has been that the Excel tables are very inaccurate at high prescriptions.  The reason involve Vertex Distance (VD) effects in glasses.  Vertex Distance effects calculations involve the Square of either the Glasses, Propter, or Trial Lens prescription and typically explain the difference between a Glasses prescription and a Contat Lens prescriptions.  At low prescriptions, below about +/- 4.00,  the VD is small enough that it can be ignored.  Also, VD, which is the distance from the front surface of the cornea to the back surface of the glasses lens (or the first lens in a Propter) , is very hard to measure.  A good number for VD is about 12 mm.  As I demonstrate the calculations, please notice that a VD that is off by 1 or 2 mm is inconsequential at low powers, but even 1 mm can make a big difference in Visual Acuity of glasses at high prescriptions. </p><p>Lets start with your prescription.  We are not going to worry about the Cylinder and Axis until we are ready for the final GOC glasses prescription.  There are two reasons we can do this.  1. Your Cylinder prescription is low and 2. We will copy the Cylinder and Axis exactly as prescribed into your GOC glasses.  A hard and fast rule is that we NEVER alter the Cylinder or Axis numbers for GOC or Inducing Myopia. </p><p>You did not mention if you had ever worn contact lenses.  I suspect that if you have they were either Torics or had a compromise Sphere prescription.  If you have worn contacts, I will need the Complete Prescription including Diameter and Base Curve.  If you have not worn contacts, we can deal with that, but I need to know. </p><p>Step 1 is to calculate the effective power of your glasses at your cornea considering VD of 12 mm. </p><p>OD Right Eye -3.75 x -3.75 = 14.06 / 1000 = 0.014 diopters per mm x 12 mm = 0.168 </p><p>0.168 is the VD effect of your right lens at your cornea.  If the glasses lens is MINUS you subtract the effect from the glasses prescription to yield the CL prescription (if the glasses prescription was PLUS you would add the effect to the glasses prescription. </p><p>0.168 +(-3.75) = -3.58 if there was no Astigmatism involved the next higher value of contact lens is -3.75, a tiny over-correction, but insignificant. </p><p>OS Left Eye -6.75 x -6.75 = 45.56 / 1000 = 0.045 diopters per mm x 12 mm = 0.54 + (-6.75) = 6.20.  The next higher available CL value is -6.25. </p><p>Glasses or Contacts neutralize or cancel out your actual refractive error and your actual refractive error at your cornea is the REVERSE of your CL prescription at the cornea and  First important numbers we are looking for.  Everything will be based on these numbers that I call your Eye Power. </p><p>OD R +3.75 </p><p>OS L +6.25 </p><p>Lets see what happens if we use the CLs from the Excel sheet. </p><p>OD R +3.75 +13 = +16.75 </p><p>OS L +6.25 +10.50 = +16.75  Note, above about +6 or +8 CLs only come in 0.50 increments.  If you are young enough, your ciliary muscles and crystalline lenses can easily supply a bit more plus if they need to.  Other than that, you were on track with a practical CL prescriptions. </p><p>Now the fun begins.  Because there is a Square Function involved that is based on the Glasses prescription, I use what is called successive approximation to arrive at the Glasses Sphere prescription that will Yield the desired reverse of the Eye Power at the cornea,  Please note the per mm VD effect at higher prescriptions. It is very critical. </p><p>Lets start with the -20 glasses. </p><p>-20.00 x -20.00 = 400 / 1000 = 0.40 diopters per mm x 12 mm = 4.80 +(-20.00) = -15.20  </p><p>hmmm, we need -16.75 to match the +16.75 </p><p>-21.00 x -21.00 = 441.00 / 1000 = 0.441 x 12mm = 5.29 +(-21.00) = -15.70 </p><p>-22.00 x -22.00 = 484.00 / 1000 = 0.484 x 12mm = 5.80 +(-22.00) = -15.70 </p><p>-23.00 x -23.00 = 529.00 / 1000 = 0.529 x 12mm = 6.35 +(-23.00) = -16.65 </p><p>almost </p><p>-23.50 x -23.50 = 552.25 / 1000 = 0.552 x 12mm = 6.63 +(-23.50) = -16.87 </p><p>too much! </p><p>-23.25 x -23.25 = 540.56 / 1000 = 0.540 x 12mm = 6.48 +(-23.25) =-16.77 </p><p>whew!. </p><p>As you can see, -20.00 will not work and I dont thing Zenni will make above -20.00 and there goes the budget and a fair amount of money down the drain. </p><p>Your vision with the -20 glasses would be about like your vision with your Right Eye without your glasses. </p><p>Hopefully, by now, you have concluded that there is more to successful GOC than you realized.  I have some suggestions about how to get started with GOC that you can comfortably wear nearly full time if you want to, but it is unwise to try to start too aggressively.  If you will answer my questions, I will try to continue the discussion tomorrow.  It is late here and I am tired. </p><p>BTW, if you would like to do this privately, please feel free to contact me at cactusjack1928@hotmail.com. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Le Visiteur</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2015, 14:16</p><p>Hey CactusJack, thanks a lot for your input in the online retailers section. You're right, let's forget about shipping: I dont't mind getting glasses and contacts from two different retailers, though I'd like to keep the overall costs to a minimum.  </p><p>From what I understand, Zenni will make glasses in 1.56 index lenses with an extra charge for strong minus, but they won't request a prescription/doctor's note - right? </p><p> </p><p>Also, my glasses prescription is: right -3.75 x -2.00 x 90 and left: -6.75 x -1.00 x 90.  </p><p>I'm planning on getting the glasses to correct the astigmatism and axis so that the contacts will only take care of the + prescription for the GOC system.  </p><p>According to the GOC table which is on Bobby's site, I'll require +13 contacts for the right eye and + 10.75 for the left eye for glasses of -20D (OS=OD). </p><p> </p><p>Does this seem right?

<p><b>Mike</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2015, 13:35</p><p>Advice taken thanks Cj, ill take it easy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2015, 12:27</p><p>Mike, </p><p>One of the rules about changing the power of glasses is that you ONLY change the Sphere part of the prescription, NEVER change the Cylinder and Axis part.  Note that the Cylinder and Axis in the suggested GOC glasses is same as the doctors prescription you provided. </p><p>Because you have never worn contacts, I suggest that you NOT jump directly into Extended Wear contacts.  It is like diving head first into water you don't know the depth of.   </p><p>The ideal thing would be to get fitted with contacts to correct your actual vision at your ECP because their services would include instruction on how to insert and remove your contacts.  Also how to care for them. </p><p>The Diameter of the lens is in mm and +/- 0.5 mm should not cause a problems.  Base Curve is the Radius of the front surface of your cornea or the inside curve of the Contact Lens.  A CL that is 0.1 mm less than what was measured will probably not cause any problems. </p><p>You need to be aware that even lenses that are an exact match in Diameter and Base Curve can vary in wearing comfort.  That is why most ECPs have trial lenses by several different manufacturers and expect to have to try several different brands to maximize wearing comfort. </p><p>I know you are anxious to get started, but I ask you to be patient.  Before you commit to any Extended Wear Contact Lenses, I strongly urge you to Google "Extended Wear Contact Lens Dangers" and pay attention.  I suggested starting with Dailies for more reasons than just the cost. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mike</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2015, 18:00</p><p>Cj, </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for your time. Just so i understand you correctly in simple terms. I should order plus 6 contacts and glasses od -13.25 sph and os -13 leaving the cyl and axis as is. Please correct me if im wrong. </p><p> </p><p>Regarding the cl order what would be an exceptable level of variance in diameter would 0.5 +/- be ok and as you stated previously for bc go slightly larger if possible. However if im measured at 8.7 could i safely try 8.6. Again please correct me if im wrong. </p><p> </p><p>Lastly as i have never worn contacts is there anything else i should know about wearing extended wear lenses. My wife wears dailies and just puts in her cls in the morning and tosses them at night nothing else no solutions. I am only wondering if anything else is required for extended wear. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus jack</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2015, 20:29</p><p>Mike, </p><p>Here are my calculations and explanations.  I prefer to start with a calculation of the Sphere glasses prescription referred back to the Cornea by considering the Vertex Distance (VD) effects of the Glasses, Phoropte, or Trial Lens Frame.  They are usually pretty close to the same  VD.  If the Sphere or Cylinder prescription is less than about +/- 4.50 diopters the VD effects will be negligible.  If you examine the effects of the Square function in the calculations, you will understand why. </p><p>You did not specify which eye the numbers represent so I will assume the first set of numbers apply to the Right eye and the second set apply to the Left. </p><p>Glasses Prescription </p><p>OD R Sphere -5.25, Cylinder -0.75, Axis 90 </p><p>OS L Sphere -5.00, Cylinder -0.75, Axis 85 </p><p>Typical Vertes Distance = 12 mm. </p><p>OD R -5.25 x -5.25 = 27.56 / 1000 = 0.02756 x 12 mm = 0.33 +(-5.25) = -4.91  </p><p>OS L -5.00 x -5.00 = 25 /1000 = 0.025 x 12 mm = 0.3 +(-5.00) = -4.70 </p><p>The final numbers are the calculated contact lens prescription to correct your Sphere refractive error.  The refractive error is the reverse of the CL prescription or R +4.91, L +4.70. </p><p>Sphere only contact lenses of +6.00 in each eye will result in Sphere refractive errors of: </p><p>R +10.91, L +10.70 </p><p>Now the fun really begins because of the Square function, the best calculations are Successive Approximations until you find the Glasses Sphere Correction that will provide the best correction for the new Sphere Refractive Error. </p><p>Right Eye: I tried several values from -12.25 to -13.00 and the closest calculations was as follows. </p><p>-13.00 x -13.00 = 169 / 1000 = 0.169 x 12mm = 2.028 +(-13.00) = -10.97 </p><p>Left Eye: From the previous calculations -12.25 looked promising, but -12.75 gave the best result. </p><p>-12.75 x -12.75 = 162.56 / 1000 = 0.1625 x 12 mm =  1.95 +(-12.75) = -10.80  </p><p>Because you are 33 you should have good accommodation and can wear a bit more MINUS in the glasses and make up the difference using you ciliary muscles and crystalline lenses. </p><p>Suggested GOC Glasses prescription: </p><p>OD R Sphere -13.25, Cylinder -0.75, Axis 90 </p><p>OS L Sphere -13.00, Cylinder -0.75, Axis 85 </p><p>A word of caution.  GOC is an inexact science and there are no guarantees that the above prescription is the best possible. </p><p>To answer your question about Contact Lenses.  Diameter is not very critical with soft contacts.  A few tenths of a mm in Base Curve wont make much practical difference.  If there is a choice, try to select a slightly larger Base Curve than 8.7 for the best comfort.  Less may tend to be too tight and not have good tear film circulation. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mike</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2015, 12:28</p><p>Also i will probably not use zenni. I purchased 4 pairs of glasses 2 pairs of indentical frames one each without lenses for this purpose because i can send a frame out to be relensed and still have the same frame. Anyone im around on a daily basis would only notice different frames not lenses thickness or power rings. So on days i am not gocing i wear the normal rx and still have the same frame.

The cl rx is the same except the axis is 90 degrees both eyes. </p><p> </p><p>I visited global lens i noticed that the options on their products does not match my dia and bc for any of the cls. Does it matter if those figures for bc and dia are a few tenths of a mm diffent? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2015, 08:48</p><p>Mike, </p><p>I apologize for not remembering you from last year.  I gave up on trying to remember everyone. </p><p>I would suggest checking out www.globallens.com/.  They are in Vancouver, Canada. </p><p>I am also a bit concerned about going straight to Extended Wear Contact for two reasons.  I suspect that being in the contracting business, you are occasionally in a dusty environment which is not always a good place for contact lens wearers.  I suggest that there may be a bit of experimentation until you get a combination you like.  For starting GOC, Dailies are a fairly inexpensive way to get started and gain experience.  The only disadvantage is that they are usually very thin and can be hard to handle.  Also, you may need to try several brands to find exactly what you prefer.  Longer wear lenses are generally thicker and more durable than Dailies. </p><p>I would suggest trying some +6.00 Daily wear lenses and some low cost glasses from Zenni as a starting point for two reasons.  You and your corneas need to get used to wearing contact lenses and you will probably want to increase your glasses prescription as soon as this combination is comfortable. </p><p>Before doing the calculations, I want to confirm your latest GLASSES prescription.  I don't want to use a Contact prescription because they are often compromises. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2015, 22:56</p><p>Mike, </p><p>For GOC in the -12 range +6.00 CLs are about right for a person with a glasses prescription around -5.00, but we need to do the calculations.  You need to use Sphere only contacts and copy the cylinder and axis exactly for the GOC glasses prescription.  Do not use a CL prescription as a starting point.  They often involve compromises that are not needed in glasses. </p><p>A couple of questions: </p><p>Your age?  Long term goal?  Where do you live? Education?  Occupation? </p><p>I am not familiar with any special hygiene necessary for extended wear contacts, but just make sure that you have good tearing action, your corneas get most of their oxygen from the air and tears provide additional  O2 plus moisture, nutrients and lubrication. Be sure and not wear the extended wear CLs more than the lenses are designed for, your corneas need periodic rest. </p><p>Perhaps some experience</p></body></html>
