<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2016, 12:27</p><p> </p><p>Hi Carter -- I also have problems going down stairs with my prescription (-25/-26) and have to look straight down through my glasses to see where the steps begin and end.  Holding onto the banister also helps.  Going up is no problem whatsoever.  Your prescription is a lot stronger than mine and perhaps your myodiscs have become quite small.  Mine are 25mm which provides a fairly decent view.  That said, if you feel more comfortable using a white cane then use it, especially at night.  You probably will get used to your new prescription in due course and learn to make some accommodations to it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>CarterC</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2016, 18:15</p><p>I had given getting a white cane some thought a while ago when I missed a step and fell down a flight of stairs, but I am not sure of it. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Danny</b>&nbsp;07 Nov 2016, 11:16</p><p>Doors m, steps and slopes are a huge problem for me. Plus white radiators on a white wall gives me no sense of contrast.  </p><p> </p><p>I was so lucky that my grandad bought me a white cane when I was 8, much that my parent's fury. I did find it amazing that such a simple tool stopped me falling into gaps and it meant that I was able to see where the steps were.  </p><p> </p><p>By the time I was 12 and my grandad had died my parents accepted that a cane was useful but it took two broken arms and a dislocated knee before they accepted that I needed it.  </p><p> </p><p>Carter, I'd recommend that you try but out. Walking into doors is hugely expensive, broken glasses, and painful  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Elliot</b>&nbsp;07 Nov 2016, 10:32</p><p>Carter you will be able to use your vision to your best advantage. If your Rx increases you will adapt to what you are able to see. As lentifan says, everyone bumps into things. </p><p>My vision was similar to yours now when I was a teenager. Thankfully it stabilised in my twenties after further increases. I have never struggled with clarity more image size. As the myos' bowls got smaller the field of view decreased somewhat but not as much as feared as the images got even smaller. The important thing to remember is that your vision will be correctable with glasses. </p><p>Good luck.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;07 Nov 2016, 10:13</p><p>CarterC </p><p> </p><p>Are your difficulties with bumping into things due to low visual acuity or to a restricted field of vision through myodisc lenses? </p><p>Even those of us with good vision can bump into doors, especially if distracted.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>CarterC</b>&nbsp;07 Nov 2016, 06:46</p><p>This loss of visual acuity is actually harder than I thought it would be. I had tripped on things a few times before, but in this last week I have tripped twice ran into someone, and this morning I ran into a door. All this is really making me realize how little vision I have left. It feels like running into that door today made the legally blind news really set in.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2016, 13:48</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hi Danny -- Yours is an inspiring story.  Your myopia alone should have been enough to deal with!  That said, I have a friend who has lost almost all of his eyesight because of retinal problems.  Yet, he gets around quite well with the assistance of his very cool guide dog who is a major ice breaker.  My own myopia is quite severe but still correctable.  Nevertheless, I do know what severe visual limitations are each and every time I take out my contacts or take off my glasses.  I'm grateful for the technical advances that allow me to see reasonably well. I also have to reconcile myself to the fact that other visual problems could emerge as I get older.  Thanks for sharing your story and let us know how you get on.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Danny</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2016, 04:16</p><p>Hello, I'm also severely myopic and registered blind. I think my current prescription is only -35 with -2.5 cylinder and a separate pair with -28 for reading. However, I still need size 36 font to read.  </p><p> </p><p>There are Two reasons why somone becomes legally blind. For me, it was extreme tunnel vision. In have 5degree field in my good eye, which means that if I can see someone's nose then their mouth and eyes are so extremely foggy that it's not useful.  </p><p> </p><p>The other reason is visual actuity. 20/200 means that a blind person would need to stand 20 feet away from something that a sighted person can see at 200 feet. In terms of American Football, this means that if a sighted person is standing on one side of the pitch and can describe what someone on the opposite touchline is wearing, a legally blind person would need to he 6 yards away or less.  </p><p> </p><p>For me, the legal definition of becoming "registered blind" didn't change a thing. I knew that my eyesight was worse than all of my friends. I and they had been used to whispering to me in school what the teacher had written on the board that it was never an issue.  </p><p> </p><p>However, my parents, the school and society made a big issue out of the legal definition. For them, I'd gone from a teenager who had some problems reading to a completely useless person in a single morning. .  </p><p> </p><p>Carter; you will need to decide what definition suits you best.  </p><p> </p><p>For me, being blind is just a label. In the same way that I'm make, I'm left handed, I have red hair; all help society categorise me.  </p><p> </p><p>Now 30 years later, society accepts my skills first, my vision is a minor thing that people have to make adaptations for.  </p><p> </p><p>Plus loads of gadgets that help me around London independently.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>CarterC</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2016, 07:19</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p>I tried the contacts and glasses thing a while ago, but quickly learned contacts are nor for me. I am a junior in high school. I love math and language arts because they are my strongest subjects, but science comes after them. I know some, but would not mind learning more.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2016, 11:52</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hi Cactus Jack -- </p><p> </p><p>First, I'd like to thank you for providing such useful information to eyescene.  It's much appreciated by many members of the group. </p><p> </p><p>I have never considered doing a contact lens/glasses combination because I wear contacts very well and use them exclusively about 90% of the time.  I also have next to no astigmatism which is sometimes difficult to correct with contacts.  I do, however, know of someone with a very high minus who also has a high astigmatism prescription like Carter's.  This fellow wears sphere-only contact lenses (-22, I think) with his -5 astigmatism prescription in his eyeglasses. He swears by it.  The bonus, apart from near perfect vision, is that he can wear very attractive glasses without the cosmetic downside of thick lenses and "small eyes."  It's definitely a very viable option.  Maybe contacts aren't a solution for Carter who might also have keratoconus.  Only a speculation on my part.   </p><p> </p><p>I expect that in Carter's situation, his doctors are awaiting the end of his growth period to see where his eyes might stabilize before considering any alternatives.  At his age, future advances in opthalmology might provide a positive solution to what is a case of exceptional myopia.   </p><p> </p><p>Thanks, again Cactus, for all of your wise counsel. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Baffled</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2016, 06:50</p><p>I haven't the faintest idea  what Carter's so glasses could look like, or him wearing them or functioning with them on...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2016, 19:55</p><p>Patrick B, </p><p>I was very interested in your comment about using CLs to reduce CarterC's need for very high minus glasses.  I have been intrigued for some time with the idea of using CLs to correct a large part of the Sphere in high myopes or hyperopes and putting the rest of the prescription in glasses.   </p><p>I got the idea from reading about a local Ophthalmologist who, while doing the work up for Cataract patients who wear very high prescriptions, uses CLs as part of the process.  Calculating the best IOL power to install during  Cataract Surgery, involves both measuring the dimensions of the eyeball very accurately using ultrasound and doing a refraction. </p><p>Vertex Distance effects can cause significant errors in refraction when a person needs high double digit correction.  He uses CLs of known power to get the patient's vision into a + / - 2 to 3 range, where Vertex Distance is not a factor and he can make very accurate measurements. </p><p>Have you considered correcting say all but a few diopters of your Sphere and putting rest of the Sphere and Cylinder in your glasses? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2016, 19:20</p><p>CarterC, </p><p>Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you.  Thank you for your reply to my questions. It appears that you have been getting some good responses. I tend to analyze vision problems from an Optical Physics and Mathematical point of view. </p><p>I have been thinking about your situation and prescription of: </p><p>OD: Sphere -41.50, Cylinder -5.50, Axis 085  </p><p>OS: Sphere -43.25, Cylinder -4.75, Axis 130 </p><p>As Patrick B said, image minification, because of Vertex Distance effects, make even a corrected image very small on Retina. That, all by itself, can cause significant reduction in Visual Acuity. </p><p>I don't know how far along you are in school.  Or, if you have studied any science subjects in school (or on your own) about optics, vision, and how the eyes work. I also realize that, at 16 you must depend on your parents and  Eye Care Professionals to do their best for your visual needs. </p><p>May I ask a few more questions? </p><p>1. How far along in your education? </p><p>2. How are you in Math and the Sciences? </p><p>3. Do you want to understand more about how your Eyes and Vision work? </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2016, 12:14</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hi Carter -- Thanks for your interesting posts.  I'm also a very high myope (-25/-26) which isn't as serious a prescription as yours but still serious enough to mean that, like you, I really can't function at all without correction.  My prescription tracked yours pretty closely but did pretty much stop changing at -25 when I was in my early twenties.  Glasses give me about 20/40 visual acuity; contact lenses about 20/25/30.  The problem, as I'm sure you've been told, is the tendency of an extreme minus prescription to create images so small (even if clear!) that they cannot be seen.  I suspect that you have reached the 20/200 mark corrected hence your new visual assessment.  I'm sure that your eye care team is taking good care of you.  Have they ever suggested a combination of glasses and contact lenses?  I've finally gone to myodisc lenses since they give me better visual acuity, are lighter, and cosmetically more attractive.  BTW, my cousin's daughter had a very premature son who, at seven, is around -8/-9.  His extreme myopia is a result of his premature birth and the underdevelopment of his eyes while in the womb.  I suspect his myopia will increase during his growth spurt years and could eventually reach the -20s.  In any event, his corrected vision now is excellent.  Keep in touch whenever you have the chance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>CarterC</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2016, 06:41</p><p>Doctors have tried to pinpoint the cause of my extreme myopia, but up to now hvae been unsuccessful. As far as my family knows there is no history of this.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;21 Oct 2016, 05:56</p><p>Thanks Carter for sharing your story and visual history.  While it can be very scary and heartbreaking to see a deterioration in any aspect of one's body, be it vision or anything else, it is especially difficult when it is something that you have no control over.  Have the Drs given you any reason why they suspect your rapid increases in myopia? Does something like this run in you family?  There is an actor named Jon Tyler, who has myopia in the upper -20's who has a male sibling with similar myopia, but 2 other siblings with normal vision, so it is strange how things like this work. Jon has been featured on a couple of blogs so might be a good person to learn more about, and maybe even reach out to, as a means of helping cope with your own situation. You seem to have a very good attitude and spirit and hopefully your reaching out to this site will bring other support and encouragement your way.  Regards, Greg.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>CarterC</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2016, 13:15</p><p>I am 16 years old, and live in America. </p><p>A bit about my visual history: </p><p>I got my first glasses when I was three years old. My right eye was significantly worse, so I had to wear a patch on my left eye to strengthen my right eye. For a while I had semi annual appointments, and always ended up with a stronger prescription. At either six, or seven I started going yearly, and it was the same story. At eight I hit double digits. At eleven I had a larger than usual increase, and the doctor had me start having semi annual appointments. That continued until I was thirteen. At that point my vision was deteriorating too fast for the semi annual appointments, so I started having quarterly appointments. That was also around the point where my prescription hit the negative twenties. At every appointment I remember I have ended up with about about a -1.25 increase. The greatest one I remember was the appointment when I was eleven, that year my increase was -2.75. The next greatest was the one at thirteen tha sparked the quarterly appointments, it was -2.25. Also, when I was five I developed astigmatism, and it too has been gradually getting worse. Other than a retinal detachment when I was thirteen my eyes are, I have not had probelms with my physical eyes. My current prescription is OD: -41.5/-5.5/085 OS: -43.25/-4.75/130.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2016, 01:01</p><p>CarterC, </p><p>That is rough news to hear.  Of all the senses, vision is the most precious.  Sometimes we don't realize how important the senses are, until something goes bad wrong.  The important thing to remember is that human beings are incredibly adaptable and your life is not over.  With effort and a good attitude, you can probably learn to adapt to the situation. </p><p>If there is anything good in this, it is that there are amazing tools that can allow you to make the best of the vision you have.  It is likely that your computer has or can have many aids to make it easier for you to function.   Also, depending on where you live, there are likely many resources to help you.' </p><p>May I ask a few questions? </p><p>1. How old are you? </p><p>2. Where do you live? </p><p>3. Could you tell us a bit about your visual history? </p><p>I am sure I will have more questions, but those are enough for now.  </p><p>I hope that we can be one of those resources I mentioned above.  Our members cover a broad scope of vision related interests with varied backgrounds.  A few of our members are Eye Care Professionals (ECPs).  I am not.  My background is Electronic and Computer Engineering (problem Solving).  My knowledge about vision and optics comes from my education and dealing with my own vision problems.  None as significant as yours. </p><p>Be sure and take the comments, here, with a "grain of salt".  Your local ECPs have the best possible knowledge about your situation, but may not have time to answer your questions or just chat with you about your situation.  We can do the latter, if nothing else. </p><p>Welcome. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>CarterC</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2016, 20:05</p><p>It now seems like I am officially part of this low vision group. I have been gradually loosing my eyesight my whole life. Today I went into my appointment as a high myope, and came out as legally blind. In my gut I always knew that this day was inevitable, but being here is surreal. When I heard the words, I felt my heart drop. This all so new, and I cannot stop thinking about what this means. What now, for me? The more I contemplate this situation, the more questions circulate in my head, and the more anxious I get. I found this site about half a year ago, and up until now have been a reader. Thought there is no better day than today to write my post. I felt sharing this recent development might help me get through the news.</p><p></p><hr>

I loved that more than anything else.  </p><p>  </p><p>I told my daddy that if I have to, I won't to go to any other "Eyes Treatment thing" ever again. I am almost 18 and I am okay the way I am so it is okay for me. They say that because the difference for looking close and looking far is too big, there is a gap where my eyes don't work at all. I can tell you I see no difference and I told that to the team UCLA and to those guys in England, but they affirm this is where all my problems lay. They suggested a new pair of eyeglasses, but on "trying them almost two weeks as experience" I simply couldn't make them "work" at all and I think that every now and then I felt very uncomfortable with them. We leave them, (the doctors) I mean, still trying to figure out what to do. </p><p>  </p><p>I had to stay "off" glasses for over 8 hours slatted in two days for "precise" measurements of my eyes and the extension and strength of a weirdo nystagmus that all of sudden began to show over the time with more frequencies really impairing me. I hope nobody here has it, this thing is really annoying beyond anything else, and it is THIS nystagmus that is ruining my life and puts me into visually impaired classification. I hate this stigma ARGH. </p><p>  </p><p>Please understand you guy and bear in mind I am not complaining, it is just a need to throw it out. If things goes out of control I might be in serious problem in the future. </p><p>  </p><p>I regretted I didn't take a notebook with me so I had to use all my daddy's stuffs and I hate when he says... "Didn't I tell you this or that? Ugh. So I spare him from that. I am crazy about video games and computers so I took the chance and bought several computer parts to that I am assembling a "fuck... real MONSTER" if things goes Ok.  </p><p> </p><p>I got an Intel i7 930 Processor AND an ATI HD5870 2GB DDR5 EYEFINITY 6 EDITION SHAPPIRE Video card, with amazing 6 HDMI outputs.

<p><b>Ryan O'C</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2010, 13:08</p><p>I agree with Cactus about low vision &amp; prescriptions.  My little sister (14) has the lowest Rx in the family at -12, but the worst vision at 20/150 corrected.  Kate lost an eye due to cancer when she was little, and the radiation treatments affected the other eye.  Stronger glassses do her no good. </p><p>Fortunately, she is not affected by the poor hearing shared by the rest of the family, siblings and parents.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;19 Jul 2010, 09:24</p><p>boy22, </p><p>Low vision and a very high Rx are not directly related to one another, but it is not uncommon for a person who needs a very high Rx to also have low vision. </p><p>The eyes are biological cameras and the purpose of glasses of any strength is to correct a mismatch between the optical power of the lens system of the eye and the length of the eyeball. </p><p>The "film" or "image sensor" in this biological camera is the retina which is actually part of the brain.  If there are problems with the retina, optic nerve, or visual cortex.

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2010, 20:33</p><p>Hi Wei... and everybody. </p><p> </p><p>How to define of low vision? I believe low Vision definition is different in several Countries. I hate that definition but I can not avoid it. I dont understand exactly how strabismus affects me but to me it has nothing to do with aphakia.  </p><p> </p><p>Actually, aphakia is the absence of the crystalline lenses inside your eyes. I was born without it, but usually crystalline lenses are removed from the eyes as I understand it, when they turn into cataract, or when that lens of the eye becomes clouded sorry I can only guess. </p><p> </p><p>I am not sure I fully understand you.,. sorry again </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Anderson.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;04 Oct 2009, 14:02</p><p>Hello you guys... I just don't this site that often. </p><p> </p><p>I am sorry I forget to name my last posting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>You may not know, but I am an adopted boy with some eyes issues like CFEOM strabismus mixed with bilateral Duane Syndrome and my daddy really does his help me. After 3 years he still thinks great of the Moorefield's Eye Hospital and the Queen Mary University both in London and this is the 3rd years I go to there for treatment. Daddy really believes Moorefield is one of the bests Hospital in the World so I go there for eyes CFEOM studies and treatment. There I learned Duane syndrome is a variety of this Congenital Fibrosis of Extraocular Muscles. I truly don't give a shit about it as that doesn't change my bilateral Duane Syndrome condition nor my stupid and now "Bizarre" strabismus, as my muscle eyes are actually badly stiffed and those Stem cells thing soundly failed.  </p><p> </p><p>But it was there, in England, I got my new glasses and they are a bit stronger and they were assembled differently that gives them an appearance of a bit thinner. </p><p> </p><p>Those lenses, over +32:00  were made by Carl Zeiss laboratories with a small conventional 15 Base Out prisms blocks and then were added over  +13:00 Press On bottom Optical lenses from the same Carl Zeiss laboratory and only later the 35 Prisms as BO Press-On prisms by Zeiss Company was added. Both glasses looks beautiful and precious pieces. I've learned they were real difficult to be confectioned and required some skilled hands to be beautifully made. </p><p> </p><p>I had eyes surgeries last July at Moorefield, for correcting that nasty strabismus, but that apparently didn't work. I sworn my daddy I wouldn't complain anymore about this eyes shitty. But after last July when my eyes treatment really got weirdo just after the strabismus two surgeries and after I got steam cells that screwed me up I am real sick. Not that I am complaining but I am really sad because my school restarted two weeks later in August and now I'm having fucking Saturdays school classroom, and I still feel weird... Only the whole shit seems not working at all and I am sad and I shouldn't be because I'm still can play and I'm just returning from my futsal soccer game. </p><p> </p><p>I hate school more than anything, because school sucks.... I am fed up with bullying and things and now, having to go to school by Saturday is nearly driving me mad and I look desperately for any excuses for not going to.  </p><p> </p><p>Hopefully I will finish school this year and I'll stop going to school... Hopefully I'll get some job as I'm nearly 18 and nobody will stops me from getting job, and IF that happens... MAN, OH MAN, I'll find a place I can pay for me to sleep and eat and I'll call it my own. </p><p> </p><p>That will be a dream coming true. MY OWN PLACE. </p><p> </p><p>Sorry I'm bothering you all with this shit. </p><p> </p><p>Tchau you guys</p><p></p><hr>

Welcome to this very interesting site. </p><p> </p><p>Only very recently Ive been said to be Sub Vision here in Brazil, thou I dont know what difference it makes. Funnily enough Ive been denied or not accepted in many situations till I prove I am apt to perform what is required. Also, only recently Ive found out that there are Huge difference on how a person sees and how I do see myself. And I can only realize those things throughout my soccers players peers. It is like they are more prone to know more about my eyes things and how I go about and how come I am such a heck of Goalkeeper. </p><p> </p><p>BTW Last week, on Doctor visiting I learned that thanks to my overcorrected glasses, I will buy myself some time as far as I can hold my eyes still.  </p><p> </p><p>Ive been said that because of eyes condition doctors will have to my eyes profiles send to Welfare Services as Sub Vision classified, due to my limited peripheral vision. But Im curious here. In fact, Id never heard that strabismus or farsighted could lead to that as I am up to 20/40 on good days and I am 20/80 corrected and I am over 20/1000 n/c, whatever those numbers means. </p><p> </p><p>Again, welcome </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4eyes from São Paulo.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2006, 10:05</p><p>Hey folks, I found an Edgar Cayce overview on and possible treatments for blindness.  Be warned:  It's a lot of reading.  I can't fit all the text in this post, so if you'd like the full text, or just have questions/concerns, feel free to e-mail me at Lorenzorgz@gmail.com </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Health and Rejuvenation Center </p><p>Cayce Health Database </p><p>  </p><p> </p><p>OVERVIEW OF BLINDNESS </p><p> </p><p>Preview </p><p> </p><p>     According to the Cayce readings, the essential work of the blind person is to develop the deeper insight which will lead to a better outlook.  "Awaken more the vision from within, that may add to the moral forces, the spiritual activities, the lightening from within that may bring to self and to those whom the entity may contact that which will make for an experience, a life, worthwhile."  (447-1) </p><p>     The temporarily sightless man or woman begins the path to restoration of vision and, more importantly, to transformation and healing with the remembrance that, "These necessitate, then, that preparation be made in the body for the reception of, for the activity of, the divine within the body, the mind of the entity.... Prepare self in mind -- regardless of time." (3504-1) </p><p>     The profound challenge of blindness, which afflicts millions of people, calls out loudly for the "patience, persistence, and consistency" which are hallmarks of the Cayce health readings. Meeting such a condition as blindness, especially when karmic or prenatal in origin, requires long periods of preparation and application, plus attitudinal and life changes. "Let's make haste slowly, and not overstress the correction in vision. Let's make the changes as a growth, and the using of what is obtained in a better or more constructive manner - this will be better than attempting to hasten same." (1861-10) </p><p>     Facing the loss of sight mandates the facing of self. "For while each soul is in the flesh there is a constant meeting of same." (1385-1) Yet viewed through the compassionate perspective of Cayce, this challenge can be recognized as a real opportunity to discover the inner Divinity, else "If they who seek or labor are not directed by Him, they seek or labor in vain." (841-1) </p><p> </p><p>A Case </p><p> </p><p>     One who apparently labored not in vain was Mr. 1861, for whom 19 readings spread over 5 1/2 years were given. A violinist and teacher of music, Mr. 1861 first consulted Edgar Cayce in 1939 at the age of 33.  His vision problems arose shortly after a premature birth as an eruptive phenomenon associated with cold and congestion. Almost total blindness ensued until age four when he had a series of operations in which the cataracts in his eyes were repeatedly "needled." He was then fitted with high power telescopic glasses which allowed him to read at a distance of three inches. </p><p>     When Cayce's work came to his attention via a radio program, Mr. 1861 immediately applied for a physical reading.  It outlined dietary recommendations, osteopathic adjustments and electrotherapy. These suggestions were augmented over the years with other remedies and most significantly through further Cayce readings which delved into the deeper aspects of Mr.1861's blindness and life. </p><p>      In a statement written in 1943, Mr. 1861 acknowledged the greater help he and his wife received as a result of Life and Mental-Spiritual readings</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melanie</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2006, 12:02</p><p>Cactus: </p><p>Thank you for your kind offer, but I am probably too far gone at this point. </p><p>My prescriiption is R +11.50 +3.00 x40 L +12.00 +2.75 x10 add +3.50 w/trifocals.  My first glasses were +8 when I was 2.  I got +1.00 bifocals when I was 10 and trifocals when I was 15.  With glasses I see about 20/80, and can't see much very well beyond 10 feet.  My central vision is 40 deg. in my right eye and 25 deg in the left.  Most of the time my left eye is occluded because I have bad diplopia and can't fuse the images.  When I am away from home, I use a white cane for identification and to find things that are outside the tunnel. </p><p>The boys do wear glasses.  They must help because they ask for them when they don't have them on.  Matt used to have +16, now has +14 with a +2 bifocal.  Mike used to have +17, now has +15 with a +2 bifocal.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2006, 20:42</p><p>Concerned Parent: The comments regarding the urgency of preventing ambylopia are correct.  As I understand amblyopia, during the early years (until about age 6), the visual cortex in the brain is still developing and it does best when high quality images are supplied from each eye.  Under certain circumstances, particularly where the image from one eye is significantly better than the image from the other, that portion of the visual cortex serving the weak eye will not develop properly and at some point, the brain will cut off the weak eye and vision in that eye will never be possible. </p><p>Please get her to a teaching hospital with a very good opthalmology department. </p><p>I don't recall if you have mentioned where you live.  Perhaps some members could suggest some possibilities or even help with a referral. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>--</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2006, 11:46</p><p>Concerned parent needs o be brought to a point where he is satisfied with the diagnosis but its clear that this poor kid really needs glasses now! Its not surprising that she would reject the earlier glasses - many kids do. Its also possible that there is an element of wishful thinking here on c-ps part. </p><p> </p><p>One thought- the 2 different prescriptions may actually not be as different as cp thinks - if the astigmatism is expressed as minus in the first -6 prescription and as plus in the -11 prescription then they may not be so far apart.  </p><p> </p><p>But I can not stress the need for getting this child to a major teaching facility pronto! Is there a childrens hospital near you?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2006, 11:39</p><p>That's a good point about amblyopia (which I have myself, with the result that one eye has been effectively useless for most of my life). It's something to be corrected early if at all possible. I'm inclined to agree with Emily that it has to be worth a try.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2006, 11:34</p><p>I just don't see what harm it could do to fill the eye doctor's prescription and try it for a month.  Let her be examined with the prescription that he recommends, and make an adjustment at that time if necessary.

<p><b>--</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2006, 10:41</p><p>presbyopia_23, the reason to give concerned parent's daughter glasses now is to avoid amblyiopia - a condition where an eye wll atrophy if it does not get good visual response. This is a poptentially serioous sight threatening problem. By 5 or 6 it is too late. Please be careful about advising people when you are not an expert in the problem, especially when it comes to small children. </p><p> </p><p>Concerned parent. Please get your daughter to a major teaching hospital immediately! There is something terribly wrong here with how the treatment of your daughter is going. Please!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>presbyopia_23</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2006, 10:00</p><p>concerned parent, why bother giving her glasses now? This will just make her eyes worse. If shes 20/60 shes only around a -2 because a -11 would be about 20/1500 as the doctor said. Your optican wouldnt even fill the pescription because he knows they are way too strong. Maybe wait till she gets older and goes to school then she can get weak glasses to see the chalkboard. Right now theres NO reason for glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2006, 05:46</p><p>Guest:  Yes, trifocals, but not always. I didn't mention that I have some astigmatism because it was not importatant at the time. My complete Rx is: </p><p>OD -1.25, -0.25 x 90 </p><p>OS +0.25, -1.25 x 75 </p><p>with some prism and the above mentioned trifocals. </p><p>The intent was, after the surgery, to be able to function without glasses if I needed to, such as gettting up at night, reading a medicine bottle etc.  With the astigmatism, small print is a little fuzzy w/o glasses. </p><p>Also, with my natural lenses removed and IOLs replacing them, I have no ability to focus, but the trifocals take care of that. </p><p>I had a retinal exam Thursday with visual fields and pressure checks.  The results were very good, no retinal damage (I've had well controlled Type 2 diabetes for nearly 40 years, eye pressures were low, and vision with glasses was an easy 20/20 with some letters on the 20/15 line.   </p><p>Isn't it wonderful to live in a time when all these physical problems can be managed or corrected?  Imagine what the future holds. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2006, 22:13</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p>Wth your new prescription do you still have to wear glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2006, 20:34</p><p>Concerned Parent: There may be another way to verify your daughter's refractive error.  The procedure is normally used to measure the internal dimensions of the eye and calculate the power of the intraocular lens to be used to replace the natural crystaline lens before cataract surgery.  I have had cataract surgery and it is amazingly acurate.  My post surgery Rx is within 0.25 diopters of the planned value. </p><p>The measurements are made using ultrasound and they are essentially quick and painless.  The insturment provides the dimensions of the cornea, the crystalene lens, and the distance from the lens to the retina.  Using these measurements, they are able to claculate the required power of the replacement lens to provide the desired Rx.   </p><p>In my case, I was L -4.25, R -2.50 and now I'm L +0.25, R -1.25.  We were shooting for L 0.00, R -1.50. </p><p>It would seem to me that they should be able to measure your daughter's eyes, calculate their refractive power and calculate the approximate corrective glasses Rx to within 1 or 2 diopters.  That way, you would know about what the refracted glasses Rx ought to be. </p><p>While the test is quick and painless, I doubt a 3 year old could be still enough without sedation to allow it.  For the test to be accurate, the ultrasound probe must just barely touch the cornea even the slightest pressure or motion will cause the measurements to be off. </p><p>Hope this suggetion is useful. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>concerned parent</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2006, 14:28</p><p>i posted this question on another thread and received good information. i have a daughter that is almost three and an opthalmologist recently advised us she is -11.50 in both eyes with a pretty bad astigmatism. the problem we are having is that when he tested her with the eyecharts she is consistently reading the 20/60 line. the doctor and others at the office were impressed with this and could not explain it. he still prescribed the eyeglasses because the retinoscope still was showing severe myopia. i have concerns with attempting to put strong glasses on her when she seems to see well. when i went to get the glasses at a local optometrist office he did not want to fill the perscription when he saw how my daughter saw a small mickey mouse doll from across the room. when i told him about the vision chart he even questioned it more. i know that children can accomodate more than adults with vision but when you are about 20/1500 you will not see the 20/60 line(even the doctor agreed). we constantly have been testing my daughter and have noticed no issues. my wife is a -2.00 and my daughter can see things my wife can not. has anyone else had a child with a similar situation? i am nervous when the doctors admit they have not seen this before but still want her to wear a  </p><p>-11.50 glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

A few years ago, before my mother had that lasik surgery, she was very myopic. In the strength it was mention in, they use degrees and both her eyes were about 1000 degrees. Not sure how that is measure in diopters or whatever units is standard. I'm guessing about -10. Someone had mentioned to her that she might be able to qualify for a disabled parking placard because of her vision. Obviously she can't now, but does anyone know if it was true? As far as the state laws go, we live in the state of California. Is there anyone out there, especially any eye doctors, that know how poor one's vision has to be to qualify for the disabled parking placard?</p><p></p><hr>

But getting bifocals is something that everyone will have to deal with eventually, some in their 30s, some people not until their 50s or 60s.  But I did not say anything about Cathy's age! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;01 Oct 2004, 00:31</p><p>Cathy, Curt is wrong to suggest that your eyesight is affected by age: you are far too young for presbyopia. </p><p>I just wonder why you need bifocals. I do not think you would be prescribed them in the UK. Surely all that is needed to compensate for having an eyeball of the wrong diameter are single vision lenses. However, if I am wrong, are there alternatives? If bifocals worry you, what about progressive lenses, or contact lenses for distance with reading specs: you could get a cool, trendy pair that you could see over without looking "old". </p><p>But, whatever lenses you end up with, just remember that glasses enhance a woman's appeal. Go for thin lenses and nice frames and enjoy wearing them. I bet the longest queue will be at your desk! I would certainly join it.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2004, 05:35</p><p>Cathy: Regarding your statement: "these glasses have made my eyes so bad" --- glasses cannot and do not make your eyes any worse.  You were probably straining to see well before (especially up close).  The glasses that you were given have relaxed the muscles that control your focusing, and so now they are not straining anymore.  To you, it seems like the glasses have made your eyes worse and that you have become totally dependent on them.  In reality, you needed them all along - it is now just more obvious. </p><p> </p><p>Your prescription is quite similar to mine, and I reached a point where I can't go without my glasses several years ago.  It is no fun becoming dependent on glasses for everything, but it is also a real drag to not be able to see clearly! </p><p> </p><p>As they say, "Growing old sucks, but it sure beats the alternative!" </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2004, 03:18</p><p>David, I am not 50 nor gay nor living in US, but I can second everything you said about TV. And the wise words about Big Brother - wow! You hit the nail! </p><p> </p><p>In Czech TV, there are 4 whole area TV stations, some regional ones, and a few distributed by cable, women and men in glasses are probably more frequent that in american TVs. Some of the news people wear glasses, (one woman per channel at least) Characters in Czech movies wear glasses usually without following the old stupid scheme "ugly duckling -&gt; beautiful swan". I can watch some German TVs too, where glasses do not seem to be a socail stigma at all. So, I think that central European culture gets rather different attitude towards glasses. However "our" Big Brother" is the same idiot monster as your one.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David_Llewellyn</b>&nbsp;27 Aug 2004, 23:19</p><p>Puffin: to tell you the truth, I watch very little TV (since it seems entirely oriented towards people not of my generation, interests, style, etc. (I mean, like how many 50 year old, gay, bicycle-riding, transit-using, long-haired guys with thick round glasses do you have on TV anyway!!! In fact, taking any ONE of those attributes cuts us down to zero right away, right?) so I couldn't really speak to your issue. In movies at least, women wear glasses usually at the beginning of the movie, so they can have a "makeover" and convert into kick-ass, gun-toting types later on. Men occasionally do as well (e.g. Indiana Jones wears fake glasses in the classroom, but not outside of it). But few men do in movies as well. </p><p>In, for example, "Spider-Man 1", when you first see the head scientist employed by the villain, I turned to my partner and said "He (the scientist) is toast". My partner replied "How did you know"? And I said "1st, he's wearing glasses. 2nd, he's bald, but not a skinhead. 3rd, he's creating the monster, altho unwillingly, and an absolute hollywood rule is "Frankenstein's Law", that he who creates a monster must die by the monster.". 10 seconds later, Scientist Fu. </p><p>I wear -9, 10mm-thick glasses while being thrown in my martial art! And I do it for real, not the phony stuff in the movies. </p><p>Remember that what's on TV and in (American) movies is purely there for lifestyle-indoctrination. As my partner put it: "Big-Brother isn't watching you. You're watching Big-Brother". </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;27 Aug 2004, 17:44</p><p>This is true. I have seen many glasses ads with "beautiful people" apparently wearing glasses with no strength in the lenses - obviously fake. These days it's possible to hide some small prescriptions in something that looks almost like no prescription - but still these ads go the whole hog in fakery. What's the point of that? People would not buy glasses if they had the perfect vision the ad wearers seem to have. </p><p> </p><p>Tell you something else. It's still much rarer to see women on TV with glasses than men. Usually it's used as a sort of code for "she's clever". A bit pathetic, really. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David_Llewellyn</b>&nbsp;27 Aug 2004, 16:43</p><p>Hi All! I was interested in the comments about discrimination against eyeglass-wearers. This is endemic, and most tellingly... in optical advertising! Try opening the phone book to the "opticians" section, for example, and you will note that not a single ad shows any visible Rxs in the various images of people wearing glasses. </p><p>In the USA, the Americans with Disabilities Act requires companies to make "reasonable" accomodations for various disabilities. But it has been held that once you correct your vision with glasses, you are no longer disabled, therefore you can be discriminated against. Cool, eh?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pauline</b>&nbsp;26 Aug 2004, 08:01</p><p>Puffin. My spare pair that i carry around in my handbag has the standard lenses in them, hence they are quite thick.

<p><b>Pauline</b>&nbsp;24 Aug 2004, 01:51</p><p>Ree. No, quite comfortable reading small print at the moment without the need for bifocals. My optician did say this would come with time, but hopefully not for quite a few years yet. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2004, 16:58</p><p>It is easy to confuse names around her Pauline, I do it all the time.  Well, that is a bit stronger prescription than I thought you might be at now.  I figured around -7 or -8, which would still qualify as highly myopic.  I know that -9.00R and -10.75L is bad enough that you can't even do close work without your glasses. You basically went from -1 or so at 17 to -10.75 at age 27. That is definately a lot of myopia in ten years, especially since this mostly happened after the "experts" suggest that myopia should not increase much.  I am pleased to hear that your changes have stopped. </p><p> </p><p>Although, with the small lens sizes that are popular now, and with the right hi index lenses, you, and your glasses will definately be attractive to the right person.  If you are still looking, good luck.  I know I love to see a pair of glasses on a pretty lady where the power of the lenses is hidden, but there if you look for it. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2004, 13:15</p><p>Cathy: If it is any consolation, I got my first bifocals at 27.  I see teenagers and college students wearing them, so I has little to do with age.   </p><p> </p><p>You were prescribed bifocals because they made the most sense for you based on your job.  You need a weak + lens for distance (the +0.75 part), and a stronger lens to see close up (the +2.0 add).  Your other options would have been single vision reading glasses (which would make everything far away very blurry - try looking at something far away through your bifocal and you will see what I mean), or half frame glasses (which, in my opinion, make people look MUCH older than bifocals do).  Bifocals have to do with function, not age.  If you had single vision reading glasses, you would be constantly removing them everytime you needed to look at something in the distance --- not very practical! </p><p> </p><p>Since these are your first glasses, I would try wearing them for 1-2 weeks before going back or anything like that.  You will likely find that your distance vision will get clearer with each passing day, and within a week or so it will be crystal clear. </p><p> </p><p>But don't get freaked out about having bifocals.  As you said in an earlier post, unless you tell someone, they may not even notice. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

I must say that your Rx is quite strong especially for a lady who  got an Rx when she was in her teens.  It seems to have been quite a steady progression of your myopia.  I sympathise with what you had to undergo and agree that theatre/stage and showbiz are places which unfortunately have a negative attitude towards glasses.  I also congradulate you on having got over it and made a successful carreer for yourself. </p><p>   Yes it is always wise to carry a spare pair with you for any eventuality. </p><p>   I guess now you must be around 30,  and would like to know whether you are comfortable reading or have been advised bifocals.</p><p></p><hr>

Im so happy that you looked at the positive side of life &amp; started a new successful career.
2year ago i had a crush on a girl and believe me, she &amp; both her sisters wear glasses with more than -5! Just imagine three similar statues in a row with spex, thats how those3 looked.But sadly, they left for USA for higher studies.
Take care and please update us on about hapennings which relates to your glasses.
Ree,
when i consider the situation in my country,(sri lanka) i can see some girls with glasses in front offices such as at HONGKONG &amp; SHANGHAI BANK (where almost 25percent wear glasses)..
Hmm.. I wish the trend will continue.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pauline</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2004, 07:55</p><p>Ree. Sorry did not see that add on on your last post ref contact lenses. Was told was not a suitable candidate for them.

<p><b>Pauline.</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2004, 07:31</p><p>Specs4ever. Sorry, addressed it to specsaver instead of specs4ever. I apologise.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2004, 07:29</p><p>Point taken, Ree. My friend had to change out of contacts and wear his glasses for a few days before his medical exam, and clearly there were fairly searchng questions about vision and correction. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pauline</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2004, 07:27</p><p>specsaver. Have not kept copies of them, but I think you are correct, the prescription was in the region of -1 or -1.50. Again, I dont have a copy of the next one, but remember being upset because the optician said my short sight had progressed quite badly, and the new lenses needed were over double that of my original prescription. Thats when I really began to wear them more. This prescription as far as I remember lasted about 18months. When I went for my next test,again there was quite a substantial change. Wish I had kept all these of these prescriptions then could give you a more accurate account. I do remember being very upset at how thick they were and stood out from the frame. By now, there was no option of not wearing them, so shortly after left the job. By that time, I could bump into someone before I saw them. Can be more helpful now, because have found a copy of prescription dated Oct 97, I was then 23 years old. The form reads, R-6.50 L-7.25. I was nearly 27 before the progression of my short sight ceased. Final prescription, which is what I still have today is what I call very strong, (It is to me) It reads R-9.00 R-10.75.  Thank goodness for high index lenses, they at least disguise the thickness of the lenses, but even so, my eyes look very small when I look in the mirror. I have 3 sisters; they and my parents all have perfect eyesight.  So specsaver , thats what I call highly myopic. I always carry a spare pair in my handbag, because if anything happened to them, I really am as blind as a bat. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ree</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2004, 07:19</p><p> Julian,  technically what you have said is right.  But this chap was trying to get into Merchant navy,  and I doubt whether he has mentioned in his form that he had lasik.  So as long as they dont know, it means that he has had good eyesight all along. </p><p>    Pauline,  read your post with interest and was sorry to learn that  you were a victim of this trend,  anyway why did you not switch over to contact lenses and thus continued with your dancing carreer.  Also i was curious to know what was your Rx when you had to quit dancing and what is it now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2004, 07:09</p><p>Pauline what's your RX now?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2004, 06:46</p><p>Ree: interesting what you say about a guy having LASIK so as to join the Merchant Navy. A friend of mine joined the (UK) army a couple of years ago, and told me anybody who'd had LASIK wuld be rejected out of hand as it leaves the corneas too thin. He was in the habit of wearing contacts but has had to revert to glasses most of the time because of his working conditions (he's a pharmacist). </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2004, 06:01</p><p>Pauline, the progression of myopia is fascinating to me.  Usually, a young person gets their first glasses anywhere from 13 to 15. Then the myopic progression occurs fairly rapidly until around the early 20's, when it levels off.  This is according to the basics that the eye doctors go on. </p><p>You were only slightly shortsighted at 17, so I would assume that you were around -1,00D, Then by 19 you felt that you needed your glasses fulltime, probably around a -2D prescription.  By the time your 21's birthday came around you were double that - likely around -4D.  Now at age 30, you describe yourself as highly myopic. Do you mind telling me what you consider highly nyopic?  Are my guesses about right for your prescriptions? </p><p>This is not as unusual as the doctors like to let their patients think it is.  Myopia can keep increasing into  </p><p>the 30's and 40's.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ree</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2004, 03:49</p><p>   Pauline is absolutely right.   Said or unsaid these things have been going on for years and nothing is being done about it, as it is very difficult to prove this , maybe in a court of law or elsewhere.  </p><p>   Even companies  do not like to hire their marketing personels and Public relations officers ,  hotels their receptionists, people with  high Rxs and thus consequently thick glasses. They may not say it so in as many words, but they have a policy in place. </p><p> Recently my friend who was aspiring to join the merchant Navy had lasik, but i think that is understanble as he will be subjected to rigorous activity in the ship.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2004, 03:04</p><p>Much as I prefer glasses, even on women, I'd have thought that for dancers, flight attendants &amp;c;, contacts were the obvious solution for those who can tolerate them. LASIK is drastic, and dangerous IMHO. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pauline</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2004, 02:14</p><p>Read with interest the posts ref being penalised for wearing glasses. This has been going on for years, but to try to prove this is another thing. Im nearly 30 now, but in my late teens was selected to be part of a dance team who were used quite often as a backing group for various local shows and the occasional variety show at the theatre. </p><p>When I started the job, I was just 17, and slightly short sighted. But found no problem coping with the routine without my glasses. I did not wear them full time. As time progressed my eyesight deteriorated. At 19  I started having difficulty in seeing, even with my glasses on. A visit to the optician confirmed that stronger glasses were needed. These I got and really found the need to wear them full time. I still managed to do the dancing with out any glasses, but was getting more difficult to spot the input signals for various routines. I struggled on like this for another 18months before I realised I was missing inputs and getting things wrong. Another visit to my optician confirmed that my eyesight had changed to a considerable amount.  My new glasses were nearly twice the prescription of my old ones. I realised that once I began wearing these, there would be no way that I would manage at work without them. You might think as I did, what does it matter of one of the dancing group is wearing glasses. This was not the case, was told in no uncertain terms, get contact lenses, manage without your glasses or get a new job. (Not lots of legal requirements then for employment rights). I did manage to stay with the team for about 2 months, then had to leave, I just could not see half what was going on. I was allowed to wear them in rehearsals, but not during the live shows. Now I work for a multi company doing PR work. Am also very myopic now, but having to wear very strong glasses does not hold me back in my present job.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

One of the leading ophthalmologists here who does laisk has told that most of his patients undergoing this procedure are young ladies who are aspiring to be Air Hostesses, Models and and prospective brides. It is also true that these Air Hostess have a very short carrer span in the air, when they are 40 plus they are grounded and accomodated in the ground staff. </p><p>   It is also true that i have noticed many times these ladies wearing glasses as they are checking out of the airport,   but when i had seen in the flight they were without glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2004, 08:05</p><p>Back in the days when flight attendants were called stewardesses, I believe several airlines did have rules prohibiting them from wearing glasses.

<p><b>Ree</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2004, 07:24</p><p>   Good thing cathy you went in for glasses.  Its is definitely better glasses rather than stretchin your arms trying to read and thus making more obvious that you are having visual problems or are fighting age in vain.  Agreed that you are a bit young to be prescribed bifocals,, but once you have got them,, better to acept them happily. </p><p>   One qustion that I would like to ask is that since Airlines are very conscious about the appearance of their inflight staff,, is there any clause anywhere in your contract which says that you should not wear glases ,, or what is the policy which airlines follow when they recruit stwerds esp those who have to wear glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kerrie</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2004, 06:28</p><p>Hi all. Thanks for suggestions re high index lenses. When i get my final perscription, thats what i will be going for. Until then will have to get by with the thickness. Have got quite used to my new glasses now, event the distant vision is beginning to become really clear. A few of my friends noticed the extra thickness and magnification, but others did not. I'm sure if i had not got a thicker frame, it would have noticed a lot more. I have had my new perscription put into my old frames, so a spare pair is available. The lenses stick out quite a large amount. I still have a slight hangup about the magnification of my eyes, but slowly getting there. My friend tried them on, and her eyes seemed to me to look really big, but she has large eyes anyway (and good eyesight) Still unable to go without them for any length of time, in fact as soon as i take them off, i can feel the eyes pulling. Post again in a few weeks let you know how things are. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cathy</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2004, 06:23</p><p>I took the plunge. I went and got glasses yeserday. The minute I put them on, I knew I could never go back. I spent the day putting them on and taking them off. What a difference! </p><p>Last night at dinner my friend noticed that I didn't move the menu away from eyes to read. She said she noticed me doing it recently but never said anything.I am worried though later that night I took them off and went to read my watch but it was very blurry putting my specs back on it was crystal clear. How can that be after just one day. Now I am really worried.The line in my new glasses is very pronounced I can really tell,However my friend says she would not have noticed if I did not tell her.Will my get worse from wearing these glasses I got FT 35 bifocals,the at the optical place said they would give me  a larger area to read. I think that made the line worse. My friend has a smaller bifocal and it is harder to tell that they are bifocals. BTW she is only 35.Tommorrow will be the big test I have a flight early AM.

<p><b>Krys</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2004, 14:56</p><p>Kerrie, So happy to hear that you are more comfortable with your new glasses.  Like we've said, no one will really notice any differences except the most important person-YOU- and that is the fact that you can see better with the new lenses.  Even when you get new stronger ones, it will be the same thing!  My daughter's prescription is different in each eye and initially one lens would be thicker than the other.  Even though it cannot change the strength or magnification of the lenses, we ask that the weaker lens be made up to the same thickness as the stronger lens.  At first the optician thought we were nuts to ask for thicker glasses, but soon understood our reasons for it.  Mostly cosmetic reasons, to keep the lenses balanced looking.  Her eyes are still changing so we have not looked into special lenses that are thinner or less magnified yet but will consider that in the future.  Like I mentioned previously, while she isn't always initially happy with the suggestion that she needs stronger glasses, it only takes a short amount of time when she puts them on for her to be thrilled with them, even when she got bifocals.  Keep up the good work, and please continue to give us updates!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2004, 07:33</p><p>Kerrie, I hope this page will be of some benifit to you. Don't worry about your new Rx. You will do fine with your new eyewear. </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161114212843/http://www.allaboutvision.com/lenses/aspheric-lenses.htm" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutvision.com/lenses/aspheric-lenses.htm</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Henry_c</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2004, 07:20</p><p>Kerrie:  </p><p>If the thickness and magnification disturbs you maybe you should consider hi-index lenses. Aspheric ones offer help there.  </p><p>It's worth checking out in any case. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kerrie</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2004, 01:00</p><p>Julian, Puffin and Kris, Have calmed down now since last night. I have found great encouragement reading all your posts, particularly the one from Kris.  Yes Julian, the optician did mention that my eyes are more relaxed thats why I need more correction and am working to the final strength for my lenses. When I got my new glasses yesterday, I thought everyone would see how thick they were. Kris was correct, my best friend did not notice, never even noticed the frames were different until I prompted her by saying could she see any difference in my glasses. All she said was you have changed your frames. When I informed her about the big jump in my prescription, she admitted that she could not see any difference whatsoever. This pleased me more than you will ever know.  The close vision is perfect as is middle distance. Watching the TV , the picture is back to being crisp and sharp. Distance a bit hazy, but not as bad as when I got my first pair of glasses. The magnification does look quite bad to me, more so in my bad eye, but Im grown up enough to realise that there is nothing that can be done about that. What is quite different is the thickness when you look at them from the side. There is quite a large difference between the two lenses. One thing, my mum cannot borrow mine now when she mislays her reading glasses, she tried mine on last night and admitted that she could not see anything; the print was all out of focus. If she put the paper about 5 inches from her face, she could just about see it. Sorry to have gone on so long, but as I said, Im old enough to know, I need to wear glasses full time, probably for the rest of my life, and there is every chance they are going to get stronger. Im going to accept this fact. Think for my next boyfriend will find one who wears glasses, we can discuss out eyesight together</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2004, 23:10</p><p>Kerrie: the question abut your eyes changing. Didn't the optician explain the only change in your eyes since June is that they have learned to relax so that you can see with a bit more of the correction you have needed all along? Long sight is different from short sigts of other people) you have spent years straining to see and it takes your eyes time to learn not to strain. Honestly, not many people notice much about other people's glasses; just enjoy the good vision, and enjoy not having thos headaches! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2004, 15:19</p><p>I might add also that most people aren't interested in the finer details of glasses etc. The biggest step was starting to wear glasses - thicker ones aren't so big a step as that.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2004, 12:42</p><p>I meant to conclude my message with let us know how you come along, not alone.  thank you, Krys</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Krys</b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2004, 12:24</p><p>Hi Kerrie,  </p><p>I posted previously about my daughter who is about the same age as you. (I didn't put my name, however, sorry.)  She has experienced the same feelings as you when she would get her new glasses, because they would be thicker and stronger than the previous pair.  She would soon come to realize that while to HER the lenses were thicker, to OTHERS, it is not really noticed.  And if it is, so what?  It might be just a minute that someone looks then they've forgotten about it, so don't you let it bother you for longer than that minute.  Immediately she would notice her near vision is considerably better, and within a day or two her distant vision would be better, as well.  Since one eye is stronger than the other, yes, there will be more  magnification but again remember, YOU are looking for that and not many other people will be.  + lenses like you girls wear are thicker in the center, and as the prescription gets stronger, the lenses are thicker,but there isn't much you can do about that.  But likewise, you girls are lucky in a sense because your eyes get magnified, and that can be very pretty on young ladies.  Eventually when your prescription stabilizes you can think about contact lenses but for now I think you will come to enjoy the great vision and the thickness won't even be a factor.  I think that there are also certain lenses that can be made to look thinner but I don't know much about them and maybe someone here does?  Don't worry about it, Kerrie.  Glasses are glasses not matter how thick or thin, and they do not define the person that is wearing them.  If someone chooses to judge you solely on the thickness of your glasses does not deserve a moment of your time!  Let us know how you come alone.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kerrie</b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2004, 11:23</p><p>Hi again. Not in a good frame of mind to post more tonight. The new glasses are horrid. They seem twice as thick as before and the lenses stick out from the frame and they seem very thick in the centre. Wanted to hang on to my old pair, but my Mum made me hand them in to have the perscription changed in them. I think everyone is looking at my eyes, the left eye looks so big. Will post again tomorrow when had time to calm down. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ree</b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2004, 09:45</p><p>  Kerrie </p><p>  I can understand what you must be going through.  It must be quite a psychological impact to go from not wearing glases to getting a Rx of +6 within a span of few months.  But dont worry,, anyway bynow you have accepted the fact you will have to wear glasses,  so it dosent matter if the Rx increases,  which is anything but natural in teenagers.   </p><p>  Though +6 lenses are going to be substantially thicker then the previous ones as there is quite a bit of jump, you will get used to them in a matter of days and the positive side is that your vision will be crystal clear again..Ok</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kerrie</b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2004, 08:19</p><p>Thanks Smudgeur and Puffin. Kind remarks make a world of difference when you are feeling upset about anything. </p><p>Hope you are correct in saying there will not be a big difference in my new lenses. Am going to get them as soon as finished on here, by Mums just come home and will be ready to take me in about ten mins. The frame is nearly identical to my old one, only slightly thicker. Don't expect people will notice they are not the same frames, and in that case, hope they will not noice the stronger lenses. Going to get my new perscription put in my old specs as soon as pick up new ones. May be a good idea to always have a spare pair. Talk to you all later</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Smudgeur</b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2004, 06:38</p><p>Hi Kerrie </p><p> </p><p>I'm sure you'll be fine there's not such a hige difference in the appearance between +3.75 and +6.00 so your friends will probably not even notice. The main thing is that you get the prescription that is correct for you - that way your vision will be clear and you won't get headaches or eye strain. Hope it works out OK for you - I'm sure you'll be fine once you've got used to the new strength. </p><p> </p><p>BTW - whereabouts in the UK are you? I'm in Essex.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2004, 04:56</p><p>Don't worry Kerrie, your friends will soon get used to you being in glasses. And as for those idiots who might make fun of you, well, they've got a worse problem than poor vision - they're stupid!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kerrie</b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2004, 03:49</p><p>Hi all from a very depressed Kerrie. </p><p>Had my eyetest this morning,and the news is not what i wanted to hear. There has been quite a change in my perscription. The optician is going to add another +2.25 to my weak eye, the left one, and +1.75 to the right eye. </p><p>And the bad news, this still will not be my final perscription. He debated to add more plus to my weak eye, but decided that i may have trouble accomodating more power at this stage. So my perscription now reads R+4.75 and L+6.00. I really am dreading seeing what they look like, I'm sure the magnification and thickness of the weak eye will look awful. My Mother cannot understand the change, she said to ask on here, does anyone else know of eyes changing as quick as mine have. It was only a few months age that i never wore glasses. I have choosen a similar frame but slightly thicker, the lady said this will hide the thickness of the lenses more, but unfortunately they will still look quite thick towards the centre. He could not estimate what my final perscription would be, all he would say, there may well be one or more changes before things are correct.  </p><p>Will be picking them up later this afternoon.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jean</b>&nbsp;18 Aug 2004, 07:46</p><p>Hi Kerrie again. I don't know if you remember, but I posted to you/your Mother when you first found out that you needed glasses. You may remember that I was only slightly older than yourself and had a very similar perscription as yourself for my first pair. Please don't worry about any increase. Opticians always seem to under perscribe on your first pair of glasses, this lets your eyes get used to them. I was told to come back in 6 months like yourself, but only lasted 4 months then had the problems that you spoke about. My next perscription jumped to R+5.75 L+6.00. Friends told me that they could not see any real change in the thickness of the lenses (Even though I could) My present RX is not my final one either, have to go back in another 6 months or earlier if problems occur. When you get your final RX, it may be worth while thinking of high index lenses, thats what my optician suggested for me when I reach the final change. You will get the blur at distance again, as you experienced with your first glasses, but it very soon goes. I believe you said that you wore them full time. If not, you will find with a stronger perscription that it gets very difficult to go without them. I cannot focus anything without mine, and leaving them off for a short period, just means ending up with a splitting headache and feeling cross eyed. Best of luck Kerrie.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kerrie</b>&nbsp;18 Aug 2004, 03:30</p><p>Thanks for all helpful replies. Have now told my mum that i am beginning to have problems again. She has booked an appointment at specsavers at 10am tomorrow morning. As she reminded me, the optician did say that it was more than likely that i would need a change or two before getting the full perscription. Just hope the change will not be large. But whatever, i know that i need them, and not wearing them is not an option. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Willy</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2004, 13:05</p><p>Kerrie -- Jackie may be correct with regard to bifocals, but don't jump to the conclusion that you will need to get them now.  The doctor may want to get you up to your full prescription before exploring that option -- and with your full prescription, you may not need an add. </p><p> </p><p>Also, you mentioned you feel your eyesight is weaker since you've started wearing glasses.  In one sense that is true, in another is is not.  Your "eyesight," literally speaking, has probably not changed that much at all in the last two months; the difference is that previously, your focusing muscles were overworking to compensate for the poor vision your eyes were delivering.  In the time you've been wearing glasses, those muscles have not had to work as hard, so as any muscles will do, they've lost their tone.  In that sense, your eyes are "weaker." </p><p> </p><p>In any event, I hope all goes well with your check-up.  Please let us know.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jackie</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2004, 11:28</p><p>Kerrie, read your letter with interest. </p><p>Have you thought, with the stinking headaches you mention, you may well need an add for close work. That was the first sign we had that our daughter needed them and she was only 15. She had the same symptoms, not quite so clear in the distance, and constant headaches. All it took to clear the problem, was a slight increase in her distance, and an add for close work.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kerrie</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2004, 11:16</p><p>Thanks all for helpful replies. It all seems to have changed in the last month. Before that, all was well, except for feeling cross eyed when i left them off for any time. I'm beginning to wish that i had not started wearing glasses. It appears to me, they have made my eyesight weaker than it was before. It is impossible to leave my glasses of for any long period. My eyes feel as if they are wandering all over the place. I know all you guys are right, will have to talk to my mum and get another appointment made. Thanks again, even if it wasn't what i wanted to hear.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2004, 11:05</p><p>Kerrie, </p><p>It may mean you need stronger glasses, or maybe you need adjustment of any correction for cylindar (astigmatism) Also, sometimes your monthly cycle can affect your eyes so give it a week, but do take care of it before school starts! (one less thing)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2004, 11:02</p><p>Hello Kerrie, </p><p> </p><p>Just tell your mother about your situation and go back to the eye doctor. You are already used to wearing your glasses and will greatly benefit from getting a new stronger prescription, one where things are crystal clear again.  You mentioned that you knew this was a possibility in six months but it happened earlier.  Good for you- clear vision again even sooner.  My daughter is around your age (though her glasses are much stronger)and has had several prescription increases.  Her newest glasses have bifocals in them and she is very happy.  She has, believe it or not, always been thrilled with getting stronger glasses because it has meant that she is able to see better.  I think you will be happy as well.  Good luck and please share with us what your results are.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Derek</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2004, 11:00</p><p>Kerrie, Sorry to say, but do not think you need a weaker perscription. Agree with Curt, you could end up with quite a stronger perscription. I know its not what you want to hear, but you will see all the clearer and not have those headaches. Please inform your mum, and go and get your eyes re-tested. The longer you leave it, the worse it will be. Its no big deal now, you are used to wearing glasses. And I doubt if anyone will notice the difference if the strength of your lenses is increased.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Willy</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2004, 10:58</p><p>Kerrie -- I agree with Curt, that a stronger prescription may be needed, and that's why you've been told to check back in six months.  As for it being only two months or so, I think this just indicates that your eyes have adapted well to the first prescription and that you are ready for more to reach what is more likely your "real" prescription. </p><p> </p><p>As for telling your mother, you should get it over with -- she knows she'll be taking you in again in a few months anyway.  Also, I gather you are in the UK or Ireland, so I don't know if the school schedule is at all comparable to here in the US, where school is generally out, but if so, you might think it better to get new glasses (or new lenses in old glasses) while school is out.  That way, your new glasses would be just one of countless changes your classmates will have had over the summer.  Good luck!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2004, 10:14</p><p>Kerrie: Probably not what you want to hear, but you likely need a stronger prescription.  You probably needed it from the beginning, but the eye doc figured that +3/+3.5 was strong enough for someone who never wore glasses before.  You may have always need +4 or +5 (maybe more), but the doc probably wanted to "break you in" to wearing glasses.  If the doc had given you the full strength prescription to start with, you probably would have had more difficulty getting used to them, especially for distance.  Just my $0.02 </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kerrie</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2004, 07:45</p><p>Hi folks. You may remember me from a few months ago. I was prescribed glasses when i experienced a lot of headaches. When i got them, things were fine after a week or so, close and distant vision was perfect. The optician told me that i may need to have a stronger persciption in six months or so. My question is, i have only had them just over two months, and the original clarity has gone. Objects in the far distance are not so clear, and after doing any close work for any length of time, i develop stinking headaches again. Is it possible they could have changed already, or could they have improved and i may need a weaker perscription. I really do not want any stronger glasses, but as soon as i tell my mum the problem, she will march me back to the opticians. Has anyone heard of eyes changing this quick. </p><p></p><hr>

Her Rx. then was -11; now she is just turned sixteen with an Rx of OD. -21.50/-2.25, OS -24.00/-3.50; corrected VA is 20/40. Her progression has been a bit erratic, though the average is under -1D per year. Obviously, her poor sight is limiting in some ways but she leads a full and happy life. I hope you are as fortunate.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Belinda.</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2004, 12:29</p><p>To Dr.S &amp; JR. </p><p> </p><p>I much appreciate the interest you have shown in our daughter's vision problem.The Dr. who examined her is a specialist in childrens' eyesight, and we are satisfied that she has received the best possible treatment. As for the prognosis it seems that eventually she might have to wear extremely strong glasses. My husband and I are both myopic; my prescription is -2.25/-3.50, my husband has -11.50,-2.50 /-10.00,-1.75. </p><p>Doing the worst-case calculations suggested by Dr.S brings up numbers around -45 or -50D, which would doubtless mean that even her corrected vision would be very poor. </p><p>We must hope for the best.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JR</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2004, 09:06</p><p>Belinda: </p><p>Your daughter is an extreme myope with -15D at 6 mos of age.  Her condition is rare, but she is not the only one.  Did the Dr determine the major cause of her high myopia?  It sounds as if it is very high congenital progressive myopia, which can be caused by several things.  As the Dr indicated, her prescription will most likely increase every year and could go very high, -30D or more.  At some point, she probably will not be able to see normally (have 20/20 acuity) with glasses and then other things have to be done. What is important now is to keep her with the best possible prescription, as her myopia increases.  She will adapt to the necessity of wearing very strong glasses with very thick lenses, because with them she will be able to see, even if it is not perfect, and without them she will be blind and not be able to see anything.  What kind of an eye Dr did you take her to?  You should get the best possible care for her, a low vision pediatric eye Dr would be best.    Things will not be easy, but love and care by you and a good Dr will go a long way to helping her to live a relatively normal life. Best wishes to you and your daughter.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dr.S.</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2004, 08:56</p><p>This message is for Belinda. The mechanisms that cause congenital high myopia (present from birth) may be quite different from those causing high myopia that develops by progressive increase as the child develops. Sometimes, congenital myopia progresses very little during growth. If increase in the amount of nearsightedness occurs, it will add to the congenital amount already present, and the most useful insight as to prognosis/ likely progression usually comes from looking at familial factors. If there is some family history (parents, grandparents, siblings) of major amounts of myopia that developed during childhood/ adolescence, then it is sensible to assume that your young daughter will be affected by this, probably more so than if she wasnt starting off with such a high prescription. For an idea of her possible adult refractive error, take the maximum glasses prescription reached by a parent or grandparent, multiply that by 2 or 3, then add it to the present prescription for an estimate of what could happen. If both parents developed a significant degree of progressive myopia while growing up, you could add the parents current prescriptions together before doing the multiplying. Congenital high myopia can also result from complications of premature birth, and experience suggests that this variety also tends to increase a lot as the child grows up. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Belinda</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2004, 06:05</p><p> Two weeks ago our 6 month old daughter was found to be severely nearsighted, to the extent of -15.00 in each eye.I took her to be fitted with her glasses last Monday. Fortunately she has realised that life looks better with them on, and we have not had any problems on that score. The eye doc. said that her condition will progress but he can't say by how much and for how long. Are there any other parents out there who have had a child with a similar problem but is now older. I'm wondering how bad she might become.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2004, 18:02</p><p>I have had 3 surgeries, and the prisms came later. I go for my Oph. Ped. every 4/ 6 months for tests as my eyes began to cross more and more severely. That is when my dad takes me to doc eyes. Even now, with my new glasses my eyes are so crossed and they got worst when I read. By the way, I have a mild nystagmus due eyes muscle problem. </p><p>My new bifocals bother me so much, I really don't know what I am going to do, but getting  two pairs of glasses, one for regular wearing to correct my far sight and the crossing and another one for reading, writing or to see general small things closer? My doc thinks this is not a good option for a boy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ant</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2004, 02:10</p><p>Hi 4 Eyes - </p><p>Well, I really don't know how you manage with an Rx like that - your lenses must be so so thick. I think mine are bad enough with my 10 prism base out, but yours - wow !! </p><p>Have you ever had surgery to try and correct the turn in your eyes ? I have had it twice, and it seemed to work for a while, and the prisms are reduced. However, in my case, the problem seemed to return within a couple of years. Now I always seem to get an increase in both my astigmatism and my prism whenever I go for an eye test. I really don't know how you are going to manage later on as you are very young still. How often do you go for a test? - I need to go every 6 months</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JR</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2004, 20:07</p><p>4 Eyes: </p><p>The bifocal adds are for seeing up close and the additional plus power in the bifocal lenses your Dr has determined you need to read and write and see small things up close.  If the bifocals bother you so much in your regular glasses, maybe you need to get two pairs of glasses, one for regular wearing to correct your high hyperopia and crossing eyes and the other for reading, writing, and seeing in general small things close to you and also correcting your crossing eyes.  This is not as convenient as the bifocals, but if they cause you so much bother and trouble and you cannot adjust to them, the two glasses option might work for you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>myopicgermangirl</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2004, 16:02</p><p>4eyes, the reason why you don't see 100% with your glasses might be that your sight did not develop properly in early childhood. That is called amblyopia. I assume you have been farsighted all your life. I don't know when you first got glasses but maybe it was a little too late or they were not completely the right prescription then? </p><p> </p><p>I also wonder if you still have the lenses in your eyes of if they were removed in cataract surgery.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pauline</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2004, 06:43</p><p>Brian-16, Curt. Thanks for your replies,and the explanation of why things appear upside down. Yes her new glasses are stronger.

<p><b>JJ</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2004, 21:32</p><p>According to the National Eye Institute "low vision is defined as the best-corrected visual acuity less than 6/12 (&lt;20/40) in the better-seeing eye"  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2004, 16:39</p><p>question-No,it does not sound like low vision if thats your corrected vision. </p><p>I would guess if you only had 20/80 or worse that would be low..   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>question</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2004, 14:30</p><p>What is the definition of low vision? Do I have it if my corrected vision is 20/25 and 20/50? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2004, 10:32</p><p>Pauline: Once a + lenses reaches a certain strength, looking thru them makes images upside down instead of just making things look bigger.

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2004, 08:23</p><p>Pauline- My guess is the rx in the new glasses are stronger.I guess they are (+) plus lenses..There is a different focal point in these new lenses.How is her vision with them as opposed to without them?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pauline.</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2004, 08:10</p><p>I really must post here and say what a wonderful site this is. The amount of information and help posted is a joy to see. A friend put me on to the site when my daughter was told she would need to wear glasses. That was a year ago. Perhaps someone can answer me a question that is bothering me. From time to time, I would clean my daughters glasses, then hold them up to the light to check for any smears. When I now do this with her new glasses she got last week, objects appear upside down through them. I checked again with her original pair, this did not happen. </p><p>Anyone got any ideas?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kerrie</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2004, 07:18</p><p>Still no probs with my glasses, except when i take them off, cannot see very clearly. Expect thats because my eyes have adjusted to them, as people said they would. Had a laugh Sunday, my Mum left her reading glasses at her Sisters, and had to borrow mine to write some e-mails and read her mail. If and when i need stronger ones, don't know what she will do then.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Steve</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2004, 01:35</p><p>Kerrie, you have done really well with your glasses. I had mine at just about your age, and know they do take some getting used to. Im now 20, and got my first pair at 15. Prescription was  R+3.25  L+3.00.  Dont be surprised if you get an increase at your next check up. That happened to me twice. Like yourself, I was told to come back in six months  for further tests. I only managed just under five months, when headaches came back and vision was not as sharp as it had been. New prescription was R+5.00 L+4.50.Quite a jump.  That lasted for just over a year and am now R+6.50 L+5.00. Have had present prescription for nearly two years and everything still very sharp. If you do need a jump in strength, have new lenses put in your old frame, thats what I did, and people do not even notice the change. My girlfriend loves me in them, and wishes she could wear glasses, but she has perfect sight. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kerrie</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2004, 23:45</p><p>Todd Julian. Thanks for nice comments. </p><p>Guess am adjusted to them now. Lot better now distant vision is clear. When i go back for my full script, expect the distance will be blurry again. No idea what my increase will be, but hope not to much. Would have been easier to have full strength specs to start with.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2004, 09:34</p><p>Kerrie, I too am very happy to hear that you adapted so well to your new eyewear. </p><p>A couple of weeks ago I over heard a conversation between two girls about 21 yo. One had just got plus lens glasses for the first time. The conversation went as follow: </p><p>1) What, did you do? Have to get glasses! </p><p>2) Yeah, just got them a week ago. </p><p>1) What do you need to wear them for? </p><p>2) Seeing. </p><p>1) How do you like them? </p><p>2) I hate them. </p><p>For a time she put her glasses on top of her head but only minutes later she returned them back on her face. Her frames were brown plastic rectangles and the lenses made her blue eyes look only slightly magnafied. I thought she looked very pretty in them. Prettier in fact than when she had them off. I myself wear a simular Rx and as I walked past her, I looked at her and gave her a big smile. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2004, 08:55</p><p>Well done, Kerrie! You have obviously adjusted well and quickly to your glasses, and if distances are blurred without them that means your eyes are now relaxed - no more headaches or eyestrain. Only thing, they may up your Rx at your next check-up if you aren't already wearing your full correction. Doesn't sound as if that'll worry you though ::) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kerrie</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2004, 01:09</p><p>Hi All.  Have now had my glasses for just over a week, 8 days to be exact. I said would post after a week; let you all know how things are going. Have not had any real problems. Am in the habit of putting them on as soon as I get up and taking them off before going to bed.  Looking in the mirror doesnt seem strange any more, at first seeing this stranger in glasses peering back was odd.  My distant vision is now perfect as is close and intermediate. My distant vision was very good before getting my glasses, but now if I take them off, distance is quite blurred, expect this is because my eyes have adjusted to my glasses. Would this sound right? .  Mums pleased  at how I have adapted to wearing them so easily, and that she doesnt have to nag me to put them on. So any young girl or man worried about the thought that they may need glasses, there is no need. If it helps you see well then its got to be worth it</p><p></p><hr>

Object 20ft away, was perfectly clear, as was close. Distant only problem. Optiican explained to me and my Mother that it was very important that I wore them full time. The muscles in my eyes were having difficulty in focus, between distant and close. If I was looking at something far away, then looked at something close, the close object blurry for a short while, until eye could focus. Same other way round. </p><p>I can say, all my headaches have stopped and no longer feel eyes tired and pulling towards end of day. Hope this helps Sarah.

<p><b>Sarah</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2004, 14:10</p><p>Kerrie - When you got your glasses, were things in the distance pretty blurry (I mean, at first), or were they pretty clear and just slightly blurry?

To answer your questions in order. </p><p>Still feel a bit strange when I look in the mirrow, and see this person in glasses looking back. It still seems a bit odd putting on my glasses in the morning when I get up, but I'm sure I will get used to that. My parents are more than pleased with me, to quote my Mother, you have reacted beyond all our expections. This because apart from my intitial attitude, I now admit that my eyesight was not good, and glasses do help greatly. As for wearing them full time, I have done since I got them. To be quite honest, don't think I will have any choice in the matter. Apart from my parents would not let me leave them off, I'm really beginning to feel comfortable with them on. Contacts is something to think about in the future. The optician would not entertain this avenue  whilst my eyes are still liable to change. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katie</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2004, 10:40</p><p>Kerrie, it is so wonderful that you are enjoying your glasses.  How do you feel when you look at yourself in the mirror now?  Are you used to seeing yourself in glasses or does it still seem odd?  What types of comments did you get from your school mates?  How are your parents reacting to you now?  And do you think you will continue with your full time wear, and with glasses, or do you think you want contacts some day?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kerrie</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2004, 08:23</p><p>Puffin. After wearing my glasses for nearly 5 days, my distanct vision is improving. Close and intermediate are still amazing. I've not had one headache since wearing them. My eys feel far more relaxed. The optician did say until my eyes got used to the glasses, changing from close to distant views may take some adjusting. If I stare at a distant object, it does not appear to be so blurry, but if looking at something close, and suddenly look into the distance, it is blurred for a few seconds, then clears to only a slight blur. Am not very good at explaining this Puffin, sorry.Enjoying being a GWG more than I ever thought. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2004, 16:10</p><p>Kerrie (and others) have mentioned this odd-sounding blurring effect of new plus-lens correction: I wonder could anyone - perhaps Kerrie herself - quantify it, perhaps in terms of visual acuity?

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2004, 06:11</p><p>Kerrie: the first of 'Jules's rules' which I worked out a while ago is : "Everybody thinks your glasses are strong unless their own are stronger."

<p><b>Kerrie</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2004, 01:42</p><p>Sunday. Earned brownie points from Mum, put my glasses on when I came down for breakfast. Distant still blurry, may be a bit clearer, but not really sure. Hung around the house Sunday morning doing some homework. No strain whatsoever whilst using them for close work, which is a great relief. Went out to Mums friends for lunch. Wanted to leave glasses off, but Mum would not let me. They have a son I quite fancy, so was a bit shy about wearing them. Needn't have worried, first thing he said is "Cool" lets try them. Usual story, he couln't see much through them. My Mums friend wasn't quite so helpful. Her words, What a shame a young girl has to start wearing glasses, will she really need to wear them. Mum explained that I will need them full time, and should have had them some time ago. Last big test, is going to school tomorrow. Not feeling quite as bad about it, as when first told that I had to wear specs. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-Observer</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2004, 01:36</p><p>Does anyone else notice that Worried Mum originally posted the spelling of her daughter's name: Kerry and now it's Kerrie with a mysterious Kerrie posting?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kerrie</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2004, 01:09</p><p>Will post this a a day to day feeling of how I felt when first got my glasses.  </p><p>Saturday. </p><p>Very epprehensive when we arrived at the opticians, the lady told me to take a seat with my Mum and she would get my glasses. When she took them out of the case, I was taken aback at how thick they seemed and how they magnified. She then placed them on my face. Distant was very blurred, but intermediate and close were perfect. If I doubted deep down that I needed glasses, there was none now. Told the distance vision will improve. Was asked if wanted to wear them now or take home and try. My Mother replied before I could "She will wear them"  We left the shop, myself walking very slowly. I kept wanting to push them down and look over the top. After a few hours shopping with Mum, I began to forget they were on, apart from distance vision. One good thing that happened, (Did not think good at the time) met up with a couple of my schoolfriends, usual thing, when did you get glasses, lets try them, arn't they strong ect. But thats two less in my class that I will have to face Monday at school. Rest of the day was fairly quiet, stayed in and watched tv. </p><p>My specs are better than my mums, no headaches or strain. To sum up the day, it hasn't been bad. Still don't like the way my eyes are bigger. But am going on the thought that if i'm good and wear them now, might not need increase in six months, or not so big. </p><p>Will post later about Sunday </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Worried Mum</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2004, 00:18</p><p>Katie, forgot to ask, how old was your daughter when first needed glasses.And what is her script now. Can Kerrie expect big changes. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Worried Mum</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2004, 23:35</p><p>Katie. You are so kind in your remarks. </p><p>Guess we will soon get used to Kerrie wearing her glasses. Apart from getting used to the magnification they look fine. She is aware that her perscription may well get stronger, within 6 months. By that time any of her worries about wearing them should have gone away. What upset me more, was her perscription is as strong as my reading glasses, stronger in one eye. Can't see more than a couple of feet in them. She will be posting herself shortly, she is making out a day to day report starting from saturday when she got her glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katie</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2004, 16:11</p><p>Worried mum, </p><p>So happy to hear that Kerry got her glasses.  I completely understand her initial reluctance but once she has worn them for a little while she will come to appreciate, and expect, that clearer vision.  What happens is that once she becomes used to having her glasses on, when they are off her vision will seem much worse than it was before she started wearing glasses.  It actually is not any worse, it is just what her vision really was like before but she was able to focus (and get headaches,and have eyestrain) so it seemed clearer. When her eye muscles relax and let the glasses work for her she will be so happy.   </p><p> </p><p>It won't be unusual for the prescription to increase at her first 6 month visit.  All that means is that she has to get new thicker lenses; it becomes an exciting time actually because while prescription increases sound like a bad thing, they provide much clearer and more crisp vision and that is great.  Since she's hyperopic, her eyes will continue to get more magnified but as I've seen with my daughter, it seems like something we are looking for and the average person might not even notice.  My daughter's first prescription  of around +4 and +5 magnified her eyes, and it was noticable because I was used to her eyes not wearing glasses.  With the increase, while it magnified them more it really did not seem obvious because she was already in glasses by then.   </p><p> </p><p>I know we get concerned about full time wear but it really is in their best interest.  Soon enough you, and Kerry, will think she looks different WITHOUT her glasses on.  Please keep us updated on how things are going; I'm really interested.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Worried Mum</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2004, 00:06</p><p>So greatful for all you guys and girls who have helped over young Kerry needing glasses. When I took her to pick them up on Sat, Was a bit shocked to see how they magnified her eyes. Apart from that, she looks very nice in them. My Husband and myself have told her that she does not have a choice about when to wear them. Its full time with no exceptions. Her far distance is a bit blurry, but the optician said this wil improve as her eyes get used to them. We have told Kerry now she has had them for a few days, she can post herself on this scene. So thats what she is going do. Give you her version of how she felt the first time she wore them and any problems she encounted. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jean</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2004, 23:41</p><p>Dave C. Got lots of headaches at school. Then my friend was perscribed glasses for longsight. Could not believe how clear things were with them. </p><p>My last script just over 2 months ago was R+5.75 L+6.00. There is now way I could go without them, am as blind as a bat. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave C</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2004, 13:51</p><p>High Jean. What Made you first realise that you need glasses, and how long did it take you to become a full time wearer.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jean</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2004, 11:56</p><p>Kerry, don't worry about wearing your glasses. Im 16 had similar script at your age and now am just double that. After a few weeks , you will wonder how you manageded without them . Enjoy being a high + wearer</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mom to High Plus</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2004, 18:58</p><p>Worried Mum, </p><p> </p><p>It was difficult for the first few days with my daughter when she first got glasses at 20 mos.  She was distracted by them and did try to pull them off a lot.  Meanwhile, we were anxious to have her wear them a lot as she was at risk for lazy eye and poor binocular vision development if she did not wear them.  Also, with all her handling of them, we were constantly afraid she would damage them (and that did happen quite a few times through her handling them or some other little kid getting their hands on them).  It was a long three days or so. </p><p> </p><p>What worked for us was getting her out of the house...if she was distracted by being in a new fun place, she forgot about her glasses.  Once she left them on for a few hours at a time, I guess she realized they weren't so bad and it was smooth sailing with her from there.  It took about 3 days or so, to get to that point. </p><p> </p><p>We did have problems (a few) with little friends of hers sometimes being too curious about the glasses.  And when her little brother came along (6 mos after she got glasses) and got big enough to grab, well, let's just say we had to run to get her glasses fixed a lot.  He is now 2 1/2 and still grabs them a lot. </p><p> </p><p>I agree with a lot of what Katie wrote, esp. the part about children picking up on the parent's attitudes re. glasses and also about how you get so used to seeing your child in the glasses.  I can't imagine my daughter without them either and she really likes them and has fun with them...she is not self conscious about them at all and enjoys having different pairs and picking out new ones, etc. </p><p> </p><p>I hope Kerry does well with them...I bet she will adjust better than you think!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katie</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2004, 16:00</p><p>to Worried Mum, </p><p> </p><p>I know how you feel about being told one of your children needs corrective lenses; I've been there two times.  Most important is that no matter how you feel about it, do NOT let Kerry think that you are anything other than excited and encouraging.  Kids have an inept ability to read into what we're feeling no matter what me might say!  She was prescribed full time wear for a reason, that she needs them, so please be sure you encourage her to wear them continuously.  With her + prescription it will take a few days until her eyes relax enough to let the glasses do the work; up until now, her eyes have been working overtime to focus in and out.  And once she is used to wearing them she will see how unclear her world really is when she takes them off! </p><p> </p><p>I have one severely myopic/astigmatic daughter that was given a rather significant prescription at 14 months, and a high hyperope that got into glasses at four, so I certainly understand your feeling.  I was initially upset that my little cuties needed glasses, full time at that. But the minute the younger one got her glasses they never came off, she was that much in need (the full correction was given at the beginning).  My older daughter took a few days of me putting them back on her and once her eyes adjusted she, too, doesn't want to be without them.  She has had one increase in strength and is due for another appointment in June for what is supposed to be another increase; the doctor did not want to give her the full correction she needed initially because she may not have been able to handle it.  It is currently +6.5 and +8.0.   </p><p> </p><p>You will find that when Kerry has her glasses on (which should be all the time!) that her eyes may be magnified somewhat, and at that prescription it will be just beautiful. It was hard to imagine my girls in glasses before they had them.  Now they look strange when they don't wear them.  I know they are much younger than Kerry, but when I see how much their lives are changed by merely wearing glasses everyday, I just can't believe it.  Sure Kerry will be concerned what others think, but these days glasses are fashionable, and once she sees the clarity of her vision, she shouldn't want to remove them.  it is likely they will get stronger, but so too will Kerry, and her will to wear something that will help her each and every day.  I got glasses when I was 16, was told to wear them every day, and was So worried about what others would think.  I'm glad I wore them, because they helped me immensely and who knows where those people are that I was so worried about.    Have Kerry wear them over the weekend to get used to the feeling.  And please let us know how it goes.  She will come to love her glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Babs</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2004, 22:48</p><p>Hallo Worried Mum </p><p>Your daughter will very soon get used to her glasses and wear them with no problems. I had a similar problem as her. Like me, I think you will find that she has had a problem for a number of years, and has not done anything about it, because she does not want to wear glasses. Thats just what happened to me and my first perscription was R+3.25 L+3.25 </p><p>That was 4 years ago and now have script of R+5.00 L+4.75.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Worried Mum</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2004, 22:11</p><p>Mum of High plus </p><p>Its great to have all this support. Sure will let you know how things go. </p><p>We thought this was a strong perscription for her first pair, but reading these threads, that is not so.In fact would appear quite mild to some. How did you manage to get your daughter to wear the glasses, let alone keep them on, at such a young age.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mom to High Plus</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2004, 15:42</p><p>Hi Worried Mum, </p><p> </p><p>I can imagine that that was jarring for you and also for your daughter...I bet 15 is a tough age to start wearing.  I remember how surprised I was when my little girl needed glasses and such strong ones (she had the eye crossing in problem but I thought it would be corrected thru eye muscle surgery--not that I liked the idea of that either).  My daughter also didn't seem to have problems "seeing" other than the eye crossing, so it was quite a surprise to have her need strong glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Hopefully your daughter will make a good adjustment.  I bet when she realizes how much easier it is to wear the glasses (to see better and more comfortably), she will feel more comfortable wearing them more often and outside the house. </p><p> </p><p>Also, hopefully, your daughter has friends that will be supportive about the glasses (boy--at that age, peer support is really a big help!).  Let us know how it goes!!!  Good luck.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Worried Mum</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2004, 12:45</p><p>To all the helpful friends who answered my enquiries.Kerry went for her eye exam today. The result was not what she hoped for, nor indeed ourselves. It would appear she is quite long sighted, more so in her left eye. He expressed surprise that she had not had more problems than she had told us about. She was really upset, so was I, that she will need glasses, and she will need to wear them full time. We still cannot understand how this has come about. From not needing glasses to a perscription R3.00 Left 3.75.He said her accommodation must have been hard pushed to accept the change from close to distant vision. If he is correct, she has hid this problem a long time from us. And we had never had a clue about how poor her eyes must have been.  </p><p>She has picked a small silver oval frame, which looks quite attractive on her. The glasses will be ready to collect tomorrow morning. The next proplem will be getting her to wear them. After the exam, she is determined that whatever we say, she will only wear them when her eyes were sore, and never outside the house. Guess we will have to sit down and talk to her again, the optician did state to her, it was very important that she wore them full time. He explained her distant vision would be slightly blurry, but after a week or so, her eyes would learn to accept the perscription. He requires to see her in six months to see how her eyes have adjusted to the perscription. </p><p>My husband and myself did not tell her, but he did say,that the perscription may need to be increased as her eyes adjusted to these lenses. Will post and let you know how she gets on. At the moment, think we are going to have a battle on our hands. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mom to High Plus</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2004, 17:13</p><p>If you're serious, I'm guessing you don't have children :).  Children are quite inclined to bring things close to their face with absolutely no effort on the parent's part.  I would say the first place we noticed the crossing was when my daughter was focusing on her eating her food!  I think everyone does that kind of close work. </p><p> </p><p>But my daughter being a high hyperope (if I have the right word) needs her eyeglasses for both distance and close focusing, she wears them all the time, even while sleeping.  And yes, she does do "close" work in preschool and she needs them then too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2004, 17:07</p><p>You had your 20month old kid doing close work? That's a bit extreme.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mom to High Plus</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2004, 17:02</p><p>My daughter was just 20 mos old when she began to wear eyeglasses for farsightedness, her RX was +8.00 in left and +7.75 in right.  We noticed it because her left eye began to cross in for close work, that is why we took her in to the pediatric eye doc.  She has accomodative esotropia but she is fortunate because the glasses (single vision) entirely correct her crossing.  It took a few days but she became very compliant very quickly. </p><p> </p><p>She is now 4 1/2 and had a check up today, she is now +7.50 left and +7.00 right with +.50 in astig. in both eyes.  But the glasses still entirely correct the crossing so now eye muscle surgery yet.  She is being watched for lazy eye (has been for over a year) but her left eye (poorer vision than the right) is improving so no patching for now.  We continue to hope it improves. </p><p> </p><p>I'm sure she is an extreme example, but it goes to show that some of the young ones really do need the plus correction.  I am so thankful she has such a good attitude about the glasses and she gets a lot of positive compliments...they really do look cute on her.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2004, 16:46</p><p>Anne, its good to have a positive attitude about tour daughters vision and needing glasses. I was long sighted too and needed glasses from at least fourth grade but my mother didn't believe any of her childred should need glasses. And sense school vision tests only screen for myopia and not hyperopia , I guess that was good enough for her. My close up vision was getting to the point that I had to strain just to read a newspaper.  I had to drop out of high school in the eleventh grade and go to work for a while to earn mony to buy myself eyeglasse. So please don't let this happen to your kid. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest 1 </b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2004, 16:45</p><p>Anne- Worried Mum, maybe a good way to introduce your daughter to glasses is to have photos of her favorite pop artist, or film star and just have the around the house for your daughter to see, thats provided she likes pop stars. </p><p> </p><p>There are television presenter who wear glasses maybe you could have the television on when this particualr presenter is on.Kids don,t like to think they are the odd one out in their peer group, but if you can show her its cool to wear glasses as seen by her favorite personalities this may ease her into accepting her need to wear glasses. I appreciate it can be a real problem encouraging children to wear glasses and sometimes it can be so fustrating for mum, but with patience and seeing your daughter problem through her eyes it maybe easier  for her to come to terms with her need for glasses. Good Luck we are all with you in the post room.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anne.</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2004, 15:23</p><p>Julian. Certainly, I will let you know how my daughter gets on at her next eye exam. My optician did say at the time, it was a strong perscription for a first time wearer, but both her eye muscles appeared to be very weak for some reason. And it was this that was giving problems with the near and distant vision. I have been long sighted since just before leaving school and am now nearly 30, but her perscription is stronger than mine. I only really wore mine full time when my daughter was told she had to wear them, I thought this might help her. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2004, 13:41</p><p>Anne, and Worried Mum: Young hyperopes are able to see clearly (especially if they have no astigmatism) by constantly using their eye muscles to focus on distant as well as near objects. This causes eyestrain - but it also becomes a habit it is difficult to break, and it takes time for they eyes to learn to relax. This is why your daughter, Anne, had problems seeing distant objects with her first glasses, and that was less than her full correction. Optometrists often have to undercorrect the first time (and sometimes again) till the patient learns to tolerate the correction. I'd have thought 6 was young to have this problem, as young children's eyes are pretty adaptable, but there you are. Do let us know what happens when she has her next check. </p><p>Worried Mum, if your daughter is already able to see distances with your glasses, it sounds as if she has done some of the priliminary work already. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anne</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2004, 09:06</p><p>Worried Mum.  Don't get to upset about your daughter needing glasses. This happened to mine when she was 6. When she notices how clear things are and no headaches, getting her to wear them will not be a problem. The only thing we had difficulty with, she said they made things blurry at distance. And the optician said he was not giving her the full perscription until she had these for six months. Why, I am not sure.  </p><p>Her six months is coming up. Any of you experts know if she will have this problem with distance vision again until her eyes get used to them. Her first perscription was fairly strong (to me) reads R+3.00 L+3.75. She now has no problems with them, so hope her next change is not a big increase.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2004, 07:46</p><p>Worried Mum, if your daughter does in deed have hyperopia please do not despair. Needing glasses is not the worse thing in the world. It just seem to be at first. Billions of people of all ages wear glasses everyday. The important thing to remember is that your daughter is able to see correctly. There are so many types of eyeglass frames today to choose from and she will find the perfect pair to bring out  all her beauty. There is also the contact lens option which she can consider at some point too. I know that after getting used to wearing them she will not only enjoy the clear vision they provide and the freedom form eyestrain and headaches but she will come to like her glasses and wearing them will become as natural a thing as putting on shoes and socks. Don't worry about the teasing. People who tease others are just jealous for attention. Only a jerk makes fun of someone with eyewear. And be thankful to your babysitter, she did your daughter a big favor. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Worried Mum</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2004, 06:32</p><p>Thanks for reply Val. We really hope she does not have to wear them full time. I asked her this morning could she see the tv with my new glasses. Dismayed to found out she could. They are +3.00 and +3.50. How can a young girl that has never had problems be able to see clearly at that distane through my glasses. To me the tv is a complete blur, yet she can see it clearly about 12ft away. Anyway we have an appointment at specsavers tomorrow afternoon when she finishes school. She is still very upset about this and wishes the babysitter had kept quiet.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Val</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2004, 01:49</p><p>Worried mom, it is possible that your daughter has the pupilar distance when looking at long distance the same as yours at close distance. So, glasses like your reading glasses, with the correct prescription, will be perfect for your daughter. If she is indeed a hyperope, at her age, she will have to wear the glasses full-time at least 1 month, because the eyes are using now a lot of extra accomodation that causes the eye strain.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JT</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2004, 15:26</p><p>Thinking about the sore eyes thing, it may be that she has some astigmatism? i don't know, I'm not an eyecare professional but I do know that uncorrected astigmatism can make eyes sore after a while. The optician will be able to advise you on this.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JT</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2004, 15:24</p><p>Worried mum </p><p>Do any of her friends have glasses? At that age, I can remember there were several people in my year at school who had them. There is also the possibility of her getting contacts, she would probably be responsible enough to take care of them if she really doesn't want to wear glasses. I know if my prescription got a bit stronger and I had to go for fulltime wear, I would probably get contacts for the convenience even though I like my glasses.  </p><p>Try and reassure her its not the end if the world if she does need glasses. make sure you spend time choosing a frame she really likes, and that should help enormously.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Worried Mum</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2004, 14:53</p><p>JT and Julian. My Husband sat down with our daughter tonight and had a long chat. After some time, she admitted that for the last year or so, she has been bothered with headaches, and her eyes often feel sore at the end of the day. My reading glasses did help her when watching tv. We asked why she never told us, she doesn't know why. We can both see how distraught she is about the fact she may need glasses. I only hope its for close work, but we have told her, if she needs them, it is for her own good. Have also instructed her younger Brother not to tease her about it if she does have glasses, Its the last thing she needs now. I have never seen her so upset.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Worried Mum</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2004, 09:28</p><p>Thanks again JT. Both my husband and myself suspect from her reaction when it was suggested she have her eyes tested , she may have been having problems for some time. When she calms down a bit, we will sit down and try to have a chat with her. Ive seen lots of posts on this site that should help her. And it would seem from some of the posts, Girls who wear glasses, do get passes.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JT</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2004, 08:21</p><p>The heavy workload at school or college leading up to exams can actuallt bring out eye problems. Around the time I did my GCSEs, several people in my class at school started wearing glasses- one of my close friends was prescribed about +2 even though she'd had no eye problems before, and another friend got about -1 for short-sight around the same time. </p><p>Best of luck with the eye exam. At least if she does need glasses, there are some trendy frames about- mine at the moment are really trendy in plastic and look great on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Worried Mum</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2004, 08:17</p><p>Thanks JT and Julian. You may be right in what you say. But I checked, and my old glasses she was using are quite strong, think thay are about +2.50. I can't see anything at distance in them.She went daft when I suggested we arrange eye test for her. Her eyesight she said is perfect. She can kick up a row as much as she likes, but its a visit to specsavers for her when I can arrange an appointment. She does admit to headaches from time to time, but this is due to heavy workload at school approaching exams, (her opinion) </p><p>Am searching through the threads to see if anything published that I can get her to read. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JT</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2004, 08:04</p><p>Worried mum, I agree with Julian. I found out I was long-sighted by putting on my mum's reading glasses and being able to see distance in them. When you're young, you can accommodate for being long-sighted, but sometimes you get eye strain. I was 22 when I got glasses, and even now 6 years later, I don't have to wear them all the time, only for close work or when my eyes get tired. Your daughter may have a minimal prescription and not even need glasses very often, but useful to have them in case of eyestrain or very small print.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2004, 07:46</p><p>Worried Mum: school eye examinations pick upo short sight (myopia) but not much else. If your daughter can see the TV screen with your reading glasses on I'd have thought she has got to be hyperopic. Take her to an optometrist - if she isn't suffering eye strain yet she soon will be. And if I'm wrong there's no harm done. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Worried Mum</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2004, 07:41</p><p>I had been to the optician to pick up my new reading glasses. On the way home, met the young girl who babysits for us once or twice a week. I was commenting on how your eyes change as you get older. She then informed me that my daughter, aged nearly 15 quite often uses a pair of my old glasses to watch tv in bed. I Cannot understand how she can even see the tv in them, they are for close work. I confronted my daughter on this, and she admits she only done it for fun. Her eyesight seem quite ok, I have pointed out signs in the distant, and she reads them fine.  </p><p>Surely, if she had a problem, it would have been picked up at school during routine eye examinations. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2004, 12:54</p><p>Sorry, I should check your prescription before I make up numbers. Please forgive me. The answer is still true, but the numbers are stronger than you have. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2004, 12:51</p><p>I think that is an easy question to answer! </p><p> </p><p>The top and bottom lenses are called bifocals, the top lens will have your distance correction (which is +24,50 and +24,75) This is for viewing things in the distance. </p><p> </p><p>The lower part of the lenses are for reading, so they will be made with the +24 +the reading add (which in your case is +4,75 if i remember correctly) </p><p> </p><p>This will give you a strength of +29,25 and +29,50. I remember the first time I was given bifocals. My first trip on the Underground in London when I was 12 going to school was a nightmare because I could not focus on my feet or the steps on the escalator or the platform edge. Now 20 years later I think that I have finally got used to them. </p><p> </p><p>And that answer doesn't begin to describe how "interesting" your lenses are due to the additional cylinder and prism corrections. </p><p> </p><p>And with regards to my job, I'm not a doctor, I'm a school teacher so I spend my life explaining difficult concepts in everyday terms. But I do not usually teach students who are as attentive to my answers as you where. </p><p> </p><p>I hope that I have helped, but others may jump in and give their 2 pennies worth. </p><p> </p><p>Jack</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aliena</b>&nbsp;25 May 2004, 14:00</p><p>Jack: </p><p> </p><p>That was a great explanation.  A couple of things that I might add is that the sphere is actually half of a sphere, where in the case of a plus  sphere, the front side of the lens would be very highly curved or convex for a Rx of +24 and the back side would be only slightly curved in or concave.  </p><p> </p><p>A minus sphere is also ground from a half of a sphere, but its front surface would be slightly curved out or convex for low minus lenses, or plano [flat] or somewhat curved in or concave in high minus lenses, but the back side of the minus sphere would be highly concave or curved in for the minus Rx's and very highly concave for the very high minus Rx's. </p><p> </p><p>The base-out angle or degree of the prism indicates how much the image is shifted inward to place it more closely in front of the pupil of the strabismic or turned-in eye so as to give one image instead of two.  </p><p> </p><p>Likewise, if the eyes or eye were turning out, the prism would be base in and the image would be shifted outward to be placed in front of the pupil of the turned out eye. </p><p> </p><p>After rereading what I have just written here, I hope that I have clarified the issue further and not made the issue less clear.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JohnS</b>&nbsp;25 May 2004, 13:11</p><p>Jack, </p><p>I think that was a great explanation. </p><p> </p><p>Vic, was also asking about an explanation of the cylinder (astig)correction, I glad you explained it. You did a better job than I would have. </p><p> </p><p>John </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jack</b>&nbsp;25 May 2004, 12:49</p><p>4eyes, I will try. </p><p> </p><p>First Number is the Sphere. </p><p>You have +24,50 and +24.75. </p><p>This shows how much magnification you need in your eyes. My prescription is -16,00 and -18.25 which shows that my lenses make things smaller (the - symbol) </p><p> </p><p>The second set of numbers is the Cylinder, you have -1,75 and -2,00. This shows that your eyes need slightly less magnification at a certain angle... </p><p> </p><p>The third set of numbers shows theses angles, in your case it is 180deg and 20deg. So at these angles your lenses will be -1,75 and -2,00 less than your spherical prescription ( i.e. +22.75 and +22.75). If you add 90deg to both angles (so 20 + 90 = 110 deg and 180 + 90 = 270 deg (the same as 90)) this shows you the angle where the lenses has its full magnification. </p><p> </p><p>The Prisms show 14deg. Most people who do not require prism lenses would have their lenses made from a rectanglular piece of glass, You and I who both need Prisms have lenses made out of a triangle shaped blank, The triangle has an acute angle of 14deg for you and 6deg for me. This is the part of the lens that helps with the strabismus. </p><p> </p><p>The Base out description simply shows where the widest part of the lenses are, you and I both have Base Out so the lenses are thicker near the Arms of the glasses. Base in prisms have the thicker part near the nose. </p><p> </p><p>I hope that helps!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sarah</b>&nbsp;13 May 2004, 13:51</p><p>Someone said if you divide the 2nd number by 100, you get a rough guess at the prescription (if they're for a nearsighted person). </p><p> </p><p>Is this right: 20/200 means 200/100 which is 2.  -2 for 20/200.  I don't know; that might be sort of close.  -5 would be 20/500, -10 would be 20/1000.  These big numbers might not mean anything, because I think the eyechart only goes to 20/200 or 20/400 or so.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Seimei</b>&nbsp;13 May 2004, 09:07</p><p>Thank you for the quick answer, Joe.  You cleared up a longstanding point of curiousity for me.  What you said makes excellent sense. :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Joseph A.</b>&nbsp;12 May 2004, 11:57</p><p>Seimei: </p><p>The 20/XX system uses the first number to determine how far you stand from the eye chart, in feet. The second number refers to how well you can see at that distance. In other words, if one has 20/50 visual acuity, one can see at 20 feet, what a person with 20/20 vision can see at 50 feet.  </p><p>  The 20/XX figure usually cannot be used to determine one's prescription, yet there have been claims that one can divide the second number by 10 to arrive at the approximate minus prescription. I've not heard anything about working with plus prescriptions, or astigmatism amounts, using the 20/XX figure.  </p><p>  It seems that if one had a weak minus prescription, say minus 2, but a lot of astigmatism, say minus 5, they would have worse visual acuity than a person with a minus 7 prescription with no astigmatism. </p><p>  Therefore I would have to say 'no,' one can't tell their prescription from the 20/XX figure. Sorry. </p><p> </p><p>---Joe</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Seimei</b>&nbsp;12 May 2004, 08:00</p><p>I just stumbled upon this forum while looking for information on glasses prescriptions.  It's wonderful to find a place for information and discussion about eyes and sight with other people who have problems. </p><p> </p><p>I'm 27 with a prescription of -10.75/-11.25.  My first glasses were in 1st grade, when I was 6, and my eyes were already at -2.50.  The new, more comfortable contacts they make these days are a huge blessing. </p><p> </p><p>The search that brought me here, though, was on how to translate prescriptions.  I understand the prescription the eye doctor writes, but how does it relate to the old 20/20 numbering system everyone throws around?  How do you know what 20/X you match up to based on your prescription? </p><p> </p><p>*curious*</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BB</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2004, 03:22</p><p>Hi Hypergirl, </p><p>If you were a bus driver you would fail your driving test even with corrected vision with glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Driving privately your own car you would be fine, many drivers with a higher Rx than you drive cars saftely and with due consideration to other road users. </p><p> </p><p>I once had a friend who wore+ 10 glasses </p><p>unfortunately she could not wear contacts, she was so shy about her glasses it had major effect on her social life.

<p><b>Hypergirl</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2004, 06:27</p><p>Pete, I think that legal blindness is 20/200 corrected. I am 20/100 corrected in my Left eye and 20/25 in my right eye. I wear contacts of +12 for my Left eye and +.50 astig. and my right eye is +8 and no astig. I have worn glasses scince I have been 2 yrs. old. I have amblyopia. My glasses which I do not wear hardly at all only for emergencies are to say the least extremely thick. I have the high index and my Left lense also has a bifocal of +1.25.</p><p></p><hr>
