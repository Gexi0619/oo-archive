<p><b></b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2016, 12:10</p><p>I'm looking for a company online who sell a wide variety of contact lenses, and don't require any prescription or Doctor's information.  I use CooperVision/Preference and am having trouble finding that brand with a company who don't require Doctor authorization.  Thanks in advance!   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mevis</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2016, 22:46</p><p>Just ordered a pair of progressives glasses from <a href="http://www.optical4less.com/" target="_blank">http://www.optical4less.com</a> the lenses are perfectly spot on. Will definitely go back next time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Query</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2016, 12:58</p><p>Did you get caught for custom duty and a Post office handling charge as it was imported from USA. That has always been my experience and you have to go to the Post Office to pick them up and pay the charges which are hefty.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John London</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2016, 12:03</p><p>Sorry, i meant that I ordered them from www.firmoo.com</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John London</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2016, 12:00</p><p>Ordered two pairs of glasses on 26th August; arrived in London on 9th December. Exactly two weeks. Incredible considering that my prescription is -16 and -18 with -3.5 cyls. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;29 Aug 2016, 22:08</p><p> Firmoo is an online optical.  </p><p> If you sign into their website,they will on occasion send you a free eyeglasses offer.The last pair I got were FREE, $ 33.00 frames with single vision minus 18 lenses,and the cost was $ 11.90 for shipping,and handling to the U.S.Arrived in less than two weeks. </p><p> I have taken advantage of this twice now,and can tell you that the quality of the frames,and lenses is outstanding as is the shipping time. </p><p> They offer up to minus 18 lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 09:16</p><p>Sam </p><p>What your asking won't work. A good example of this is people that want to wear contacts and they have a small astigmatism and their CYL is -.50. The doctor will often times add an extra -.25 to the SPH and ignore the CYL completely. The idea is to try and compensate for the lack of CYL by increasing the SPH. But even with just such a small difference the person doesn't see quite as well as they do with their glasses which has the real full prescription in them. So if it doesn't work very well for even a small change from CYL to SPH it certainly won't work for what you want. </p><p>Your much better off paying the extra $9.00 so your able to see properly. Remember even with the added $9.00 your glasses are still much cheaper than buying them at your local optical store. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sam</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 08:52</p><p>Just want to bring this thread up, so hopefully someone can help me out with my wuestion in the previous post.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sam</b>&nbsp;16 Jul 2016, 10:31</p><p>I was trying to order glasses fron Zenni, becauze theh are so cheap, but sadly my prescription is "high," so they are charging me 9 extra dollars. My question is kind of weird, but I know that spehere and cylinder numbers are addative, so I was wondering if there is any way to minipulate my prescription to be heavier on cylinder and bring down the sephere to a low number? Also, would doing something like this harm my vision?  </p><p>I know it is just 9 dollars, but I feel like it is a bit unfair to ask someone to pay extra because their vision is worse.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2016, 20:32</p><p>Lance </p><p>  I believe that Zenni used lense blanks that are used in safety glasses. </p><p>  Here is  some info that I copied from a web site talking about required marking for safety equipment.Lenses that comply with the impact testing of safety glasses ,must be marked with a cross ,and a manufacturers mark,which is most likely the Z. </p><p> </p><p>Page 2  </p><p>SECTION 5  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS  </p><p>New! </p><p> Ignition </p><p> testing on all externally expo </p><p>sed materials is now required but ignition tests of textiles or  </p><p>elastic bands are  </p><p>not </p><p> required.  </p><p>New! </p><p> Formerly, </p><p> there was no specification for the soft tissue  </p><p>area around the eye that was to be protected  </p><p>by safety glasses.

Therefore, the new standard now has a </p><p> minimum coverage </p><p> area defined by a  </p><p>space of 40mm in width by 33mm in height in an ellip </p><p>tical shape centered over each eye and centered on  </p><p>the geometrical center of the lens </p><p>.  For smaller heads, this dimension changes to 34mm by 28mm and  </p><p>testing for the smaller size must be performed on th </p><p>e 54mm PD headform.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2016, 10:09</p><p>Lance </p><p>Like you I have placed orders for several hundred pairs of glasses over the past 11 years. I have only had a couple minor problems in all that time and Zenni was great about taking care of very quickly as well. Things like opening a package and having the temple unattached Oddly the screw was even in the package and nothing as broke so I just replaced the screw myself. Now i assume the glasses your wife found the registration marks on were her newer ones. Of course her feeling like they constantly needed cleaning was her seeing those marks. Like you say someone goofed and either they didn't remove the marks or they were as you say a test pair of lenses. I'm sure once they see them your wife will have a new pair of glasses coming her way. you or your wife don't seem to terribly upset about this so i assume you will still be ordering glasses from Zenni in the future? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lance</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2016, 09:37</p><p>About a month ago my wife ordered a new pair of progressives from Zenni (this is her 3rd pair from them). She has been working a lot on the computer and had noticed that the mid range on the lens was giving her problems so she switched back to her old pair (same prescription just +.25 less in the add). She also was constantly trying to clean them. </p><p> </p><p>On Saturday we were out at a basketball game and she went to clean her glasses. She held them up to the light and noticed a set of 2 registration marks on each lens. It was a cross with a Z underneath it. The marks were etched on the lens. I recognized them as registration marks from my years as a graphic designer. </p><p> </p><p>She contacted Zenni and they are having her send them back so they can inspect them. Between the 2 of us we have had at least a dozen or more glasses from Zenni and have never seen this marks on the lenses before. And to be honest this is the first problems we've had with their products. </p><p> </p><p>My guess is that this was a test and they just left the wrong lenses in.  </p><p> </p><p>Anyone ever come across something like this?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2016, 00:09</p><p> Interesting new concept for those in New York,and according to them,soon to expand elsewhere. </p><p><a href="http://www.goblink.co/" target="_blank">http://www.goblink.co/</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>PlusWearer</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2016, 07:29</p><p> </p><p>I just realized that Zenni does not offer progressives with prism correction. Does anyone have suggestions for online shops that offer this combination at similar price levels? </p><p> </p><p>Thanks! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2016, 11:06</p><p>Weirdeyes,  </p><p>No.  You can convert between + cylinder and - cylinder (or vice versa) using a simple procedure.  Lens makers covert + cylinder to - cylinder and make the glasses.  The results are optically identical. </p><p>We could tell you that messing with cylinder correction is not a good idea, unless you have lots of headache medicine handy.  There are some ways that you can compensate for refractive errors, but cylinder is not one of them. </p><p>That said, I know that you must experience the effects of incorrect Cylinder and Axis for yourself.  However, you can get an idea of the kinds of effects cylinder lenses have, in the extreme. by filling a clear glass of water and observing various objects through it.  The glass is a cylinder and it and the water make a very high PLUS cylinder lens. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Weirdeyes</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2016, 23:48</p><p>Some online retailers like to charge extra for prescriptions over +3.75. Will I still get charged extra if I write my prescription in plus cylinder?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Weirdeyes</b>&nbsp;22 Jan 2016, 01:16</p><p>Guess I'll get them adjusted tomorrow. I have some real rayban glasses, so I won't seem too cheap. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2016, 22:18</p><p>Weirdeyes </p><p> Don't worry,any chain optical shop will do it for you,no questions asked.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Weirdeyes</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2016, 12:36</p><p>How do I get over my anxiety about getting my online glasses adjusted? I bought some glasses online. They fit pretty well, but they keep sliding down. I once got my vision tested and they were checking my online glasses. I swear I heard them say online glasses. I also bought some glasses at Costco. I'm thinking of getting my online and Costco glasses adjusted at Costco. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>HighMyopic</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2016, 18:40</p><p>How big are the frames of the black pair? Like the lens holders are 3 or so inches tall and 4 inches wide?  What is the frames of the other pairs like?  Chunky or oversized?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2016, 17:28</p><p>I just have one pair to wear and I keep one spare pair in my bedside cabinet. I have had quite a few pairs over the years but when they either got broken or too scratched I got new ones.  I wear each pair for several years as my prescription doesn't really change.  It's always been this bad!  As we recently moved house all my old glasses got packed away and I am not sure where they are. </p><p></p><hr>

I have often done it myself but the size and base curve of a contact lens is specific to the individual.  Your corneas are very delicate you should be careful not to damage them.    C</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Danbert</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2015, 05:08</p><p>A bit of an epiphany... </p><p> </p><p>I just realised that some sellers on eBay sell generic, not very customisable but nonetheless ridiculously cheap glasses with negative prescriptions! I'm talking less than $2 including postage. So while I wouldn't recommend this as an alternative to proper online retailers where everything can be customised and you can choose nice frames, the prices are unbeatable. </p><p> </p><p>None of these would help anyone with astigmatism or eyes with mismatched prescriptions (though who's stopping you from buying several and trying to swap the lenses around), but would be adequate for many people with moderate prescriptions. </p><p> </p><p>Search for "myopia glasses" on eBay and you should see various results.

<p><b>DS</b>&nbsp;31 May 2015, 20:04</p><p>selectspecs.com is decent.  I've always had excellent results when ordering above the "cheap glasses" line. </p><p> </p><p>The cheap glasses are fine on delivery, but the AR coating crazes with heat such as if left sitting in a car.  I've seen it with three different pairs.  I've also seen the $10 glasses shipped a couple of times with "slightly blemished" frames... like a dark spot from heating during manufacturing on frames with a rubberized material.  It's always been on the inside and not really visible when wearing, but it seems that there might be a stock sort on the incredibly inexpensive purchases. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DWV</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2015, 17:12</p><p>Regarding glasses that won't fold due to thick lenses, I have one pair like that that I picked up at a thrift store.  The optical sales critter must have been a drooling untrained moron to sell that frame to someone with that prescription, since the hinges and temples were arranged so as to fold much closer than normal to the front of the frame (if you see what I mean).  In almost any other frame of a similar size, there would have been no problem.  I bought several other pairs that day that probably came from the same person, and all those folded just fine.  Strength was about -16, with high-index lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2015, 23:31</p><p>Kiki </p><p>I don't know what I should be more impressed by? Your ability to see to drive to and from work wearing glasses that strong, your being able to wear your glasses all day while at work doing much close work or that by the end of the day your still able to take off your glasses and still have perfect uncorrected vision?  </p><p>It's very hard to say at what point your eyes will finally reach a point that they can no longer tolerate even stronger glasses, but since they are doing so well with -3.75 / -4.00 I think increasing by only a -.25 is not nearly enough of a challenge to your eyes and you would hardly notice it at all. I suggest maybe increasing by -.50 or even -.75 if you want to tell a difference in power.  </p><p>I am really amazed that if your constantly either wearing contacts or glasses that your eyes are still prefect and I really don't have any advice on what you can do to create any myopia at this point.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DS</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2015, 21:04</p><p>VP, </p><p> </p><p>The answer is ultimately Minkwitz's Theorem: </p><p>In the vicinity of the corridor, (unwanted) cylinder power lateral to the corridor increases twice as fast as (wanted) add power increases along the corridor. </p><p> </p><p>What this means is that as the transition region is shortened distortion is increased.

<p><b>Andreas</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2015, 22:30</p><p>Hi Kiki  </p><p> </p><p>starting to fancy you. You are really driving your car bareeyed and all your collegues in office only know you as a myope needing minus glasses? Sort of cool. I.m a low myope of -2 and I could only do the other way round: driving in my glasses and squinting my day in office perhaps bareeyed,  so your way of wearing them sounds sort of cool for me. Do you have clear sight bareeyed in the evenings for reading far after wearing them all day?  </p><p> </p><p>Did your collegues comment on your new glasses.  Are they stronger than what you wore there before?  Did you tell anyone your eyes are real bad now as you need -4s now to see? :-) </p><p> </p><p>How do you do if you give a lift to a collegue? I would be scared if a collegue wearing quite some minus prescription in office suddenly puts them away and starts to drive :-). Besides in my case that wouldn.t be safe at all, I could hardly read any sign then or only very late. Fancying your way of wearing,   </p><p> </p><p>Andreas :-) </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kiki </b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2015, 20:33</p><p>Soundmanpt... My sister's glasses are her true prescription with the astigmatism but my glasses are R: -3.75 and L:-4.00, which is the same as hers but I left off the astigmatism! I wanted to bump it up my -.25 each but will have to do that next time!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kiki </b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2015, 20:29</p><p>I wear my glasses from the time I'm pulling out of the driveway until the time I'm leaving work... I work a desk job so mainly computer work, I have no issues wearing them :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2015, 19:19</p><p>Ellie, </p><p>Your post reminded me that some years ago, I tried to order some -14 bifocals from Zenni and wound up with two pair of glasses.  One with the distance prescription and one with the near prescription.   </p><p>It could be that they just don't want to try to stock high sphere lenses with a bifocal ADD, because there is just not enough demand for them. </p><p>This may not be an option for you, but you could try wearing some high minus sphere only contacts, say -8.00 AND use glasses for the rest of your prescription.  Because of vertex distance, you cannot just subtract 8.00 from your glasses prescription, but you may be able to bifocals in the lower prescription glasses.  Just a thought. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ellie</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2015, 18:51</p><p>Anyone know the highest minus rx that can be fitted with bifocals on Zenni? </p><p> </p><p>I tried to put in my glasses rx with an add to see how much a pair of bifocals would cost, but apparently a sphere of -15.50 is too strong to be compatible with bifocals at Zenni. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2015, 17:17</p><p>Kiki </p><p> </p><p>I will be interested in the effect your sisters glasses will gave on your eyes now that there is a slight astigmatism correction for you to deal with.  </p><p>If I recall you said that you quite often wear -2.50 glasses without any problem and your own uncorrected vision is perfect. So the only way to tell if your eyes can tolerate stronger glasses is to try wearing stronger ones. But isn't your sisters new prescription stronger anyway? So by wearing them should be somewhat of a test. If your able to see well with them but get a dizzy feeling then the glasses probably aren't too strong for your eyes but the astigmatism may be too much for you to handle?  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andreas</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2015, 13:15</p><p>Hi Kiki, </p><p> </p><p>How often or for what do you wear those glasses?   </p><p> </p><p>Just curious. Cu Andreas. :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kiki</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2015, 14:51</p><p>I ordered my pair with the same RX as her minus the astigmatism and that's what I've been wearing, I tried hers on and can see just fine but didn't keep them on long! I wanted to order mine slightly stronger but wasn't sure if my eyes could handle it!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2015, 16:22</p><p>Kiki </p><p> </p><p>I was not surprised at all that you intend to wear the one pair. Did you order both pairs in her prescription or did you order yours slightly weaker and without astigmatism correction? I'm sure you must know that when your placing an order you can order in 2 different prescriptions? But if there actually both for her then of course you needed to get them in her prescription. If yo did order both the same and been wearing one of them how do they feel so far? Have you noticed things like the floor seeming to spin or be uneven as well as be a bit sick to your stomach feeling? Your eyes seem to be very able to tolerate moderate distance strength glasses, but it's surprising what just a small amount of CYL (astigmatism) can do to your eyes. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kiki</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2015, 14:14</p><p>I have ordered from Zenni many times but this was the first time I paid extra for quicker shipping! I ordered a pair for both of us and we are quite pleased! She's never ordered from there and thinks they seem kind of cheap but the price is right! I live in central Wisconsin (USA) and can't believe they came as quickly as they did!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2015, 09:27</p><p>Kiki </p><p>Was this your first order with Zenni? I assume you were in a hurry to get your sister (and you) her glasses, but often times even the normal delivery is around 10 days and not more than 2 weeks depending on where your located. So you ordered 2 pairs would it be safe to assume one for your sister and one for yo to wear? You may find that the astigmatism your sister now has may not be comfortable to your eyes and might take some getting used to. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kiki </b>&nbsp;24 Jan 2015, 23:50</p><p>I cannot say enough good things about Zenni! I ordered 2 pair of glasses on Tuesday and paid the $20 extra for 6-8 day shipping with expectations of getting them the first week in February but lo and behold, they were on my front steps on Friday!

<p><b>thebrit</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2014, 05:20</p><p>Ellie &amp; Crystal Veil </p><p>Firstly thank you CV for the pictures you posted of thick lenses bevelled off to make arm folding on certain frames possible. Its a very good idea &amp; besides being practical, it reduces the outer edge thickness quite significantly. I think the myodisc effect is very acceptable, &amp; may be a good choice if the frames are of the semi rimless type. </p><p> </p><p>Ellie, you are obviously pleased with what Zenni have done with your new glasses, &amp; I think I will also give them a try. I totally agree with you about choice of lense index. </p><p>Why pay big bucks for a high index lense, when it may save only a mm or two on the edge thickness, &amp; cost so much more. </p><p>I would rather have the more standard lenses with bevel, &amp; save a lot of bucks!! I am not unduly worried that my lenses are 10/11mm in thickness, as with the correct frame they can look great. I think you are of the same opinion? </p><p>I will try Zenni &amp; post again to let you know how I find them. In the meantime enjoy your new specs!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2014, 01:14</p><p>Ellie </p><p>  A number of years back I dated a girl that had gone from - 11.5 to -14.0 in a period of two years. </p><p>  I remember that when she picked up her new -14.0 glasses that they could not be folded due to the lense thickness. </p><p>  In those days either high index lenses were not available or they were too expensive.Many people were still in glass lenses,and CR-39 were just becoming popular.I don't know for sure,but I think her lenses were glass. </p><p>Additionally there not a lot of frames to accommodate high prescriptions.When we picked up her new glasses she was told that because of the thickness of the lenses,and the position of the hinge,they could not be folded.She was not bothered by this as she said that she wore them constantly,there was never a need to fold them. </p><p>  What did bother her was that due to how much the lenses stuck out on the backside,they had to fashion the nose piece area with nose pads,that the frame did not normally come with,so that the lenses would not rub her nose.The lenses also stuck out almost as much on the front as they did the back,and were her first pair of bioconcave. </p><p>  I thought that they were the sexiest glasses that I had ever seen,but she was very sensitive about how they looked. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2014, 17:06</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>the answer is yes. Even a pair fitted with -19 lenses (albeit 1.67) was able to fold closed. Re the other issue: a few years back, I ordered a giant red pair (279918) fitted with the long distance prescription of my life partner Nel. The glasses arrived with the same kind of beveling shown in the photo on my 2nd weblog and they folded up perfectly. The lenses were 1.57. Nel posed in this pair and then said she would like to have it fitted with progressives but without the beveling. She is fine with posing (and even doing a catwalk or two) in myodisc glasses but she would never wear myodisc glasses in everyday life as long as there are alternatives. Zenni does not make progressives above -10 so I ordered an empty frame for her and then sent it to ciliaryblue to have it fitted with high index (1.74) progressive lenses. When the glasses arrived, it was a shock to both of us that the glasses could not be folded up properly. The arms make 90 degrees (like an x) and that's it. As a result, she hardly ever wears these red glasses. A pity!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2014, 15:30</p><p>Ellie </p><p>You have several very good questions and I think even if your okay with your glasses you should call and ask why the only did one lens and not both?  </p><p>As I said I have always found them very nice about providing answers and they might even send you a complete new pair. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ellie</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2014, 13:55</p><p>Hi everyone, </p><p> </p><p>I got my glasses in the mail today. </p><p>Thanks so much to Crystal Veil for posting the pictures of the beveled lenses. </p><p> </p><p>The rx in the left is -14 and the rx in the right is -14.50. What was sort of weird was that Zenni ended up beveling the right lens, but not the left lens. The left lens is really thick, to the point where the inner "edge" of the glasses touch my nose a bit because they stick out farther than the plastic nosepad itself. </p><p> </p><p>The frames that I got have the hinge set pretty far back to the point where my 13mm left lens closes with no problem. I wonder why they had to bevel the right lens then because the frame still would have closed. </p><p> </p><p>A couple questions: </p><p>1) Anyone else have a similar thing happen to them where one lens is beveled and one isn't? </p><p>2) If I were to order a frame with the hinge that wasn't set very far back at all (for example, a wayfarer style), would Zenni bevel off the same amount of the lens as they did in my case in the frames with the hinges set really far back? </p><p>3) Also, related to question 2, would Zenni bevel off more of the lens if I ordered 1.57 index compared to 1.67 index? Meaning, will my lenses have an even greater myodisc effect with the 1.57 beveling compared to the 1.67 beveling? </p><p>If I'm going to need the lenses beveled with the frames with the hinges set really forward anyway, should I even bother to buy the 1.67 lenses at all? </p><p> </p><p>Sorry for all the questions. Just a few things I've been wondering. I might also send an email to Zenni as well. </p><p> </p><p>Overall, even though at first I thought the glasses looked really weird with only one lens beveled, they're starting to grow on me a bit because they look so unique. One thing that i do miss in the beveled lense though is being able to see the sparkle of the power rings even when you look straight at my face. The power rings are only visible when you look straight at me in my left lens, but not the right. </p><p>I'll show my glasses to my boyfriend later today and see what he thinks!  </p><p> </p><p>Thanks so much for everyone's help! </p><p> </p><p>I really appreciate it. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2014, 10:00</p><p>Crystal Veil  </p><p>Am I correct in saying also that even the strongest that you have gotten from Zenni were able to fold closed and fit fine in the glasses case? You can clearly see the beveled edges on them. I can't see where anyone would have a problem wearing glasses with that look. Yes of course your going to be able to se the bevel but it doesn't look bad at all. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2014, 07:56</p><p>Ellie, thebrit, </p><p> </p><p>I just posted eight photos showing two pairs of Zenni glasses with strong lenses. The first pair (2611) is ideally suited for strong lenses (here -14 / -15) as the frame folds back towards the connection with the arms. The second pair is fitted with lenses of nearly -12 but the frame 2608 could not be closed. The photos show how Zenni beveled the back side of the lenses, almost creating a myodisc effect.  </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://moreladiesbehindcrystalveil.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://moreladiesbehindcrystalveil.blogspot.com/</a> </p><p> </p><p>One of the models who recently posed in the 2611 pair was Juliette in her second photo shoot, early this year.

<p><b>thebrit</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2014, 04:05</p><p>Ellie, </p><p>We seem to be in much the same situation!! </p><p>I have looked at some of my glasses, &amp; can confirm that about 2mm is out the front of the frame &amp; the balance of 8mm is out the back. Obviously with a thicker plastic frame with wide arms you see very little of the back part of the lense. 1 also have some semi rimless metal frames &amp; the back part of the lense shows much more, but when polished they look very good. However I have never had the back edges bevelled, &amp; have no idea what they would look like but I suspect the bevel will show through the lense? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>EyeTri</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2014, 03:14</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>When you get the e-mail notice from Zenni that the glasses have been shipped, if you scroll down you will find a tracking number. Click on this number and you can see tha actual status of the the package. They can get a tracking number before they actually ship the package (eBay people do this a lot). The e-mail goes out when they get the number. </p><p> </p><p>The last glasses I got from Zenni was actually shipped four days after they got the tracking number. The glasses still came in a reasonable period of time, but that is a bit annoying.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>g</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2014, 15:31</p><p>I've got very bad experience with ordering high plus glasses from Zenni. I'm generally very please with their service. But once you go over +6, you should expect them to mess things up. I've got a +6.5 pair that wasn't cut properly (one lens was too big for the frame), and was therefore all twisted. I've ordered once a +8.5 pair and a +10 pair, and the higher one, although a high index lens, again wasn't cur properly, so the lens was too big and twisted the frame (the +8 pair was ok).  </p><p>You should take that into  account when ordering high plus prescriptions from them. These problems are very obvious too see, and there's no way the technician did not notice it was done wrong, so it seems they don't really care.  </p><p>Otherwise, however. I'm very please with their service.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2014, 14:25</p><p>Funny thing is happening as we speak. I placed an order on November the 18th for just 2 pairs of glasses for 2 different people. As you know they always say 2 weeks to arrive. Well I was shocked and pleased to get the e-mail on Monday November the 24th saying they had been shipped. They always send out an e-mail when the glasses ship. From the time you get that e-mail until they arrive in the mailbox over the past 10 years or so you can expect the package with the glasses to be in your mailbox either the next day or the day after sure. So not being there on Tuesday was not surprising but not being there on Wednesday was somewhat surprising, but I just assumed maybe due to Thanksgiving they didn't make. So of course no mail on Thursday Thanksgiving, so I was positive they would be there on Friday, still no package, now it's Saturday and I see the mail lady stop at my box and I could see she only put a letter in my box. I went out to wait for her return back through my subdivision as there is just the one way in and out. When I saw her coling I stopped her and she is really nice and been our mail lady for several years. She suggested I call the local post office and even wrote the number for me. I called and they ran a check and for some reason Zenni put the mail label on as stated that Monday the 24th but they never left Zenni until Friday. Now to be fair they will now be here on monday December 1st and that is still in the 2 week period so they did nothing wrong but I can't imagine why they would hold sending them for nearly a week? Had they really shipped they would have been here on Wednesday the 26th and looked like heroes. Crazy that they can actually take an order get the glasses made in Hong Kong, ship them to the states, reinspect them and have them ready to ship out of California in less than a week, but then waste 4 days getting them picked up by the post office out there. I am going to make a comment to them about it but not a real complaint because they arrived withing the 2 weeks time they claim to deliver in. but I would think they might wonder why it took nearly a full week to have the post office pick them up?  </p><p>But no matter I still highly recommend them as well. I have chatted on live chat as well as on the phone with them and they really are very nice and very helpful with answering any and all questions. I only wish I owned stock in them.        </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2014, 13:56</p><p>I've had nothing but great experiences with Zenni. Unfortunately they do not make glasses in my native Rx, they only go from +12 to -20. However I've ordered many pairs for the glasses I have to wear over my contacts, which mostly just deal with the astigmatism and add for reading. In years past I have also ordered high minus glasses from them, when I used to do GOC with a high Rx minus glasses. They always came out great, and the one time I ordered two pairs but got the Rx wrong on one of them I got a call from them to clarify. </p><p> </p><p>They are fast, cheap and well made. I've never done any custom orders so I'm not sure how they do with these. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2014, 12:13</p><p>Ellie </p><p>Crystal Veil is the perfect one to answer your question best. I think the strongest I have ever had the pleasure of ordering was -11.00 with a fair amount of astigmatisms but she wanted high index so that doesn't help you much only to say her glasses turned out very nice and she loved them. Needless to say they closed up just fine. Really because they mail the glasses out in padded bags the glasses has to be able to fold or they couldn't fit them into a case. Without a case and left open they would likely arrive in several pieces. </p><p>Also the people at Zenni I have found to extremely nice and helpful. So you can do a live chat with them or even a phone call and most times the wait to talk live isn't very long and they even tell you how many callers are ahead of you as you wait but I can tell you they have several that take calls so even if there are 7 ahead of you it will still be only around 10 minutes or so.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>thebrit</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2014, 09:04</p><p>C/V...would like to see some pictures as you propose please</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2014, 04:02</p><p>Ellie, thebrit </p><p> </p><p>over the past five years I ordered many Zenni glasses with lenses above -10. They did a fine job at beveling the edges in some pairs that otherwise would not close properly. No additional cost was charged. I never order high index lenses from Zenni. These glasses are for use at my photo shoots and they also serve as trial frames. After receiving the photos, the model makes her choice and I then order the same pair fitted with her own prescription. I can post the links to some pictures taken during recent photo shoots or take some pics of the glasses from different angles. If the glasses fold up, Zenni leaves the lenses as they are, no matter how thick. I have a couple of pairs in the -14 / -15 range and the lenses are well over a centimeter thick but this does not show as the frames fold back neatly, concealing most of the lens thickness. Hope this helps.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>thebrit</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2014, 02:44</p><p>Hi Ellie, </p><p>Interesting question...I have a similar problem as my lenses are 10mm thick. I suspect some of the lense will be out front but most of it out the back of the frame. They could bevel the edges but I dint know what it would look like?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ellie</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2014, 01:56</p><p>Anyone have experience with ordering really thick lenses from Zenni? </p><p>The frames that I'm thinking about ordering do not have the hinges set far back enough that the glasses would close.  </p><p>Does anyone know how the glasses would turn out? Would Zenni set the lenses forward or would they shave off the sides? Would they consider just not closing the glasses and letting the lenses stick out as far back as needed? </p><p> </p><p>Thanks!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;19 Sep 2014, 13:39</p><p>JDug. </p><p>They appear to be adjustable power glasses based on the principles either two sliding lenses with variable power or a clever fluid filled lens design where you can change the power by controlling the pressure of the fluid inside the lens.    They do not state exactly the lens power range, but ideally the lens power would be from perhaps -2.00 to perhaps +3.00.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2014, 16:28</p><p>Nathalie </p><p> </p><p>Okay then if you normally wear your glasses both for up close and for distance then you do want to mark it as being "distance" where it asks that. </p><p>Sorry for all the confusion, but just wanted to be sure exactly waht you were using your glasses for.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nathalie</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2014, 12:52</p><p>Hi, </p><p>I have had glasses previously. They do help in the distance, I just never ordered on that website. I have ordered on clearly contacts and was never asked that preciision. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks, </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2014, 12:47</p><p>Nathalie </p><p>When they checked your eyes did you need any correction for distance? Of course if you did that could be put in the top instead of no prescription in the top.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2014, 12:44</p><p>Nathalie </p><p> </p><p>Okay I tried to go into that site where your planning on ordering your glasses from and it wouldn't allow me to even get into anything for some reason. I was curious why it is even asking that question. I wanted to see if it asks you for a P.D. (pupil distance) measurement or not. The only difference I can think of is that reading glasses would have a slightly smaller P.D. measurement than distance glasses would have.  </p><p>For example if you look at Zenni's site (zennioptical.com) they ask for a P.D. measurement and they only ask if the glasses are single vision or bifocals.   </p><p>Not to further confuse things but it seems you have never wore glasses before and these will be your first? Being in school and needing glasses for reading you might be better off just getting a pair of progressives (bifocals) That way you have the top part which you would use for seeing distances with as plain without any prescription and the lower part having the +2.50 for reading with. that way you can keep your glasses on as much as you like and be able to see distances just fine and also be able to read close up. If you get them from Zenni you can find a buge choice for under $55.00. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nathalie</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2014, 12:18</p><p>Thanks Soundmanpt, </p><p>Do they actually make the lenses differently if you qualify them as reading instead of distance?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2014, 12:10</p><p>Nathalie </p><p>So if then your intending to wear them most of the time. So in that case you should say distance even though they are mostly going to be for reading and seeing close up. But your eyes should be able to adjust to them for distance after you wear them for a while. Your prescription is +2.50 plus lenses will make everything appear big with your glasses on. but at first they will be fine for close up but blurry when you look in the distance with them on. This will slowly clear up the more you wear them. If you had minus lenses then everything would appear to be small but very sharp with your glasses on.  </p><p>Now if you were only going to wear them for reading only then you should call them reading glasses and not distance.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nathalie</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2014, 08:41</p><p>Hi, I will be using the glasses in class, computer work, reading tv. Probably all the time.  </p><p>What is the difference between reading and distance lenses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2014, 07:38</p><p>Nathalie </p><p>Your farsighted (long sighted) and it seems you wear your glasses for more than just reading close up or at least your intending to with your new glasses? So you are fine to say distance. </p><p></p><hr>

I also got myself ordered 20 pD prism - it came from Essilor in Portugal for about 80 USD. First lenses weren´t excellent but the second pair is fine. I have got many pairs of prism glasses in excellent quality that bring absolutely crystal vision.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2014, 16:16</p><p>New Prism, </p><p>Optical 4 less, used to have a special makings department, but I thnk they closed it several years ago.  Essentially, with 0.00 Sphere and -0.25 cylinder, your glasses are almost pure prism.  There may be another way to do this that i would prefer to discuss privately.  May I ask you to contact me privately at cactusjack1928@hotmail.com </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>New Prism</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2014, 12:23</p><p>CJ, thank you for the reply. </p><p>My full prescription only has -0.25 cylinder per eye and no sphere.  </p><p>Do you have any experience with optical4less? Can they really produce 10 prisms or they make less (6 to 7) as they stated in the email? </p><p>Problem is I can't find even an offline shop that would produce 15 bo prisms. Up to 5 I was fine. Now I have hard time finding even ones that would make 10. Before I ordered 10 BO per eye from eyeglasses factory outlet and they were satisfactory but I planned on using optical4less now (nicer frames) or any source that could make high prisms. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2014, 11:30</p><p>New Prism, </p><p>Could you provide the complete prescription for the glasses you are trying to order?   </p><p>Glasses with about 10 BO in each eye are very hard to make and fit properly.  The difficulty increases exponentially as you go above 10 BO. The difficulty increases if there is significant Sphere and or Cylinder.  I was told by one Dispensing Optician (the person who adjusts and delivers your glasses) that they have had re-order glasses with 15/15 BO as many as 5 times to provide the patient with marginally acceptable visual acuity and often the laboratory had to remake the lenses several times before they had lenses that would pass their internal Quality Assurance tests and send them to him. Which explains why high prism glasses are expensive.  They HAVE to cover their costs and make a profit to stay in business and every lens that fails inspection is money in the trash.  High prism lenses have very thin inside edges and they often break when mounting the lenses in the frame.  The business model of online retailers will not support a very low volume business with a very high spoilage rate.  So they just decline the opportunity to loose money. </p><p>Typically, very complex lenses are made by a handful of specialty labs who only work through certain Dispensing Opticians.  The business is hard enough when working through well trained and experienced Opticians. Even their specialty business model won't work if they tried to deal with the general public.   </p><p>Making and fitting high prism glasses is an Art and it is rapidly becoming a LOST ART as the people who know how to make and fit high prism glasses retire or die. </p><p>C. </p><p>P.S.  You are right to reject Fresnel press ons.  They have a purpose, they also introduce severe distortion which makes reading with them almost impossible.  They are fine for children who can't read and have eye conditions where they are very useful.  They are marginally useful in adults where Visual Acuity is important. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>New Prism</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2014, 08:53</p><p>I have one question if anyone can help me out. </p><p>I have recently unsuccessfully tried to order glasses with 15 BO prisms per eye. </p><p>Does anyone know if there is any online retailer that would produce this prescription?  </p><p>I have tried contacting optical4less with this request. However, I received a reply that maximum they can make is 6 or 7 prisms per eye (and they really wrote "6 or 7"). I find this strange since on their online prescription form you can choose up to 10. Did anyone order their glasses with 10 prisms? If so, did you try measuring prisms to see if the prescription is correct? From their answer it seems that they would just put 6 or 7 prisms for anyone that orders 10.  </p><p>I just want to be on a safe side before I order from them. I can get away with 10 BO for close up but I really would need 15 to be able to see full time and I am trying to avoid fresnel prisms that my doctor advised.  </p><p>Thank you.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>HighMyopic</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2014, 23:45</p><p>What is the number one zennioptical glasses frame that will have the thickest -20 diopter 1.56 mid index lenses?  I have been looking a bunch and have found a frame that can have 21.1 mm thick lenses.  I am also looking for the biggest frame possible and the lowest possible PD. Is there a frame that can top that lense thickness?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2014, 07:46</p><p>Right now I am wearing my 25-year-old Liz Claiborne clear plastic trapezoid-shaped frames, which back then cost a little over 100 simoleons complete.  That was my first-ever clear frame.  My favorite frame that is neither drop-temples nor cat's-eyes is a light blue Alberto Pucci frame, bought in 1987 for about the same price, one that I could probably sell for $1000 if I wanted to (and I do not).  And last year I was able to get a pair of black Ray-Ban cat's-eyes for $100.  That's it for my designer frames.  Of course, I have several pairs of drop-temples that cost $29.95 complete 30 years ago.  For me, price and quality are more important than having some unpronounceable name or odd logo on my frames.</p><p></p><hr>

I am only making a point that because they control so much of the optical world just as the video said they are selling glasses for more than 20 times what they need to sell for. Yes of course if the customers are willing to pay that much so be it. If it is that important for someone to wear glasses with the designer's name on the temples that they have no problem paying several hundred dollars to become a human billboard of sorts its fine with me.  </p><p>I hope everyone takes the time to watch the video you included and they can make up their own mind. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2014, 05:59</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>the monopolist company in question has its headquarters in the Italian Dolomites. </p><p> </p><p>By the way, some months ago you considered doing a few photo shoots with ladies in the know. Have you made any progress with this idea? I certainly would welcome an influx of original content. To quote Alain in an email exchange after I started my project: "I was beginning to feel lonely" :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2014, 18:07</p><p>Revolver </p><p> </p><p>I do agree that many of the optical stores now are taking the on line retailers as a serious threat. But oddly enough the ones that are revolting, at least in regards to providing a PD, are all owned by the same company and I might add the most expensive as well. Lenscrafter's, Pearle Vision, Target Optical, JC Penny, Sears optical and even Sunglass Hut are all owned by the very same company. Not to mention they also own many of the expensive designer frames they sell at very high prices. Just to name a few include Ray-Ban, and Oakley plus many others. You can also include that they now even have their own vision insurance called Eyemed. I'm sorry but they need to be challenged so they maybe will decide to stop over charging for everything. Talk about corporate greed, that is what I call corporate greed. Oh and if your wondering they are not headquartered in the US either. I believe they are in Italy or France. The CEO was interviewed about 6 or 7 months ago by 60 minutes and he really didn't like being asked many of the questions he was asked.  </p><p>My suggestion is if your considering ordering glasses on line before you call one of the mentioned stores to get an eye exam you may want to ask if they will not only provide you with your prescription, which by law they have to do, but also your PD? If they refuse thank them and call a local shop or a Wal-Mart, you won't have much trouble finding a place to get what you need.  </p><p>It could be that it is the company policy not to do adjustments on any glasses not purchased at that store. I don't have a problem with that if that is indeed the case. But it seems the optician was on the rude side which is unnecessary.  </p><p>The best way to adjust the nose pads on a rimless pair of glasses is to use a plier's with cushions and hold it by the bridge of the glasses and slowly bend the nose pads as desired.    </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2014, 14:47</p><p>As it turns out, the optician at BJ's is also the optical department manager.  BJ's doesn't sell rimless glasses, so they knew right away they didn't come from BJ's.  I would think that as a courtesy to any BJ's customer, they would have adjusted the glasses.  It was my idea to have them adjusted there.  My wife was apprehensive having that obnoxious optician even touch her glasses because she was afraid her fat fingers would just get in the way.  No big deal though.  We belong to Sam's Club and Costco and can go to their optical departments where the staff is much friendlier and not reluctant to work on glasses that did not originate from their store.  We are not talking major adjustments here, just bending a piece of wire.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2014, 13:47</p><p>I disagree with Sounder, other than a call to the manager may be in order.  More and more opticals, from the independents to the chains, are being forced to charge for routine services due to prescriptions going out the door to online companies with which they can't compete due to overhead. There have been at least two serious articles in respected optical trade journals making the point that they can't give away services like they used to because of online competition.  One went so far as to publish a suggested list for everything from adjustments to providing PD's.  </p><p> </p><p>By all means make that call, but don't be surprised if it is indeed store policy set by management.  The other thing is what are the lenses made of?  Plastics are very prone to cracking and if that did happen the onus would be on the optician to provide a replacement, an expensive proposition for no return whatsoever.  Most independent labs now highly recommend polycarb or Trivex for drill and/or compression mounts for that reason although if pushed, they will provide plastic but with a disclaimer.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2014, 09:25</p><p>Stingray </p><p> </p><p>If I were you I would simply place a call to the store manager and make a complaint about that optician. I really doubt that is the policy that "BJ's" has. I really hope you and your wife made a point of letting him know that your fine if he didn't wish to make a simple adjustment, but because of his attitude you will never be a customer of their optical dept. </p><p>I'm sorry that happened to her, but I assure you that what happened their was by no means how most optical stores will respond. I urge you and your wife to try another optical store. I think you will find he was indeed full of "BS" as you thought.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2014, 09:15</p><p>Soundmanpt: My wife's glasses arrived yesterday, less than 2 weeks after ordering them from Zenni.  She loved the way they looked on her, but found that the nose pads were pressing into her nose, causing discomfort.  I really didn't want to mess with them, as I am no optician.  We went to BJ's wholesale club where they have an optical department and a morbidly obese obnoxious optician.  When my wife asked her politely for an adjustment, she refused saying they were not purchased at BJ's and she would have to return them to where she got them from.  Well, we can't send them back to China or Zenni because they have to be done on a face to face situation.  The BJs optician said that any little adjustment would crack the lens.  Sounds like BS at BJ's!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2014, 18:03</p><p>High Myopic, </p><p> </p><p>to be honest, I have no idea. The -19 glasses arrived as myodiscs but perhaps with one difference: they flattened the lens enough for the glasses to be folded up neatly. They did the same thing with a couple of glasses with Rx -12. On the other hand, a couple of pairs ordered with Rx -14 / -15 arrived without the flattening, just very thick at the edges. These were frames that bent back at the sides, leaving enough space for the thick edges of the lenses. It did not matter to me as all these glasses were only meant for use at photo shoots, not for use in daily life. I always send Zenni a note that the strong glasses are not for use in everyday life. This saves a lot of Q&amp;A.;  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2014, 15:12</p><p>High Myopic </p><p> </p><p>The site is simply "zennioptical.com"  Alos if you scrol down the page on the left side you can chat with a real person that will be able to answet any of your questions Also I suggest that when you place your order you use the "comment" box for any special request. Zenni is very good at working with your request. I have even had then call be if they something that didn't look exactly right to them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>HighMyopic</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2014, 11:50</p><p>Do you have to contact/email zennioptical to get the myodisc option for your glasses?  Or if you select the high index option  the glasses will automatically be myodiscs and you pay more for them?   Can you select the bowl size in mm of the myodiscs that you want?   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2014, 09:27</p><p>Anton, </p><p> </p><p>the answer is yes. Three years ago, I ordered a pair of Zenni glasses with Rx -19.25 / R: -19.75, high index 1.67. These arrived as myodisc glasses. You can see these glasses on the first page of my weblog "Lovely ladies behind crystal veil" (Juliette 270 - 275). If my memory serves me correctly, the price of the glasses was between $40 and $50. Also, over the years, Stephan has listed many Zenni glasses for sale, fitted with myodisc lenses, Rx -20.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anton</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2014, 04:53</p><p>I was wondering if anybody knows if its possible to order myodisc glasses online at Zennit or any of the other online retailers. Thanks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;29 May 2014, 21:58</p><p>I have ordered three different pairs of glasses from Zenni and all seem to be perfect and the price is very resonable.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 May 2014, 15:33</p><p>Stingray </p><p> </p><p>Now to be honest with you the glasses offered by Zenni are also made in China, but I think it is very important to note that the glasses are first checked while still in China and then they are sent to the home office of Zenni which is located in California and they again are checked to be sure there is no mistake in the prescription. I very well recall when I first started placing orders with them I had the very same concerns you and your wife have about how accurate the prescription would be. So when i came across various prescriptions including bifocals as well as some with a high astigmatisms I would take them to friends I have that are still opticians. They were constantly perfect. I very well recall going to my local Sears Optical and having my friend compare the lenses on the glasses to the prescription slip. She came back and said she only wished her lab did nearly as well. She was very impressed. Now something I don't think you will be needing to worry about but lets just say for some reason, maybe nothing more than when your wife sees the color she isn't happy with them. You can return them for 50% of what you paid for them with no questions asked. I only ever had to return glasses to Zenni and had no problem getting the refund. Zenni did nothing wrong, my customer / patient was being changed from having a very weak prescription for astigmatisms to more of a plus prescription and she just struggled trying to focus distances with them. She had gotten 3 pairs. I even took the glasses to where she got her eyes examined and had them check to be sure the glasses were made correct and once again they were dead on per the optician. I resolved the problem by reordering just one pair and cutting the rx in half so her eyes could adjust better to them. That solved the problem. Actually Zenni was really even nicer than they needed to be. The policy is that you need to return them withing a month or less to get the partial refund. This young lady had the glasses for over 3 months before she got them back to me so I could return them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;29 May 2014, 14:01</p><p>Soundmanpt:  Thanks for your input.  My wife is very wary of online eyeglass retailers.  She once got this pair from a company called 5 star optical.  She loved the frames and they offered a good price on progressive lenses, like $100 including the frame and photochromatic lenses as well.  However, their optical plant was in China.  The glasses when they arrived looked nice, but something was off and my wife said they made her dizzy.  I sent them back to China for a re-do and they came back the same, so we ate the $100 I spent on them.  She just got a pair of rx sunglasses from our optometrist which cost nearly $600!  What a rip-off.  $197 for each lens and my wife is only a -3.00.  So with skepticism, I found these nice frames on Zenni, she liked them as well and we are taking a chance they will come out correctly.  Based on what you said, it appears that they have great quality control on their eyewear.  I hope you are right.  I will give you an update when they arrive.  What is their usual turn-around time?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 May 2014, 01:32</p><p>Stingray </p><p>Yes #251321 would be easy for any optician to adjust by pushing together or separating the nose pads to allow the frame to be lower or higher on the nose. In most cases if any adjustment is needed it should only be by a few millimeters.  </p><p>I think the these glasses in fact have just what Revolver was describing as to how the lenses are held to the bridge as well as the temples. </p><p>By the way I like what you have selected and they should make for great looking glasses.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;28 May 2014, 13:15</p><p>Stingray: those are called compression mounts, no nut underneath just two tiny posts, it can usually be pressed back into place.  Carefully, of course.  It's possible the plastic part could be worn in which case it can be replaced.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;27 May 2014, 19:45</p><p>Soundmanpt: Thanks for the response.  It would be rimless glasses.  Do they typically polish the edges of the lenses?  If you could look at frame 251321, can you tell me if that particular bridge can be adjusted if necessary?  Just another question if you don't mind.  My wife has a pair of rimless that she loves, only the problem is that one of the lenses is loose.  Rather than a screw and nut configuration, it has on the inside of the lens what appears to be a plastic cap that holds the lens screw on.  Any suggestions on how to tighten that cap?  Is there a nut, under that cap?  Thanks again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 May 2014, 11:33</p><p>Stingray </p><p> </p><p>I have over the past 9 or 10 years placed orders fro several hundred pairs of glasses including progressives and have honest;y never had even one problem with Zenni.  </p><p>Somethings I do always recommend to anyone getting progressives is that because of the positioning of the bifocal it is always a better idea to get glasses that have the adjustable nose pads such as semi-rimless or rimless offers. There is a few plastic frames that also have the adjustable nose pads. This allows some adjustment up and down of the bifocal segment. A molded plastic frame with nose pads that can't be adjusted limits any adjusting by an optician </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;27 May 2014, 10:13</p><p>Has anyone ever ordered from Zenni optical and has a bad experience with them?   Not so much customer service, but incorrect prescription issues especially with progressive lenses.  </p><p></p><hr>

The blur is tremendously strong but it gets even stronger if I put my own glasses on underneath these ones.  Is that because it corrects my 6 prescription and makes the glasses stronger for me?  These glasses are best I ever had and I wear them very often in private.

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;24 Jan 2014, 12:31</p><p>Aleja; sounds like quite the good deal on some high Rx glasses.

Let us know! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aleja</b>&nbsp;24 Jan 2014, 11:09</p><p>I enjoy wearing good strong glasses because I find it very stimulating.  Usually I get some thrills from the thrift store, but they are usually weaker lenses.  My eyes are only -6, but I wanted something extremely strong to try out.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2014, 17:41</p><p>Clare </p><p>Very simple. What would you do now if you were say in another city and you accidently fell asleep with them on. When you wake up your glasses are now out of shape and sit very crooked on your face? Well if you don't have an answer for that, just in case that should ever happen to you, you would simply find the closest optical shop and they will gladly adjust them back into shape for you without any charge. So that applies the same way if you order prescription sunglasses and they need to be fitted a little better for you.  </p><p>Remember my recommendation about ordering a good size to begin with. I'm quite sure you have a nice pair of non prescription sunglasses you wear with your contacts. So measure them using a ruler that is in millimeters. The first and most important measurement is across the front, or face, measure from the outside left to the outside right and then simply compare that number to glasses you see on line. I will look up several styles that I have ordered for people that make great sunglasses from Zenni. But of course you may find a lot of others as well. Just remember that anything you see that shows up as regular glasses can be sunglasses as well. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>aviator -oo-</b>&nbsp;25 Dec 2013, 14:06</p><p>A Happy Christmas to all Eyescene posters. As a present to myself, I recently ordered about 12 new frames with a range of minus RX lenses from Zenni. The package arrived on Christmas Eve, but I waited until today to open it. All was in order, and I am pleased to report that the plastic cases they use now have an attractive Paisley type pattern on them, and the lens cloths are decorated with images too. As a present for a few friends, I also ordered some frames with a zero RX and a tint, together with the recipient's name type printed on the temple. The type turned out a bit small for my liking, but it is subtle if that is the effect you want.  Zenni continue to offer the best value for money of any on-line retailer I know of; I just wish they would refresh their range of frames.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mark</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2013, 21:38</p><p>thanks guys, I checked zenni and they're cheaper as well</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2013, 14:37</p><p>If I had a choice I'd choose Zenni. I've always had good luck with them, and it seems they do minus up to -20. They are more limited in plus lenses, topping out at +12 which is too low for me. </p><p> </p><p>I also just checked greateyeglasses.com and tried to order a +20 just to see what happened. When I went to check out I got a window saying that my SPH was a special case and I needed to call them. I've had to do this anyway in previous orders, but there didn't used to be a popup window telling me I had to do so. </p><p> </p><p>In any case, I've gotten glasses from both places and overall the better experience was from Zenni. They even once noticed a mistake in my Rx and called me to verify. I wish they did high plus these days, but they don't. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2013, 12:41</p><p>Clare </p><p>I'm not sure when your due for your next eye check but if it is getting close you may want to hold off until then in case there is any change in your prescription. When you go besides getting your full prescription for glasses in writing be sure to have them provide you with your P.D. measurement. All the on line places will need that. I assume you know what that is? But just in case. It is when they measure the distance between your pupils.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2013, 11:48</p><p>Clare </p><p>Okay I can help you with that since i have ordered many hundreds of glasses on line.  </p><p>The best way is to take a pair of your glasses that you feel best fits your face. Find a ruler that has millimeters on it, and measure your glasses across the front from the outside left to the outside right. In most cases for the average size woman and face they should be between 125mm and 132mm. Now when you find a pair of glasses that your interested in most of the on line retailers provide an "overall width" meaning across the front of the frame. Compare that to your glasses that you measured and if it is close then they should be a good fit. In most cases the on line retailer also provides other measurements as well such as the height of the lenses, the width of the lens and the length of the temple (arms)and even the bridge (across the nose). But generally the most critical is the overall width. If you happen to be looking at an on line retailer that doesn't provide an overall measurement you may be able to e-mail them and have them provide that to you. As you know I still highly recommend Zenni and they do provide the overall measurement.  </p><p>Also if your considering Zenni, they offer 2 lens options that are both at are "free" options.  1.50 and 1.57 Since I know you want your lenses thinner rather than thicker I recommend the 1.57 lens. Unless your prescription changes a good bit more than it is now there is no need to go with any thinner lenses as your prescription isn't enough to need it.  </p><p>Here are 3 choices that I seem to get a lot of orders for that come from Zenni  #339121,  #262621, and #335221. but there are several thousand to choose from.  </p><p>Also Zenni has a pretty good return policy in case you get your glasses and don't like them for any reason. They will return 50% of what you paid for them with no questions asked so even if you get them and you don't like the color you can return them. You just need to return them within a month.  </p><p>Since your now wearing your glasses more than these days you should consider getting several pairs. With many of them being less than $20.00 (including the AR coating) getting 3 or 4 pairs is still far less what you would pay at an optical store.  </p><p>If you need any help, please let me know. I will be more than happy to help you.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2013, 10:54</p><p>If you order online what happens with fitting? I imagine they could come too large or wide, then what would you do?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2013, 10:33</p><p>I've used greateyeglasses.com in the past and have been very happy with them.

The easiest way for most to know about how well a pair of glasses will fit them is by measuring their own glasses, in millimeters, and then comparing that overall width with the glasses on line. Specs Depot doesn't give that final size. They do give a lens width and the bridge but it doesn't include the outside of the frame edges which has to be considered as well. </p><p>I just sent them an email asking them why they don't provide that as well. Other wise if I find some that I think would be good for me to include in my samples I will have to first contact them and have them do an actual measurement for me.  </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;13 Aug 2013, 12:22</p><p>Hi Juicebox </p><p>Both my eye tests and all 3 pairs of glasses (my first ones +1 and +0.75 prescription and my 2 current pairs +1.50 and +1.75 prescription) all done/bought from a local independent optician. I have looked in Specsavers but I haven't bought anything from them, not to say I wouldn't in the future. I think my girlfriend bought her rimless glasses from Specsavers as she has a Specsavers case with them in. She already had these glasses when we got together and no longer wears them since getting a stronger prescription. She got her new glasses from an independent optician. </p><p>I have also been in another well known chain and an assistant steered me towards the children's section!(yes, the children's section, not even the teens section!) I know I'm petite but I didn't think I looked that young, especially with my bust! Maybe, to be fair, they thought I had a small head and that children's glasses would fit me better. Luckily some adult frames do fit me (I couldn't see myself with Barbie glasses, somehow! Ha Ha)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>juicebox</b>&nbsp;12 Aug 2013, 20:36</p><p>Carrie, </p><p>Since you're in the UK, where do you get your glasses? I always go to Specsavers for eye tests but tend to not get glasses from them. At least in there they point me towards the teenage section, and not the general kids section :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Aug 2013, 19:01</p><p>Carrie and KL  </p><p>I have to agree with you both, for some reason it is really hard to find very many frames that are on the smallish side. Zenni who I favor a lot due to price and past history has great prices but not nearly enough small frames. I come across more young ladies just like yourselves that are on the petite side and need smaller glasses. I think I have about ordered every small size they offer so i can have samples. For too many are 130mm and over. I have several right now that really need more around 125mm or 126mm and they only have a very few and not the most stylish in those sizes. Most are more interested in plastic frames and yes you can get rimless or wire frame in smaller sizes. I have complained to Zenni quite often about the need for smaller sizes. </p><p></p><hr>

I always feel weird when the optician mentions I'm perhaps better looking in the kids section, I'm not a hipster so having Barbie on my glasses would not be some sort of ironic statement!  I don't think you mentioned where you are based but I'm in the UK so that's where I was looking online for a second pair. (After months of searching I managed to find a 51mm prada frame that's slightly tapered so its not too wide at the bottom but is a bit at the top!). I found a website that does petite versions of a lot of its frames, so they're the adult frames, just smaller. ( <a href="http://www.specspost.co.uk/catalogue/petite-glasses" target="_blank">http://www.specspost.co.uk/catalogue/petite-glasses</a> ) They ship internationally, so if you're not UK based, it's no problem.

Also around -3 as far as I can remember, but progressives - she's older than me (hey Carrie, another lesbian here. hehe) </p><p> </p><p>Now, I've bought glasses from Zennioptical several times, and have mostly been happy with the quality. My problem is that I have a very narrow face, and even their smallest women's frames are plenty big enough on me. I currently have this: <a href="http://www.zennioptical.com/?nav_cat_id=2&amp;q=463621&amp;navused=1" target="_blank">http://www.zennioptical.com/?nav_cat_id=2&amp;q;=463621&amp;navused;=1</a> but it's getting a bit worn, and as it's been several years I'm also bored with it. I haven't found many alternatives on Zenni. The kids' frames would probably work except the temples would be too short. </p><p> </p><p>So, does anyone have recommendations for where I might find a better selection of frames to suit a really narrow face on an adult head? </p><p> </p><p>I'd appreciate any suggestions.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John S</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2013, 17:57</p><p>NJ, </p><p>A friend of mine is the manager of a very small independent retail store (3 employees).  </p><p>I had researched what office progressive lens would work out the best for computer use, since I liked a strong add. I decided on the Shamir Office 225 lens for several reasons. I chose CR-39 of course, in a kind of semi-rimless Nike frame. </p><p>I determined what I thought would be a good compromise for the RX. I said I wanted this lens, and handed him the frame, and the RX I had calculated. I told him if he beat the online services, he got the job. He did it for $100, with scratch and UV.  </p><p>I ended up adding another +.50 to my distance rx. The RX came out perfect. He never looks at my file, he just asks for the RX I want. Everybody needs a friend like that.  </p><p>By looking at the websites, both labs can do some really cool stuff. Let me know how things work out. Being an end user, they will probably say "no returns". You can't blame them either... </p><p>John</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2013, 14:46</p><p>@John S.: Dunno...I know that they will send you the uncut lenses, which you can take to an optical store to be placed in frames. That's what I have done in the past with other labs. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2013, 13:54</p><p>It's been hit and miss on the full field plus lenses at this Rx...Used to be that the largest FF lens was made by Signet Armorlite and came in a 16 base. Now it looks like some manufacturers in China go up to +20 on a FF lens.  </p><p> </p><p>GreatEyeglases.com made me a nice pair of +20 in a FF lens with a good sized add, so I tried to order another pair in a slightly larger frame (53mm vs 55mm) but it came back in a lenticular lens with the seg height way too low.  </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, just be specific and get it in writing so that you can return the glasses if you don't like them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2013, 11:08</p><p>NJ:  Thanks for the heads up.  I will give them a try.  I don't much like their frame selection. </p><p> </p><p>I'm trying to find as big an eye size as possible at +17, while getting a full-field lens, so as to have a complete image of the hugely magnified eyes visible to the onlooker.  That's what fascinates me about plus glasses:  Two ridiculously magnified eyes, way too close together, that sweep this way and that trying to deal with their restricted visual field. </p><p> </p><p>I'll never understand it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;31 May 2013, 04:08</p><p>I've got a couple of pairs of glasses that have arms that don't properly due to the thick lenses, and both times they've come with an elastic band around the glasses case. The case almost closes on both pairs, with the arms sticking out a little more than they should do, so the case doesn't click shut. </p><p> </p><p>I've found a way around this is to just get a bigger case which does shut - don't know why the opticians didn't think of this in the first place, with even an established optician like Specsavers falling foul of this on one count, with their own branded case which my other half changed for a Dior case which was about the twice the height of the aforementioned case. </p><p> </p><p>We have also once had a pair of frames that I wanted to be reglazed with my other half's prescription refused by an online optician because they said the lenses would be too thick, and the arms wouldn't shut properly. Why they wouldn't just grind down the lens edge so they would shut I don't know, but maybe they were worried about the thickness of the edge of these lenses in the semi rimless frame they were intended for.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ellie</b>&nbsp;31 May 2013, 02:28</p><p>Has anyone ever ordered a pair of glasses with lenses that were so thick that the temples wouldn't close? I'm just curious as to how companies would ship those glasses to you. Usually online companies include a glasses case, but I guess if the glasses can't close, that might not be useful. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;20 May 2013, 13:50</p><p>Can anyone comment on the lens quality between these companies? price would be secondary to me and I'll probably be sending out various older frames to test them all before I figure out who to put the main order with </p><p> </p><p>My biggest peeve is smudging and lenses that are hard to clean or see out of. My fave is basically Zenni, great price and very good quality for what you get if you get the coatings etc. Even without they are pretty decent. 39DollarGlasses is also decent (but bad frame selection) as well as EyeBuyDirect, but Firmoo is absolutely atrocious. Seriously.. with Firmoo they came smudged and fogged like hell and no amount of cleaning would really improve anything.   </p><p> </p><p>I am wearing a pair right now that are lens changed from a local independent optician and I'm not not that impressed. They claim to use Sola, Essilor etc but what I have are decent if they can be cleaned but pretty smudgy most of the time. I paid more and got inferior to online/china lenses. The quality can vary allround.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John S</b>&nbsp;18 May 2013, 21:53</p><p>The pricing is correct for SV lenses. LensesRX is really high on progressives. JEM Optical has much better pricing for progressives than any of the three shops listed. JEM uses AO lenses, not off shore products.  </p><p>I think their frame selection is pretty poor. But if you are sending in your own frame, they offer a reasonably priced replacement service that is good quality. You can also specify the fitting height. I have not found any other shop that has good prices that will do that. </p><p>I ordered a complete pair from Goggles4U, the PD was 8mm too wide. They argued with me about my rx. I don't understand the relationship between my RX and PD. Now I see they are offering lens replacement. They won't get my business.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jacko</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2013, 08:45</p><p>Soundmanpt  : they have free shipping if you order 3 or more pairs.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2013, 23:44</p><p>Jacko </p><p> </p><p>Seems very reasonable from what I could tell. The shipping is as much as many of the glasses are. I just picked out one to see waht the total price would be and the total including shipping was only $16.00 and that included AR coating.  </p><p>I will have to keep them in mind a and give them a real order in the future.  </p><p>I do have a question as I didn't try this. How much do they charge for shipping if your ordering several pairs at one time? For example Zenni only charges a flat $49.5 no matter if you order one pair or 50 pairs the shipping is always only $4.95 total. In some cases that is how you can get burned because they will charge a delivery for each pair ordered. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2013, 20:23</p><p>Clare </p><p> </p><p>Your more than welcome. Was everything understandable about getting a proper fit?  </p><p>Because of the drying out issues you seem to have it is probably a good idea to give your yes more rest from contacts. I am not saying give up on them but limit how long you wear them.  </p><p>I think I may have told this before but someone I am good friends with a several year ago was complaining about the fact that every spring her eyes were killing her due to allergies. She had glasses however she claimed they were several prescriptions old and not really much good anymore. okay for around the house but any real distance was not at all clear with them. I told her I could help her get new glasses but she needed to provide a glasses prescription. This went on for a couple years and then finally one day when I went to say hello to her, she was and still is a manager of a large chain jewelery store, I was surprised that she was wearing glasses. I could tell they were very new. I complemented her on how nice they looked and she told me she had taken my advice and ordered glasses from my favorite place. Zenni. But what was even more surprising was that she ordered not one pair but 8 pairs. She has not worn contacts since then. She even had a small change in her prescription and she again went in and ordered 8 more pairs and she admitted she had 4 more she was still thinking about getting. Her co workers call her a "diva" now. But several of them have also got glasses from there as well, but not 8 pairs.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2013, 14:41</p><p>Thanks Soundmanpt, all that information was very helpful. Both my contacts and glasses prescriptions are current as they are from September last year.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2013, 11:45</p><p>Clare </p><p>One last thing you will need a current glasses prescription that is within the past year. Do not use your contact prescription as there can sometimes be slight differences between your contacts and glasses. Also you will need your PD measurement as well. You can get this from where you got your last glasses from. It of course is the distance between your pupils.  </p><p>So if your planning on getting new glasses because your going for an eye exam be sure to get these things.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2013, 11:40</p><p>Clare </p><p>Sorry I forgot to answer your other question about if they get loose. </p><p>Well that is very easy. just like your current glasses if you were out and found that they were sliding down you could stop at any optical shop and they will always adjust your glasses fro you. It is just good business. I had people come in and all they wanted was to have their glasses cleaned. So lets say you got glasses on line and they were nice but needed adjusting so they were not slipping down or too tight even Just take them anywhere and ask if they could adjust them for you.  </p><p>Just a helpful tip for you and others. Something that nearly every glasses wearer has had happen is for a screw to work loose and even fall out. A great way to keep this from happening is to first have the screws tightened on your glasses or do it yourself with an eyeglass screwdriver. When they are tight take a small drop of clear fingernail polish on the head of the screw Don't overdo this and be careful not to get any on your lenses. This will keep the screws from working their way loose. Of course never use glue of any kind. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2013, 11:29</p><p>Clare  </p><p>Let me help you with that. I know your actually very happy with your current glasses as you have wore this pair more than any other glasses you have ever had. So that means you like the fit. So that said take out a ruler that has millimeters on it. Take off your glasses if your wearing them and measure everything on your glasses. Measure the height of the lenses as well as the width, then measure the temple (arms) and you may want to measure the bridge (nose area) and last but not least measure across the face of your glasses from the outside left to the outside right. With these numbers in front of you now go to any of the on line retailers out there. I highly prefer Zenni (zennioptical.com) but that is up to you. Now when you find glasses you like click on them and it should show you all the dementions that you have in front of you. Match up as close as you like to your current glasses and they should fit you very well. Some including Zenni even allow you to post your picture and try on glasses that way.  </p><p>As for the lenses you will select single vision, and your prescription is not anywhere close to needing hi index lenses so go with their standard lens options, for Zenni you would want the 1.57 option which there is no additional charge for. They have  1.50 lens as well but it is really for someone with say a -.50 rx and they choose a drill mount frame, that is a little thicker lens so it won't be so easy to break. Also choose an AR coating that you want. Zenni now offers 3 options and to be honest i have always only went with the least expensive one which is $4.95 but they have one for $9.95 and now $14.95 which are supposed to be even better with keeping smudges and fingerprints off your lenses. </p><p>Many on liners have return policies, Zenni does as well and they will refund 50% of the what the glasses cost with no questions asked so if you get your glasses and they are not the color brown you wanted you can return them.  </p><p>I hope this covers many of your questions about getting your glasses on line if not ask and i will do my best to help. </p><p>   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Philip</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2013, 08:46</p><p>Happy New Year Clare. Are you still wearing glasses or have you reverted to the dreaded contacts? Will 2013 be the year of the add for you?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2013, 03:38</p><p>My first post this year, so happy new year to everyone. </p><p>I've never bought online but would consider it. What I wonder is how you get them properly fit and what happens if they get loose?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2013, 12:51</p><p>There is a company called selectspecs.com in the UK who offer complete glasses for £6.00 </p><p> </p><p>They are based in Westgate on Sea, Kent and have previously only sold on-line, but now they have opened a shop and I think also do eye tests. </p><p> </p><p>Their £6.00 glasses are in a range of styles from +6 to -6 and cyl. +2 to -2 and also include anti-glare, UV protection, and scratch resistance - they also do re-glazing from £35.00 and I think they can do prism correction too. </p><p> </p><p>My wife works just around the corner from them, and may have had her sneaky eye test (see post on other Thread) there, as re-glazing even for varifocals and rimless is quite cheap. </p><p> </p><p>Any reports on just how good they are welcomed as they must be the cheapest around. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2013, 10:53</p><p>Specs4Ne </p><p> </p><p>Well then you had no other option but to return them. I can't understand why they had the bifocal so high up on the lenses. It almost seems a mistake was made. </p><p>Generally speaking with adjustable nose pads you can alter the bifocal by about 4 or 5 millimeters. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2013, 00:06</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p>They do have an adjustable nose pad setup; however, I could not get them low enough.  The beginning of the add was still directly in my normal line of sight and there by making everything at any distance very blurry.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2013, 14:46</p><p>Specs4Me </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps I've been lucky but I've not had any bother with varifocals.  I have never tried bifocals. I went straight to varifocals when I could no longer watch TV and read the newspaper at the same time.  Not because of vanity (at least I don't think so), but because it seemed a technically better solution.  It took me about three weeks to get used to them and I've no complaints.  I have heard it said that it is harder to convert from bifocals to varifocals. </p><p>I do notice that in my backup pair, which I bought online, the add seems to begin higher up the lens than in those bought from opticians shops.  This is fine for outdoor, but noticeable when reading, but still tolerable.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2013, 10:02</p><p>Spex4Me </p><p> </p><p>If you do try again to get progressives i suggest getting something with adjustable nose pads so that they can be fitted if they need to be. A plastic frame of course doesn't allow for any adjusting up and down your nose or at least very little. </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2013, 09:04</p><p>Lentifan, </p><p>Therein lies the problem, I had to bend my head forward and look out of the top of the lens to have any chance of seeing clearly, add to that the fact that the PD was off mm or so it was almost impossible to see anything without contorting my head. </p><p> </p><p>I've recieved the replacement glasse and I'm happy with them.  They are made with a lined bifocal which I'm OK with.  At my age we are expected to wear bifocals anyway so life goes on. </p><p> </p><p>I'll probably order a clear pair from them, the price certainly is attractive to an old retired guy.....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Trent</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2013, 21:00</p><p>Anyone heard of this dispenser? </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.warbyparker.com/" target="_blank">http://www.warbyparker.com/</a> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2013, 12:46</p><p>I'm not an expert either but I can understand why the progressive add portion of the lens starts higher than a lined bifocal.  The latter, by definition, is a lens with two discrete focal lengths, or powers, whereas the progressive lens, again by definition, includes a GRADUAL progression between the two focal lengths.  Therefore, there is a point in the lens where the distance power BEGINS to change towards the reading power. </p><p>One would expect this to be higher in the lens than the 'line' in a bifocal lens, just as the upper line in a tri-focal lens would be higher than the line in a bifocal. </p><p>Having said that, I am still a little surprised that the progressive area starts aove the mid-point of the lens, as you might expect to look straight ahead through the distance Rx.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2013, 12:05</p><p>Specs4Me </p><p>I don't that I consider myself an expert on how Zenni operates, but you are correct about how they place the the add in their glasses. I talked to one of their reps and they told me the same thing as you found out. I even asked if that didn't lead to a lot of returns if the add was not in a comfortable position for the wearer? They said that the percent of returns is really very small and since they have a refund policy of 50% back without any questions it seems to work out. Without going into their lab I can't answer why the adds MUST be in a certain spot for progressives and a different position for lined bifocals.  </p><p>To be honest I tell anyone that has ordered bifocals through me that there is a possibility that the add may be off and that they may not work for them. I also try to encourage that they choose a frame that has adjustable nose pads as that really helps so the glasses can be adjusted that way slightly. To date i have not had anyone that has had a problem with their bifocals or progressives.  </p><p>Most when I tell them the slight risk because they aren't paying much for their glasses anyway are willing to try it instead of paying hundreds at an optical shop. Remember many that I deal with don't have any insurance. </p><p>Again we all know there is no such thing as perfection in any business and I can understand not everyone likes Zenni and there are certainly many options out there.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2013, 00:12</p><p>S4Me, </p><p>That is why I stopped ordering from Zenni. I wanted to specify the fitting height of the progressive, and they refused. It seems like it would be no big deal to pass the info on to the lab with the rx. But what do I know? </p><p>Nevertheless, they are off my list. I have been buying frames off of eBay and sending them to JEM. JEM doesn't have much in the way of frames, but their lab is top notch and reasonable.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;05 Jan 2013, 18:47</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p>Since you're the expert on Zenni, I have an observation and a question for you. </p><p> </p><p>I ordered a pair of sunglasses from them, wanted progressives.  When I got them I noticed that they put the progressive start point way too high and that the PD seemed to be off.  I had the PD checked by my ECP's optom and she confirmed that it was off. </p><p> </p><p>I contacted Zenni and was told that they only put the progressive in one spot and could not change it.  I don't remember exactly where they put it but I think it ended up being 2mm above the physical center of the lens.  They said to send the glasses back and they would check them and if in fact the PD was off they would remake.  I asked if they would remake in a lined bifocal which they said that they would, they told me that the lined bifocal was placed 2mm below the physical center of the lens so I figured that would work.  I send the glasses back and they confirmed that they needed to be re-made and would do so in a lined bifocal.  Just recieved the re-made glasses today, have not had a chance to test them fully but they seem to be OK. </p><p> </p><p>My question is: Have you had any problems like this and if so how do you handle?  I'm surprised that they are so fixed on the hieght of the progressive, other than selecting a frame with a very large frame hieght how can this be addressed? </p><p> </p><p>Thanks, </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Trent</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2012, 21:09</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p> </p><p>That's a solid recommendation for Zenni.  And yes they did respond saying all their progressive lenses are made from a polycarbonate composite polymer. Thanks again! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2012, 20:27</p><p>Trent </p><p>I must admit I have never questioned the material that they use for their lenses but for what it is worth I have ordered many hundreds of glasses from them over the past 10 years both for the vision volunteer group I am with as well as many others including many friends and even family members and everyone has been well pleased with their glasses. One young lady is an optician with Pearle Vision and has been there for 4 years now and she gets a free pair every year and she of course always gets the name brand designer glasses to wear in the store with the best lenses they sell. She told me more than once that she actually prefers her cheap glasses that she gets several times a year from Zenni as they are more comfortable to wear. She has never complained about the lenses. I will ask her when I see her again if she van tell any difference between the expensive ones she gets and the Zenni lenses? I really want to know myself now that you have brought it up. Great question. I hope Zenni responds to your question as well. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Trent</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2012, 20:10</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p> </p><p>Yes I am considering Zenni in fact I have already e-mailed them with a question about their lens material. Except for the 1.59 index which are pure polycarbonate all their lenses are made from a polycarbonate composite polymer. Polycarbonate does not have the clarity that other lens materials do nonetheless their prices are inviting. For a pair of 1.57 index, frame, coatings and shipping it comes to $57!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John S</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2012, 18:23</p><p>I and other friends have sent in a number of pairs, and also ordered complete pairs with SV &amp; progressive lenses from JEM Optical in Florida (CR-39). From what I can tell, the work is done in their local lab. The RX, PD, and FTH have been perfect. The progressives supplied have been AO lenses (obviously I cannot tell about the SV lenses). Zenni will not allow you to specify the fitting height. Between not being able to send your own frame, and not having a say on the fitting height, I have decided to use JEM in the future. </p><p>I did not want to post a review until I had seen enough pairs to get a good track record (over 15). Except for incorrect base lenses being installed into a high wrap sunglass frame, I have been very happy. They frequently offer a ~30% discount. For lens replacement, they are very competitive. They have a limited selection of frames, they most seem to be no names. The AR coating is higher than Zenni and others, but it seems to be of higher quality. They only offer 3 types of lens materials, but I like CR-39, that is fine by me. </p><p>If anyone else has used them, I would like to hear your opinion. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

If you pretend to be ordering glasses where it has you select your lens type they offer both 1.50 and 1.56 at no additional cost. The only thing is if you pick the 1.50 lens option it only goes up to around -8.00 whereas the 1.56 goes up to -20.00.  </p><p>The reason they offer the thicker lens I am sure is mainly for someone with a very weak prescription and they order rimless glasses a 1.56 lens is almost too thin and break much easier.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LUVS THICK LENS</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2012, 10:12</p><p>Curious as to which online retailers offer a traditional CR-39 lens option.  I've always ordered through Zenni and the lowest is a 1.56 lens...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Sep 2012, 19:34</p><p>aviator-00- </p><p>So if I may ask then, are you purchasing women's glasses or men's glasses or maybe unisex glasses? So are you female as well? </p><p>Nothing wrong with your hobby if you don't mind me calling it that. I see nothing wrong with having a collection of different glasses and I think having women try them on sounds interesting and fun for you and them. </p><p>I also have about 50 different pairs of glasses in my samples that have for the most part either -.50 or -.75 lenses in them. The main reason for the samples is they come in handy working with the volunteer vision group I am with. But I also sue them with others as well. much like you do only I don't take any pictures. But actually maybe I should start doing that as well. I don't think the ladies would object. In fact I just met with a young lady this morning as she wanted to try on some glasses so she can order a pair. I was a bit surprised that she may be the first one that didn't find something to her liking in my samples. She thought the glasses loked nice and she liked the quality but she is interested in something on the big side and in bright colors. </p><p></p><hr>

If someone wears glasses full time wouldn't it make it more fun to be able to change into a different pair of glasses to match the outfit they are wearing?  </p><p>I have told this before but it fits this discussion well. A good friend to me is a manager of a local jewelery store. She always wore contacts, but in the spring months she suffered from allergies and said her eyes were killing her. I questioned her as to why she didn't wear her glasses? She said they were old and not really close to her current prescription anymore. After suggesting that she should order some glasses on line. Finally I was shocked to see her at work and wearing glasses. But more surprising was during our chatting she told me she ordered 8 pairs. She told me she kept finding different ones that she thought would go well with certain outfits and after totaling the cost of all was only $125.00 much less than she paid for her last glasses. I saw her recently and she told me her prescription had changed a bit and she again ordered 8 more pairs and was about to get 4 more as well. By the way of course she doesn't bother with contacts anymore. </p><p></p><hr>

The side edges of both lenses have a bit of a 'myodisc effect' which might be due to being the maximum thickness lens blanks they have in stock. Still, 15 millimeter-thick lenses are very nice. Needless to say, lens thickness depends on the size of the frames.  </p><p> </p><p>As far as I can see they don't offer special requests. But when I order from them, I say something like this in the customer comments field: 'I realise the lenses will be very thick. Please use the thickest lenses available'.

The lenses are the biggest part of the expense so I can understand them doing it with plano but I can say that whoever DOES do that in North America would probably monopolize my business. </p><p> </p><p>I dont even bother with bricks and mortar stores anymore, most of the time you don't really have the freedom to try plus I would never foot the "High Street" prices as you guys put it anyway so my trying them on in store is just to get a sense of the types of frames that might work and a waste of their time in actually trying to sell me something lol</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2012, 04:44</p><p>GlassesDirect will send you four frames at a time to try out, as many times as necessary, for one payment of £5, which is deducted from the bill when you finally buy - and you get a second pair free. They are OK, but their progressives are not as good quality as more expensive ones.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2012, 03:28</p><p>Nicky - I too have been offered many free trials with GlassesDirect, but they only offer the glasses with plano lenses for free. Their thinking is that they send you (I think) 5 pairs free of charge, you pick the one(s) you like and you send them back to have prescription lenses put in them. Once I learnt that they send the glasses in this form I was no longer interested in this concept, but it's another clever marketing gimmick, but not the most exciting deal in the world then for us who can't stand plano's!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DWV</b>&nbsp;25 Apr 2012, 03:13</p><p>I came across a forum that was discussing Shuron frames.  Some people were of the opinion that the current Shuron frames are not the same quality as in the past.  I recently got a pair from FramesRX (best price I could find online for new Shuron).  Quality seemed fine, but these were plastic frames, not a combination metal style. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>EyeTri</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2012, 03:14</p><p>I think both Shuron and Art-Craft still make frames in the USA.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2012, 13:01</p><p>If so, my frame labelled "made in USA" are likely to be false claim. It is likely to be manufactured in China. </p><p> </p><p>Now we have discovered this. Does not really worth going to Osaka, Japan. to purchase such frame. It cost around US $ 40 in Osaka.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2012, 11:08</p><p>Astra </p><p>From the best that I can tell there are no eyeglass frame manufacturers in the US. They of course do have lens manufacturers though. Actually most frames except a few come from China. There are some from Italy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2012, 23:20</p><p>Are there any lenses or frames manufactures in US ? How are the price ?  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2012, 17:22</p><p>Lazysiow </p><p>Oh! Your thought is totally possible and I am sure that someone is in fact doing just what you suggest. I have a very good friend that is an optical manager at a Sam's Warehouse store nearby. I had told her many times about Zenni and she finally decided to order glasses for herself from them. For her it was a very good deal because her company does not offer her free pair each year as many optical stores do. So if she wanted or needed new glasses she would only get a 10% discount on them. She got 3 pairs of glasses her rx and was thrilled at how fast they arrived, the price and the quality. Now every time I see her she is trying to convince me into going into business with her selling Zenni glasses. It would be easy to do, now Zenni even sells their frames with demo lenses in them for under $5.00. Some are as low as $3.00. like she said, you rent a space and have a laptop handy. You bring in a good sampling of styles to display and sell them for triple the price you pay Zenni for them. You go into the Zenni website and place the customer's orders at the the end of each day. She even said she was quite sure her doctor would take an active role as well because she is also new and looking to increase her patient list.          </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2012, 00:30</p><p>Ok I've had this idea for awhile but what if there were stores JUST for trying out the frames you can buy at online retailers. Instead of Ray-Ban, Fendi etc the shelves would be marked Clearly Contacts, EyeBuy Direct etc. It could be an independent business set up where somebody just buys up a set of every frame and color offered and just stuffs them in a store and maybe charges an entry or per hour fee. Or the online retailers could form a collective and form a chain. </p><p> </p><p>The idea for this game about because I have a ton of frames and old prescriptions now. There are many that didn't fit or were just not comfortable to wear all day but given the cost and delay in returns etc I kept them around just to have some spares. I'm sure if I added up the cost of having so many it would not be too dissimilar from getting the one pair that you know is likeable from having tried it at the store. In the end I end up sticking to one or two anyway.  </p><p> </p><p>I've already got too much on my plate to start something like this myself (silent investor a possibility)but hell I would just love to be able to use such a store. Thoughts everyone?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2012, 19:58</p><p>Pete:  They don't require an rx.  I just sent them an email with my prescription and the PD.  That's all they wanted ( and a Paypal payment naturally).  I'm sure they do glasses with "no questions asked".  I think the anti-glare coating is included.  I know they polish the edges for free.  Contact Ms. Wu for any info you may require.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2012, 17:29</p><p>Stingray </p><p>Looks like a nice find. I don't know anything about the company, but her prices seem more than fair. I found a nice semi-rimless frame for $9.00 and single vision lenses (1.56) for $7.00. The only thing I couldn't find was an option for AR coating. They must offer it? I may have to test them at some point. much like Zenni and others they don't require a doctors rx.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2012, 16:31</p><p>I would like to recommend <a href="http://www.5starglasses.com/" target="_blank">http://www.5starglasses.com</a>  as an online retailer.  I ordered 2 pairs of eyeglasses from them; one for me and one for my wife.  We both got prescription progressive lenses with photo-chromic (changes to sunglasses in the sun) and a semi rimless frame.  The frame was $13 and the lenses $90.  They paid for shipping and included an eyeglass case, microfiber cloth and a screwdriver for fixing loose screws.  I suggest you contact Monica Wu who speaks and writes English and she can help you out.  You can't beat the prices and the service.  Turn-around time from order to delivery in the the U.S. from China was 2 1/2 weeks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2012, 12:29</p><p>yes, take them to any optical store. </p><p> </p><p>this is the most basic service they provide, even if they can't offer good frames or lenses, they at least have proper tools to fix faulty frames. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2012, 11:47</p><p>JC </p><p>The simple answer is, don't try to adjust them yourself. The best thing to do is to take them to any optical store and they will be happy to adjust them for you at no charge. They don't mind as they hope you may come back the next time you need eyewear and purchase from them. I have adjusted hundreds of glasses that didn't come from our shop.  </p><p>When you are doing it yourself you run the risk of breaking them. They have the proper tools to do the adjustment needed. Even Believe it or not but many stores if for some reason thye accidently break your glasses will actually replace them at no charge. Now to be honest where I worked we didn't do that but we did generally sell them a new pair for about half price.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JC</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2012, 11:14</p><p>A post in the sightings thread about misfit glasses that no decent optician would dispense made me think about buying online, which is how I buy all of my glasses.  I have fit them to myself the best I can by tweaking the nose pads and slightly bending the temple arms, but of course since in reality I don't really know what I'm doing I always feel like I could get a little better result.  Has anyone ever seen a step by step guide of how to properly adjust a frame to a face?  In particular I always find one lens sits higher then the other because one of my ears is slightly higher then the other; I try to correct this by bending one arm downwards a bit.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Oct 2011, 10:39</p><p>Dee </p><p>I just checked out that site and it's okay. It's never a bad thing to find new places to shop on-line. Most all of the on-line retailers charge a little extra for higher rx's and  if you have much cyl to deal with. I did a quick cost comparison of the add on's and Zenni is cheaper in all areas. Zenni is $4.95 for AR coating compared to $9.95, all the lens options are cheaper at Zenni as well. For instance 1.61 hi index lenses are $19.00 at Zenni compared to $31.99 and the 1.67 hi index lenses at Zenni are $34.00 compared to $79.99. </p><p>But you may like the selection better than then what Zenni offers or you may have had a bad experience with Zenni. I must admit that I have tried to find other on-line retailers that equals the quality and prices and so far have found no one. The old LB Eyewear was very close,but they would charge you a delivery charge for each pair of glasses you ordered at the same time of $5.00 each. Zenni only charges a one time delivery of $5.00 for 1 pair or 100 pairs. </p><p>And before you ask, no I don't have any stock in Zenni nor do I collect a commission, but I sure wish I did.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Oct 2011, 13:32</p><p>You can look into Warby Parker on You Tube and there are a few people that have gotten their glasses from there. They seem well pleased. One interesting thing is that they will donate a free pair of glasses for everyone sold to people that can't afford them. Avery nice thing. But looking at their site they don't seem to have a big variety to choose from. Pricing is easy. $95.00 for your choice and that includes the lenses with AR coating and scratch resistant coatings.  </p><p>Personally I still feel like zennioptical.com offers many more and for a good deal less. There are a few places like globaleyeglases.com and coastal eywear.com that offer designer glasses for about the same price as the Warbly Parker glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;14 Jul 2011, 13:14</p><p>Finally ordered from Choice Eyewear, a pair of +20D lentics with an add of +5. Two days later I got a call from them saying that they cannot make that Rx in a bifocal, but were happy to provide me with two pairs in each of the Rx's. It seems that they use labs in China, probably the same labs that SGS uses, and that they never checked about the availability of such high scripts. I had my doubts when I saw that they offered a +25D bifocal, as to my knowledge no one made a blank higher than +20D in a bifocal. </p><p> </p><p>Still, this notwithstanding, they were very friendly and cheap, and I have two pairs on the way from them. We'll see how they turn out when I get them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2011, 14:57</p><p>NJ </p><p>Remember I am guessing that they only changed there name. My orders were placed with "LBWeyewear".

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2011, 12:19</p><p>Hey soundmanpt, I haven't yet ordered from Choice Eyewear, but plan to, so glad to hear they have good quality as well as good prices. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2011, 12:58</p><p>NJ </p><p>I have ordered from LBW before they changed there name and as you say they offer good quality and good service. The only reason I didn't use them more is because they feel the need to charge for delivery for each pair of glasses ordered even at the same time. So in my case I most often am ordering anywhere from 6 - 14 pairs at one time. Zenni only charges a one time shipping cost of $5.00 no matter how many. With the old LBW it could cost as much as $70.00 in shipping. I didn't feel that was right. However for most people that are only getting one pair of course that is fine. </p><p>Your comments about the care that Zenni takes is something I have noticed more than once. As I have told others you can like them or hate them but they do care to try and make glasses that will be right. I know people seem to get put off by this , but they are only showing they care.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2011, 11:37</p><p>Choice Eyewear does look like a great alternative. It's the first site that openly offers very high plus scripts. I have managed to get my +20s as special orders from other places, mostly Eyeglasses International in Florida, but Choice Eyewear is the very fist online site to have pull-down scripts anywhere near this high. And they are cheap! </p><p> </p><p>Also, in support of Zenni, I ordered two pairs from them in my low script (+1 sph, -1 cyl range with adds), one for regular use and one for computer use. Zenni noticed a discrepancy between the two Rx's in that one specified a -0.75 cyl and the other a -1.00 cyl. They emailed me to ask about it, and suggested I call my eyedoc to confirm. For what looks like a cheap, high volume operation, I was very impressed with their attention to detail! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Highmyope</b>&nbsp;22 May 2011, 00:54</p><p>Possibly of interest: LBW has renamed itself "Choice Eyewear" and now offers powers from -25 to +25. Prices look the same.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;11 May 2011, 21:27</p><p>Actually Soundmanpt, it was over 4 weeks from when the order was placed until I received my order. And then the most important pair of glasses was improperly made. The left lens had a bubble in it - you know the type of distortion you get when they grind the center too thin, and then put the lens in the frame.  So I called aqnd complained and got a RMA and I had to send them back. I paid extra, and sent them priority post, with delivery guaranrteed Monday, and I still havent't heard from Zenni that they have received and inspected the glasses. </p><p>They have 2 weeks yeaterday to get them fixed and get them to me, or they can cancell the order.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 May 2011, 18:24</p><p>specs4ever </p><p>Can you look back at the exact date you placed your order? has it really been more than 3 weeks?

If I have a reason to call I will ask for you because I would be curious to know as well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 17:12</p><p>Oh dear, I hope my order from Zenni doesn't take forever to arrive here to UK. I ordered from them once before about a year ago and it took exactly 3 weeks. Also agree that new website has pros and cons, the annoying thing I find is that colour options of the same frame are no longer listed under the one frame.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 11:45</p><p>Also I think that the lens issue is due more to the fact that they deal more to the masses. Most people want their lenses thin, thinner the better. We are a different group of people that come here each day and sorry to say a very small minority. I think they are only trying to cut down on remake orders where people don't realize that the lenses they have picked will be very thick. Because they offer a 50% refund policy that causes remakes to be expensive.  </p><p>I have had several times that they called me about the PD only checking to be sure it wasn't a mistake. The most recent was glasses I ordered for an optician friend from Wal-Marts her PD is only 53 and they thought that was too small. The girl is 25 and her eye are very close together. She had a hard time finding glasses that would even work. In fact she couldn't find anything in her store that worked for her. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 11:30</p><p>specs4ever - You have many valid points, actually I do agree that I liked there old format better than this new one and it took me a while to learn my way around it. I found it does help to narrow it down by using the sidebar on the left side where you can indicate the price range, single vision vs. bifocals, shape of frame, color etc. But I do like the idea that they offer so many to choose from now over 6000. I like that one can post their own picture to use for look. Honestly i have always found there customer service people to be very good and helpful. But that being said the strongest glasses I have ever purchased from them were in the -12.00 range without a problem. The only reason I can give for your waiting 4 weeks is that they may have gotten pulled in customs coming from China. This has happened to me twice out of many many orders I have placed with them. In both cases they ended up replacing the orginal order at no cost and at some point you would get the orginal order plus the replacement. so you got a duplicate order for the price of one. Of course it is your choice to use any on-line retailer you wish and i'm sure they are very good, the only thing I have found is that most of them are a bit more pricey for options like AR coating etc.And in some cases shipping is more as well. But remember you as you said you have used them in the past without a problem, know one is perfect.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 10:37</p><p>specs4ever - I agree about their website, their latest redesign of it makes it extremely slow to navigate and given the large amount of frames that they have on offer I like to reduce it down to what I'm after at that specific time, but everytime I select one of their boxes it takes an age to reload the site. </p><p> </p><p>I also agree on the thick lenses point, I have previously posted my own problems with them over this. They even seem pernickety over the pd measurements saying some frames won't cos of it, which I'd never had from an optician before!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 09:18</p><p>Soundmanpt has been pounding the drums so heartily for Zenni, that I just have to post my experiences with them. At this point I have done at least one order every year from them, and up until this year my experiences have been fairly good.  But this past experience has left a very bad taste in my mouth, and I doubt I will order from them again.  It is a possibility that my problems are a result of them being too popular, and having their business expand beyond their capabilities. However, their customer service is also lacking. </p><p>1) Web site is very hard to navigate. Too slow, and poorly designed for the traffic they are getting. </p><p>2) Even when they are informed that "I know this is a strong prescription and the lenses will be thick in this frame they refuse to do what the customer wants. </p><p>3)Their delivery time is very slow. It has been 4 weeks since I placed my order and there has been so sign of my shipment.  </p><p>4)They have not even given me any indication that my glasses are finished and have been shipped unlike O4Less who advised me 2 weeks ago that my order was complete and my order had been shipped. Both orders were placed the same day. </p><p>Now I realize that my order might just be the exception to the rule, but I can't stand by and not let others know that in my mind Zenni isn't the greatest place to order from in the world.  This is my experience, so take it for what it is worth.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;04 May 2011, 17:08</p><p>Hey GWGS....Thanks - I keep thinking i'm the only young woman who actually WANTS to wear glasses. It's nice to know some people think that is somewhat amazing ;-) I'd like to post more about my fetish but will move to the 'Love of the lens' thread in case I get accused of cluttering up this one......</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;04 May 2011, 10:39</p><p>Wow, you sound amazing Rachel! </p><p> </p><p>I'd love to hear how you get on with your minus 5.5's!! I'm also a UK citizen and like you, although I don't need glasses have ordered a whole variety of frames and prescriptions as they're fairly cheap and can usually be resold if I, or my partner at the time, don't like them. </p><p> </p><p>GOC is another fun activity, but the couple of times I've tried it I've had trouble getting the contacts out of my eyes and this has put me off as I've had a high plus prescription in one eye, and bare eyed in the other and it's sometimes taken a few minutes to get the lens out. Aside from that its been great fun and would love to try it again. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;04 May 2011, 10:13</p><p>Hey Soundman </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for the info, really good to know. I have just placed my order. I'm a wannabe myope - in fact i'm slightly farsighted (+1) with a little astigmatism in both eyes. I'm 29 and have brown eyes, copper coloured hair and pale skin so i'd never get away with the black, hence going for the brown. I normally get brown specs and they look good. So i've actually ordered some in my current Rx and some -1.5 with the correct CYL correction as i'd like to see if I can get away with wearing them and still function. My husband's Rx is -2.5 and this is too much for me - I sometimes check when he's in the shower. I can kind of see ok but feel funny walking about. I also splashed out and got some -5.5's!!! Just for the hell of it, as i've never had chance to handle higher Rx minus glasses, and they're cheap enough. I opted for the 1.5 lenses hoping they'll look nice and thick. I'd love to do GOC in private but haven't been able to get a contacts fitting since my optician says I can't have them with my low current Rx. I've not been brave enough to lie and say I want coloured contacts...... anyone else in the UK done this? Plus there's the fact that my husband doesn't know i'm somewhat obsessed! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;04 May 2011, 08:52</p><p>Rachael - That is probably the most popular glasses that I sell the most of. They are well made and I have not had any complaints about them and many of the young ladies wear them full time. They are in no way cheap looking. My favorite as for color is the all black. That being said the brown is nice as well as the blk and red. The all red is okay if you like red, it is actually a scarlett color. Not sure what your rx is but it is great for people with rather high rxs. I have used that for people with rx's in the -5.50 area and not used high index lenses. With AR coating they will only cost you $15.00 plus shipping. In the USA it is $5.00 in the UK it is $9.00.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>EyeTri</b>&nbsp;04 May 2011, 04:11</p><p>Rachel, </p><p>Take a look at LensesRX.com and their Vicky frame. It looks about the same as that frame from Zenni,and is available in three colors. I have this frame in both brown and black, and I think the quality is good. They are slightly more expensive than the Zenni 339115,but still pretty resonable. These people are good to do business with, and they deliver quickly.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;03 May 2011, 16:55</p><p>Soundmanpt: </p><p>I noticed you commented on zenni frame 339115. I am thinking of placing an order for these in brown soon and wondered if you could vouch for the quality/appearance of the plastic with these frames. I ordered some plastic frames from zenni last year and was disappointed with the finish, they looked like cheap OTC specs..... </p><p>BTW, I have been observing threads for ages but not posted until now in case anyone is wondering who I am! </p><p>Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;01 May 2011, 01:31</p><p>chrissi@ </p><p> </p><p>The Zenni glasses equipped with 1.57 lenses near your own Rx can be seen at <a href="http://ladiesbehindcrystalveil.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://ladiesbehindcrystalveil.blogspot.com/</a> (Petra 280-299, including some side views of the lenses) and at <a href="http://moreladiesbehindcrystalveil.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://moreladiesbehindcrystalveil.blogspot.com/</a> (Karen 270-271 and 277-280; Jolien 204-222).

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2011, 19:20</p><p>Chrissi - The 1.57 lenses are the same as CR-39 lenses. The 1.50 lenses are even thicker that is why they only go to -8.00. If you get your glasses made using the 1.57 lenses they will be very thick. </p><p>Maybe have a look at the latest photo shoot that "Crystal Veil" put up a few weeks ago with the pretty blond girl. If you view all the pictures you will find several glasses from Zenni using the 1.57 lenses with -12.00 lenses. I think there may even be a few with -13.00 as well. The only problem is the frames are not real big, but it may give an idea of the thickness you would have. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2011, 16:15</p><p>Chrissi - thick minus lenses and big plastic frames are the hottest combination of all :) Pete</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2011, 16:08</p><p>Hi Soundmanpt and Pete. Sorry, I meant to say that Zenni won't accommodate my rx in the lowest index in the big frames. Sorry for not clarifying. Thanks for your help!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2011, 15:54</p><p>Chrissi - I am not sure what you mean that Zenni won't accommodate your prescription? I just went into their web site and using glasses #820415 which is a big frame, actually is is a knock off of the famous Ray-Ban Wayfarer style. I even made the prescription for -13.50 in each eye and I used the standard 1.57 lenses and it accepted it without any question. The only addition was a $9.00 charge for being a strong rx. But even with that and the AR coating the total cost was only $23.95 Plus $5.00 for shipping. </p><p>Don't use the first option for lenses, it is for people with a really weak rx in a drill mount frame. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2011, 15:50</p><p>Thick minus lenses are VERY HOT, Chrissi :) Pete</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2011, 14:27</p><p>Hi everyone, thanks for all the input. I don't have my rx memorized or with me at the moment, so it's not exact, but I'm around -13 or almost -14 in my right eye and -12ish -13ish in my left. Soundmanpt, you are right. I was looking into getting slightly larger frames, but I now realize that Zenni won't accommodate my rx in the larger frames, which is too bad. I have a pair from Zenni that I ordered a while back in Feb with my current rx in them. I chose the 1.67 lens option, but the lenses are still pretty thick, about a centimeter. Oh well. Anyway. I was just interested in looking at some frames and what not. I might get another pair in late summer when I get a new rx.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glasses Lover</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2011, 05:11</p><p>@glasseslover - no sweat. All is cool. </p><p> </p><p>Oh, and I will say again that glassesshop.com is still a great site to order thick glasses without any crap. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2011, 11:48</p><p>glasseslover </p><p>I hope you enjoy your new glasses when they arrive. If I may make a suggestion, something I always tell my friends that go on-line. Find a pair of glasses that fit you well and using a ruler in millimeters measure them across the face part from outside left to outside right. If you come up with say 130 then check the frame you are considering from zenni and see how close that is to their frame in the "overall width" size. If it is only a millimeter off either way they should fit perfect. Also some seem to miss the box for AR coating (anti-reflective) it is only a $4.95 option ans I recommend it as it is great for driving at night and does cut down on glare. Are you going for the record a friend of mine has? She shocked me when I saw her wearing new glasses, first off because she was always a contact lens girl. But I was quite surprised when she said she ordered 8 pairs because she couldn't decide. Now she only wears glasses, sometimes several pairs in the same day. I am guessing your a female? Sounds like you plan on creating a nice glasses wardrobe? Good for you. You have different purses and different shoes why not different glasses? </p><p>Hope I helped,  </p><p>By the way I have ordered more than 400 pairs of glasses for people (non-profit vision group) and for friends in the last 8 years from zenni. One that is a real favorite is frame #339115. It comes in all blk, all brn, blk and red and red.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2011, 11:29</p><p>Chrissi </p><p>I have your answer. No they do up to -20.00 in 1.57 lens material at no additional cost except for a stronger rx. What you picked was the 1.50 lenses which are a thicker lens material mainly used for very low rxs with rimless frames to make the lenses thicker and so they wont break easily. The 1.50 lenses only go up to -8.00 because they would be very thick. (But nice for someone doing GOC) Again try again only be sure to click on the 1.57 lenses. What rx was you whating to order if I may ask?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2011, 11:08</p><p>Fabienne </p><p>The rimless and semi-rimless comes with polished edges. I don't know if you can request that they not polish them or not. If you have much trouble deciding do as many of my friends do when they can't decide they order more than one. Makes it even more fun wearing glasses when you have more than one to choose from to wear. My record is a friend of mine actually ordered 8 pairs at one time because she couldn't decide which ones she could live without. Her total cost was around $125.00. </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

What I could not unambigously see from the pictures is, whether they polish the edges? Or can I choose between polished and frozen? </p><p> </p><p>Thanks again for your answers.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2011, 18:37</p><p>Dave </p><p>I agree the cases they use are not much to brag about, but your not wearing the case. haha! I usually suggest to people that might only be wearing their glasses part time that they may want to purchase a better case. Look at this way you, saved more than $200.00 at Zenni that should buy a pretty nice case.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2011, 15:02</p><p>@CJ </p><p> </p><p>I think the old glasses were about $300.  They were from Wal-Mart.  Frames were about $100 and the lenses $200.  They're single vision and I forgot to ask for the AR.  Too many reflections off the inside surface. </p><p> </p><p>The new glasses are $113 including shipping. </p><p> </p><p>@soundmanpt </p><p> </p><p>I never got any sort of wrench.  Hope I never need one.  They came in the cheapest case I've ever seen.  I think it was designed to cross the pacific ocean just once LOL.  (Shipping was from hong kong)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2011, 01:12</p><p>Dave, </p><p>The pictures are excellent and very helpful in understanding the problem. The glasses are very nice looking.  I am not familiar with those type frames, but it looks like they have used a cap nut as a locking (jamb) nut to keep the main nut from loosening, so you may not have much need of tiny tools to keep them tight.  I suspect the trick would be to snug the main (inner nut) just enough to keep from damaging the lens and then torque the cap nut enough to lock it with out stripping anything or stretching the screw.  I suspect the torques involved are in gram-mm. </p><p>Could you give us an idea to the difference in cost between the older glasses and the Zenni's. </p><p>C.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2011, 23:20</p><p>Dave </p><p>They did send along the tool to tighten the nuts didn't they? They normally do. Be sure to keep this tool in a safe place. Not just zenni but as you probably know that style of frame tends to ned more care than say a plastic frame. As a rule of thumb I would be sure to check all nuts to be sure they stay tight. </p><p>Nice glasses! I think zenni is one of the best if not the best on-line retailers out there.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2011, 21:23</p><p>I just got my new Zenni glasses today.  They cost $113.85 CAD including the $9.95 flat rate shipping.  The specifications are here: <a href="http://www3.telus.net/daves/New_Glasses/Specs.JPG" target="_blank">http://www3.telus.net/daves/New_Glasses/Specs.JPG</a>  They arrived in 12 days. </p><p> </p><p>I liked them so much I ordered the same pair today in a non-photochromatic progressive with +1.75 add.  They will cost $66.80 including shipping. </p><p> </p><p>I uploaded a few pictures: <a href="http://www3.telus.net/daves/New_Glasses/" target="_blank">http://www3.telus.net/daves/New_Glasses/</a>  I hope all my links work. </p><p> </p><p>In picture 5 I placed them beside my old glasses which are the same Rx except both lenses are sph -0.50.  The old ones are Essilor transitions if I remember correctly.  You can see the new ones are thicker which is OK for my weak prescription.  You can also see the apparent "twist" in the lenses that are for astigmatism. </p><p> </p><p>The only thing I don't like is how much the screw sticks out the back.  I have never seen anything like that before.  However, I don't notice it in any way when I'm wearing the glasses and I doubt it will be noticeable to others. </p><p> </p><p>I only wear rimless, and probably always will.   I think these will be good glasses for me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2011, 04:55</p><p>Hi Fabienne, I hope that your new Zenni glasses will be a success. Let us know after a few weeks of use. Thank you for the nice compliment about my models. I am in the process of uploading an extensive photo shoot with a new model. She is in her mid thirties and she fits your description perfectly. I will post here on the "Seen on the web" thread as soon as the whole photo shoot is installed on my new weblog.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fabienne</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2011, 00:56</p><p>Thanks, Crystal Veil, so I will try it as you suggested. Incidentally, it was your ladies behind crystal veil blog which has drawn my attention to zennioptical.com. I know, it doesn't fit to this thread, but what I even liked more than the glasses is the fact that you work with models at very different ages, having a natural look, some even without any makeup or something like that; keep it up! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2011, 19:21</p><p>Fabienne@ </p><p> </p><p>you can write an additional instruction to Zenni, indicating that your PD is slightly asymmetrical and asking them to adjust the lenses to the position you need. I did this for some of my models who had a distinct PD asymmetry like your good self. They were all quite happy with the glasses, no headaches or problems whatsoever!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fabienne</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2011, 17:33</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>thanks for your reply. So, I think I will try the cheaper photochromatic lenses and not the transitions. I know, they are useless for driving, but they will be a useful addition to my (commpared to others here in ES) still small glasses collection, which already contains a pair of Rx sunglasses.  </p><p> </p><p>Fred, </p><p> </p><p>thanks for your reply, too. You are right, the transitions lenses are painfully expensive and the zenni price with VAT would still be unbeatable. By the way, my actual Rx sunglasses are from brille24.de, but unfortunately the tint (75 % brown) is clearly inhomogeneous and for that or for another reason they cause eyestrain. So I can use them for short periods of time only. Maybe brille24.de is o.k. for clear lenses but concerning the tinted ones they did not convince me. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Concerning a zenni order I have a further question. My PD values are asymmetric (31/33), the zenni website offers only the opportunity to fill in the sum of both (64). So, I guess, the lenses will be fitted symmetrically (32/32). Could this be a problem and cause eyestrain?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fred</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2011, 16:05</p><p>Hi Fabienne, </p><p> </p><p>I ordered multiple times from zenni and never had any issues with customs in Germany. Nevertheless there is always the risk of the import VAT (19% USt.) charge. Still the price of zenni of much better than with local dealers especially with the transition lenses. I always went for their basic 1.5. index offer and even with my -7 prescription I am happy with them. In case you want to go for tinted lenses only and your prescription is lower +/- 6 "www.brille24.de" might be another choice I made good experience with both quality and price (39 EUR) wise. Hope this helps.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2011, 10:55</p><p>Fabienne </p><p>I have not ordered either of the type of lenses from zenni that you ask about, however I am familiar with both types of lenses and they do about the same thing.The photochromatic lenses do have one thing that may bother you, they tend to stay a bit dark er than clear under flourscent lighting. But I will issue you a caution that many people don't know. Both are very good when going from indoors to outdoors, they do take a few minutes to change. The biggest problem is they are nearly useless for driving as sunglasses. They will only slightly change and not get very dark at all. Your windshield has UV in it and UV is what makes the lenses change. For someone that works outdoors are spends much time outdoors they are great. Sorry to say that for driving you would still need a pair of prescription sunglasses. Actually if it were me I would probably just buy 2 pairs of glasses from zenni. Regular glasses and rx sunglasses. It is actually about the same price doing that anyway. Of course the downside is you need to be switching glasses. hope that helps a bit.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fabienne</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2011, 01:12</p><p>Hi all, </p><p> </p><p>at present I'm thinking about ordering online at zennioptical.com and have some questions:  </p><p> </p><p>First, does anyone have experience with the photocromic lenses they offer (there is a big difference concerning the price between the 1.50 Transitions lenses and some other photochromic lenses (index 1.57))? Is it worth to take the expensive Transitions? </p><p> </p><p>Second, are there any experiences with shipping to germany concerning unexpected custums duty or something like that? </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for your comments. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2011, 11:26</p><p>Sorry, the previous post from "Dave" was actually from me for Dave.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2011, 11:26</p><p>I've worn progressives for twenty years, and I never had an adjustment problem at all.  I think people who have problems (and this is just my opinion) may be those who have higher prescriptions for distance than I have.  I started with a mild prescription for near-sightedness and now I have a mild prescription for far-sightedness (probably because of age.)  As for the lens shape on 39dollarglasses:  they may not offer choices other than the ones pictured with each frame.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2011, 17:10</p><p>@ Dave </p><p> </p><p>my "getting used to" with varifocals took less than a minute, in spite of two handicaps: four diopters difference between both eyes AND a first add of +2.00. No problem at all, I walked out of the shop and never had any problems. This was over 20 years ago. The only occasions when I use single vision glasses are when I am on really steep slopes heading down the valley after climbing mountains in Switzerland.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dave</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2011, 15:50</p><p>@Crystal Veil, russell </p><p> </p><p>How did you find the getting-used-to period for progressives? </p><p> </p><p>When I first tried them I said I can't wear these.  They lowered the seg to the bottom third of the lens I could tolerate them.

<p><b>russell</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2011, 09:26</p><p>Dave...I have bought progressive lenses many times from both Zenni and 39dollarglasses.com.  I have been totally pleased with all of them.  39dollarglasses.com also will do the narrow corridor lenses which means they can do narrower frames, which are more in fashion right now.  They used to charge extra for this, but now they don't.  You simply order the frame you want and they put the appropriate lenses in.  And you can send them your own frame for new lenses, too.  I highly recommend them!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2011, 03:18</p><p>Hi Dave, </p><p> </p><p>I ordered several varifocals from Zenni and they are entirely to my satisfaction. I wear them all day. The glasses cost me only â¬ 40, with anti-reflective coating. I have some 3,5 diopters difference between both eyes - but it works. I also ordered varifocals from Zenni for two of my models and the ladies wear them fulltime. It's a pity that Zenni does not manufacture varifocal lenses above minus 10.00. My partner has minus 12 and I am still looking for an online retailer for her precription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2011, 06:45</p><p>anic </p><p> </p><p>I understand your dilemma but likelenses may be quite right about the astigmatism. </p><p>Perhaps the "safest" way is to put off your glasses just before you reach the shop. You can tell them that you lost or broke your glasses. </p><p>If you select an optician that has a one hour service your story will be much more credible and there is a fair chance that no questions will be asked at all. </p><p>It's probably best to choose an optician in a different part of the city. </p><p>Another option - 100% sure no questions will be asked - is to order a cheap trial lens set on the internet and do the eye test yourself but that will cost you about 150 GBP.  </p><p>I have an antique trial lens set and I sometimes use it to check the Rx of models for my photo shoots if they don't know their prescription. When I notice that my own glasses are too strong or too weak I always use the trial lens set for a check and the results always match the outcome when I go to an optician.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>anic</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2011, 04:36</p><p>Can you tell me then like lenses how, if I'm not truly minus 7 with the applicable add prescription, I get away with wearing these glasses into the opticians? Someone said previously if I did want to go for an eye test there are ways around explaining how I have such a high prescription for someone who's never had an eye test before. </p><p> </p><p>I need some advice on what to say to the opticians when I go in for an eye test as they'll surely ask when my last eye test was etc and this could be a truly awkward position to be in!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Like lenses</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2011, 00:33</p><p>anic </p><p>  The reason that I think you should get an eye exam is that at your age with -7.00 glasses you should be able to read without a bifocal.  </p><p>  I therefore conclude that you have some astigmatism,and that is what is causing the reading problem. Wearing the bifocal will enlarge the image,but at the same time subjects your eyes to a less minus condition,which is not good for inducing additional minus. So if you have astigmatism,by getting an exam.,then you would know the proper amount of cylinder,and axis to incorporate into any stronger minus that you would want to try.There is another benefit,in that having a cylinder correction,adds to the lense thickness. </p><p>  You would progress much farther,and faster to your desired double digit prescription if you were able to subject your eyes to the close work wearing the strongest minus,that being the same as the one for distance.  </p><p>If I were you,I would not look at it as damage that you have done to your used to be normal perfect vision,but instead use it as a guage of progress toward your goal.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>anic</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2011, 03:36</p><p>Soundman - I am slightly apprehensive about posting in here, given Julian's previous comments about posting in the wrong thread, but here goes! </p><p> </p><p>I have said previously that I don't really want to know what actual rx I am. I started out with perfect vision - neither of my parents wore glasses until they were about 50ish when one wore glasses for reading so I know the history of my immediate family's eyesight is good - and therefore don't really want to be "confronted" by what "damage" I have done to my eyes! </p><p> </p><p>Friends and family don't know about me inducing myopia, I had posted on the inducing thread about my parents seeing me in glasses for the first time, and their comments - you may see that thread to refresh your memory of their comments as I only get to see them about once every year given they live in my home country of Poland. </p><p> </p><p>I am single at the moment, but had a boyfriend a couple of years ago who lived with me but he seemed none the wiser to my increasing prescriptions and apart from several discussions about how my eyes always seemed to be getting worse, and his concern for me over that, we never really talked about it that much. He liked me wearing glasses and would often pick the frames for me to wear, both current frames, and when I was looking for new ones to buy I would often ask his opinion. The relationship broke up probably because as I work nights, and he works during the day we never got to see much of each other. I've had several shorter term relationships since then, but none of them have ever questioned my glasses. One or two have wanted me to take my glasses off when we're in bed but I've relented saying I can't see much without them, and so I've always worn them until I go to sleep, apart from the odd occassion. I think I've posted before about the usual (or it seems over here in England it's usual for non glasses wearers to be intrigued about other peoples glasses) "can i try your glasses on" from friends, or co-workers.  </p><p> </p><p>The girl I worked with before, who I've posted about previously who had a high prescription, swapped glasses with me once, more because I was intrigued about how strong hers would be compared to mine - this was before she got her latest increase. I think at the time she was -7.50 and -8.75. She instantly told me my -7's were too weak and started laughing saying things were a bit blurry, I don't think the read add in helped much either! I loved the feel of her glasses, they were some cute black metal framed Tommy Hilfiger's and she didn't have the thin lenses either which was refreshing, but her glasses were a bit too strong for me - obviously! </p><p> </p><p>I checked Zenni Optical out, and they do 1.5 index lenses for free if you buy frames from them, which it would appear (at least to me) to be the "glass" lenses you are referring to? They only do them up to -6 prescriptions though, but as they ship worldwide this would seem to be a good place to buy glasses/lenses from for the lower prescriptions with thicker lenses. What prescription are you now?</p><p></p><hr>

You are correct form what I see on screen they look like nice styles and good prices. As you may know I have ordered hundreds of glasses from zenni optical over the past 8 years (because mostly of my work with a volunteer vision group) and they are very good as well , but it helps having another outlet to use and I will be giving them a try very soon. May I ask which ones you ordered from there? One thing that is nice is that you say they deliver in about a week, zenni is 2 weeks. That is nice in the case of someone loosing or breaking their glasses and being without correction.</p><p></p><hr>

If this is the case your near vision problem may be due to this,and with the proper cylinder in your lenses,you would be able to read clearly with your -7.00s and no bifocal. Then you could be more aggressive in bumping up your Rx. </p><p> I am curious, how many friends,and family know that you have induced myopia? What about your husband,or boyfriend. </p><p> I have induced up to -5.00, and family and friends think that my vision changed quickly, but never say much.

The prices seem to be around $88.00 for most all of them and that includes single vision lenses with AR coating. I am in the states and it looks like you must live in Canada to place an order. So anyone in Cananda can get a great deal on designer glasses way under market value. By the way it looks like they carry all major designers. </p><p></p><hr>

Also not sure why you want to shop in Canada, but if you look at "zennioptical.com" they are home based in California, but they are international. So shipping should not be a problem. They take 14 days in most cases form the date of your order. The advantage is price, they offer many styles ranging from $8.00 - $around $21.00, add $5.00 for AR coating or sunglass tint. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2010, 16:42</p><p>I gave Zenni a try for my glasses (-15.) Since they don't do myodiscs they made them in biconcave lenses which I have had before. But they split the prescription almost evenly between the front curve and the back. So the front curve is about -7 and the back is -8. It makes for a very interesting looking lens. The vision is good except for distortion around the edges which my myodiscs don't have so I have to look even more through the very center than with the myos. But I've never seen such a high minus front curve ( I think the highest I've ever had was maybe -3 on the front.) Way exotic.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Highmyope</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2009, 20:52</p><p>Correction: "The curve on the back *doesn't* reach all the way...."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Highmyope</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2009, 20:50</p><p>SZ6, </p><p> </p><p>As a former optical lab monkey, I can say that Zenni almost certainly didn't "shave down" the lens edges. Rather, those flat "shelves" are actually the back of the lens blank the lenses were ground from. The curve on the backside don't reach all the way to the edges of the frame because of a combination of: 1) the curvature that was needed for the Rx, 2) the width of the frame and (again) 3) the blank thickness--in this case, 12 mm. </p><p> </p><p>The key (and the challenge) is to get the lab to use the thickest blank possible when they cut the lens. (The thickest blank I'm aware of was about 18 mm.) Sadly, because of this lens-blank limitation--which is particularly characteristic of high-index lenses--there probably is no way to get actual "inch-thick" lenses....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SZ6</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2009, 12:17</p><p>gwgs, </p><p> </p><p>I just received my -16.75 glasses from Zenni today. Zenni did honor my requests to keep the edges unpolished and unbeveled. However, they did shave down the edges of the lenses to enable the temples to close, generating a not-insignificant myodisc effect when looking at the glasses from the front. I had hoped that they would not shave down the backs of the lenses at all and would simply set the lenses slightly forward in the frame (resulting in them sticking out significantly at the front) to enable the temples to close. The lenses are perhaps close to 12mm thick after being shaved down. </p><p> </p><p>Overall, I'm fairly satisfied. But at some point, I would really love to purchase some glasses for GOC with lenses approaching 2 cm or even 1 inch in edge thickness. </p><p> </p><p>What do you all think would be the best way to achieve this? Is it easier to get such specialized requests honored by Optical4Less? What's the maximum lens thickness you've been able to get Zenni to produce, and what did you need to ask them in order to achieve it?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SZ6</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2009, 06:59</p><p>Hi mickey, </p><p> </p><p>The trick seems to be to follow up your order with an email to Zenni referencing your order number and spelling out the request very plainly. I e-mailed them last night restating my wish for no beveling or polishing, and by this morning they had responded saying they would honor the request. </p><p> </p><p>They did, however, seem to balk at fitting -16.75 mid-index lenses into a 53mm wide frame, and suggested four others with eye sizes 50mm or under. Since the customer is always right, I instructed them to go ahead with the 53mm frame unless it was physically impossible to fit with the required lenses. </p><p> </p><p>Crossing my fingers that they'll be able to do it...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eye Tri</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2008, 14:40</p><p>Optomist, </p><p>The post from Cut-in UK has some good information, but didn't answer your questions. When you look at a frame, you will usually see two numbers stamped on it. This set of numbers is the frame size,and is important to how the frame fits your face. Say the frame you are looking at is stamped 48 20. The first number is the horizontal width of the lens opening. The second number is the distance between lenses, and is the bridge size you asked about. The bridge size determines how the frame fits your nose. You also asked about temple length. On most temples, the part that bends down behind the ear is about 32mm ( or 1 1/4" ) long, so subtract that from the overall length. Probably the best way to figure out what works is to go to an optician's shop, try some frames on, and pay attention to the size numbers on frames that fit.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cut-in UK </b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2008, 13:15</p><p>Optimist, the bridge measurement is non-critical, and depends on the design of frame.It is typically 18 - 20 mm. The important measurement is the PD(pupillary distance) i.e. the precise distance between the centres of the pupils when both eyes are looking dead ahead. This is to ensure that the optical centres of each lens are fitted in the frame in line with the eyes to optimise vision.( You need the PD and it may often be shown on an existing prescription, but not always.) If you examine a spectacle frame three sets of numbers are printed; usually on the temple ( side arm ). In order, they are; diagonal width of lens, bridge width and finally the full length of the temple from hinge to tip, all in millimetres. </p><p> </p><p>If your existing frame has no visible numbers, it's probable that they have worn off with use. If you visit an optometrists shop, try a style that suits you, and make a note of the three numbers, which will give you an idea of the size of frame that suits you. You can then order, through the web, a similar style and size that will be likely to fit you well. In fact you can alter the fitting on the temples, by heating (hair drier or hot water) then bending,if they need adjusting.   Hope this helps.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Optimist</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2008, 03:33</p><p>I'm minded to order glasses from an online retailer but I see that one of the measurements they require is the bridge size. Has anyone any advice on how I measure this, or how I check the size of my present glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Also I see that the length of the 'legs' (excuse if this is not the correct term) is to the end, whereas I would have thought the critical measurement would be to the 'bend' over the ear. </p><p> </p><p>I'm sure you can tell I've not done this before</p><p></p><hr>

Most of the frames i prefer have a 26mm height. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2007, 19:06</p><p>Hi, I just want to say that you don't have to tell O4L any stories.  You can, for example, be upfront about glasses for GOC (not your real prescription) or any preferences that you may have.  The only issues are whether they can actually do it and the price.  If you see a frame you like just tell them exactly what lenses you want and ask for a quote.  Good luck.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hey sourgrapes and SZ6!</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2007, 18:13</p><p>Why not try telling them that you wear contact lenses most of the time and already have a very expensive pair of high index glasses for a back up? All that you are looking for is simply a back up for the back up which will probably never ever get worn.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2007, 09:31</p><p>Sourgrapes, </p><p>CR-39 has very few downsides it's index is about 1.50.  The fashionable thing (big market) today is very thin lenses which means high index.  Most makers offer an antiscratch coating. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2007, 09:27</p><p>SZ6, </p><p>I think Zenni uses mostly polycarbonate. </p><p>Sourgrapes, </p><p>You need to contact O4Ls Special Makings Department.  I would try sending an email to admin@optical4less.com </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sourgrapes</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2007, 09:22</p><p>I'm also curious about this. I noticed O4L only lets you order CR-39 up to -5. They insist on high-index lenses for higher prescriptions; I got stuck with 1.67's if I wanted to get the cheapest. There are distortions near the edges, as I've read is pretty normal with high index. </p><p> </p><p>However, has anyone had any luck getting O4L to make them higher perscription CR-39 lenses? I know you can place custom orders; how much extra do they charge for such orders? Also, are there any downsides to CR-39 besides thickness (that's not really a downside, hehe)? I have also read they have less distortions near the edges. How prone are they to shattering or scratching? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SZ6</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2007, 09:03</p><p>How accommodating are the various online retailers when it comes to catering to our OO desire for really thick lenses? I ordered some -19.75s from Zenni and requested that they bevel the lens edges as little as possible - just enough so the temples could close. They complied reasonably well, but I still feel like the lenses could have been thicker. </p><p> </p><p>For those of you who have purchased from Zenni before: what frames did you get to maximize the lens thickness? Did they comply with your request well? </p><p> </p><p>For those who have purchased from other online retailers: could you recommend a men's frame that's conducive to fitting really thick lenses? Say one that has the hinges set well back from the frame, giving the temples more space to close over thick lenses? </p><p> </p><p>I'd love to get a pair that were around 20 mm thick, but am at a bit of a loss as to how to do this cheaply and effectively online.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>CaliRN</b>&nbsp;01 Sep 2006, 09:44</p><p>Good Morning al, </p><p>I just found this site trying to research online eyeglass and CK companies. It's great! </p><p>A couple of comments.... </p><p>*I'm looking at zennioptical, looking for a discount coupon code? </p><p>and </p><p>*I ordered from 39dollarglasses, shiping took longer than expected, and when I rcvd the glasses, the frames were not at all the color I ordered, also they were horribly mis-shapen, I couldn't even wear them. They did replace the frames, very quickly, in fact, however the color is STILL not what I selected.....oh well. I also can't seem to see very well out of them...I don't know if the Rx is wrong or what??? </p><p>*And last but not least....is it possible to convert a CL Rx to a eyeglass Rx...the power, specifically? I know it is not the same, but wonder if there is a formula for conversion. </p><p>Thanks all and have a great labor day weekend! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;31 Aug 2006, 09:29</p><p>laulau, </p><p>I'm not sure how they handle the logistics of getting the glasses to you.  I believe that for the US, they ship in bulk from China to their US office via air freight and then mail them on from there.  For Europe, they may have a more efficient way to do it.  The ideal thing would be to ship in bulk from China to a central European location and then mail them individually from there. </p><p>When you get them, be sure and check the postmark to find out where they were mailed from.  With todays global communications and logistics, it is hard to know exactly where anything is really located. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

If you don't have an accurate measurement of your PD, like from the doctor's exam, or a previous pair of glasses, you might want try the budget optical stores like Sears Optical (when they have one of their $99 sales), Walmart Vision, or Costco.  If you have a good used pair of frames, Walmart will put new lenses in cheaper than many online places charge.</p><p></p><hr>

This company is in pakistan and if you choose the free shipping, it can take anywhere from 4 or more to get your order.  But the biggest reason is, they mess up your prescription.  I ordered 2 pairs and both were wrong (which took 2 months to receive). The one of the replacements were wrong also. Out of 4 pairs of glasses, I could only wear one pair. Plus they don't reply to your emails. Only way I got them to respond was to file complaint with the company that processes their credit card payments.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2006, 02:28</p><p>CircleBox - No, I am in Wales and we don't have Walmart here - but we do have Asda which is part of Walmart, and the opticians in there let you buy just frames. If they are priced complete with lenses, just ask what they charge for lenses, and they should deduct that from the total. With the two-for-one offers, or any special offers, that usually only applies if you get complete glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>CircleBox</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2006, 19:15</p><p>Katy, have you gone to a Walmart and done this? That is what I am thinking of doing... I wonder how the prices range. I would rather have a pair of glasses that look good and spend extra money. I was thinking too about all those comercials that say '2 complete pair of glasses for such and such price (generally under $100). I guess I will have to look around...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2006, 11:07</p><p>Circlebox - I do that all the time, it's fine. I just say 'I'd like these, but with no lenses', and then get the lenses put in at a discount place. They don't ask why, but if they did, I would say I didn't have my rx with me, or that I could only afford the frames at the moment. None of their business anyway! Where the frames are priced complete with lenses (like Specsavers here), they deduct the cost of the lenses. Once I saw some nice 'budget' ones in Specsavers, complete price £39, asked for them without lenses, and they came to £9 - bargain! :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>CircleBox</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2006, 21:13</p><p>OK so I am sick of ordering glasses online because they either don't look good or break. If I went to say a Walmart optical, could I find frames that I like and just buy the frames with plastic lenses? Then I could send them to Optical4less.com to get the RX that I wanted. Also if people think it is possible, what on earth would I tell the people at the optical store? I could say my uncle is an eye doctor in a really small town and there isn't much to choose from and I just wanted to pick out a nice frame and he does the lenses free... I would feel like an idiot, especially if they say I can't do that. I guess I could call first because if they say no, I just won't go there and there is no harm done...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>teddy</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2006, 12:38</p><p>I just got glasses from goggles4you.  The postal carrier and my hubbie both thought that the package was suspicious, being from Pakistan and wrapped up in fabric.  They settled down when I told them what it was.  My only problems were that the specs needed adjusting so that I could see properly and that they did not roll and polish the edges as I asked.  But, what can you expect for 26 bucks?  I am going to try to find out if there is a local optician that will do the roll and polish for me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jolene</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2006, 05:07</p><p>Have just had a nitemare experience with Coastal Contacts www.coastalcontacts.co.uk.  Just so that you all know, if you click the Buy Now button - thats you bought your lenses - you don't need to enter credit card details - you also don't need to enter Doctor's details (apparently according to them this is not required in the UK).  My main frustration is that I clicked Buy Now, saw the request for Doctor's info and thought forget it - don't have an up to date prescription just leave the site.  After receiving an email confirming the order (which stated payment by giro or credit card) - I sent them a reply saying No thanks, please cancel.  Well the contacts arrived regardless! - too late for me however as I'd already got myself down to the opticians, had an eye exam and paid offline.  They are now saying I have to pay to return the lenses! even though I didn't order them AND cancelled the order.  I'm sure they offer good service if you just buy as normal, don't try anything complex like returning or cancelling your order.   I have suggested they clarify their website...if the doctor's information is not required they should say so - If I'd known I would have continued and paid.  But I'm glad I didn't - they have been so rude - their comment was "we won't pay for returns just for the good of our health!" - what about for customer service then? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brille</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2006, 10:30</p><p>The lenses from Gogglse4U seem to be positioned in the centre of the frames giving the same thickness at the inner and outer edges. I suppose you get what you pay for. On the positive side I have received 2 very good pairs of glasses with a correct PD, only because I chose the approprate frames. The customer service is good and the sewn bag packaging is a nice touch.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2006, 14:04</p><p>Hi - I had the same problem with the wrong p.d. from goggles4u recently - I ordered -6 glasses for my boyfriend whose p.d. is 60, and after wearing them for a while he started seeing double! When I measured the p.d. in them, it was 72 - and like yours, the lenses are right in the centre of the frames. The cylinder axis is also a few degrees out, and with a cyl of -1.75, it is causing a bit of blur.  </p><p> </p><p>I suppose with lower rxs, the p.d. doesn't matter much, and so not too many people complain. I might try &amp; get them replaced but not sure if its worth the hassle - they were only £15. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sad</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2006, 00:18</p><p>Its said they can't even make you a proper P.D. Glasses without correct P.D. are unusable . I think I will not order from this place . BTW I have heard a lot of bad stories about this company . Good luck .</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2006, 07:07</p><p>Hi, that problem with the wrong PD is very disappointing.  What a pain!  I ordered frames that put the optical centres in the lens centre, (1 lens width: 46mm + nose width: 19mm = PD, 65mm) so I didn't have that problem. </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if they had been getting complaints about glasses arriving damaged because mine arrived incredibly over-packaged.  They were wrapped in cotton-wool, inside a fancy case.  The case was in bubble wrap inside a thick styrofoam box.  The whole package was covered in sewn cloth with my address penned on it! I've never seen anything like it.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hi</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2006, 06:30</p><p>I also purchased 2 pair from goggles 4 u in the -18 range, They were fast, I would say there quality is in the fair to good range.  I ordered plastic lenses and was given glass, which chips very easily.  Upon arrival 1 lens in each pair was poped out of the frame, which I was able to fix myself.  Most importantly, they will not make my glasses with a proper PD.  I require a PD of 56, they are giving me a PD of 68 to 70, which is way to wide for me especially with such a high Rx.  They advertise high index, CR-39 and crown glass are NOT high index, but my lenses are thin, this is because they will not give them to me with my PD. they are centering the lenses to the frame, there is equal edge thickness on the inside and the out side edge, its great that they are thin but I can't wear them because of the induced prism I am getting.  </p><p> </p><p>Good luck with them</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2006, 06:18</p><p>Hi Brille, I got glass lenses, thinking they would be a little thinner than CR-39.  They have perfectly flat fronts with no AR coating so they flash quite nicely.  The edges are rolled and without edge polishing they appear white but not bad, I'd say.  I'm very pleased with the workmanship.</p><p></p><hr>

I was there a number of years ago. They gave me the wrong prescription. They made me wait two hours while the three young clerks socialized w/their friends. The frames they sold me keep bending.

The only reason I found out is because I looked at the insurance EOB and called to find out why I received duplicates. </p><p> </p><p>And guess what -- they would not assist me at the store.

I'm still waiting on my order from optical4less.com made on the same day.

<p><b>you</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2005, 05:23</p><p>I have ordered from goggles4u.com.  It will take 4 to 5 weeks to the US.  If you ordered a very high RX, -18 and higher, they will only make them in glass.  As far as using high index material, they don't! What they do is ignore your PD measurment and place the lenses optically centered into the frame, that way they can limit edge thickness and the is equal on both the inside and outside edge.  They seem to never give you a direct answer to any of your questions.  Good luck!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>CircleBox</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2005, 22:40</p><p>Anyone else ever ordered from goggles4u.com? I am having some issues as far as my order goes, they have great communication with e-mails but I am not get my questions answered. Not sure if I would deal with them again.

<p><b>CircleBox</b>&nbsp;19 Sep 2005, 20:37</p><p>I ordered from goggles4u.com, I had not heard much feedback on here about them. We will see how fast they arrive and the quality and I will let you know. I only paid $24.99 but the reviews on the website were good. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Don K</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2005, 15:40</p><p>I just ordered from optical4less.com and myeyeglasses.net - I will let you all know how it goes once I get them. Here's looking forward to the end of overpriced frames.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2005, 05:29</p><p>Peter - thanks - it would be nice to get them replaced and maybe I am being cynical, but I really expect them to either say they haven't received them, or that I have scratched them myself. Going on what I have read about them in previous posts (and should have read before I ordered!), and my own experience, I don't think they are particularly honest. When I sent them the photo (a jpeg), they said they couldn't open it, and then refused to say what file types they _could_ open - a bit dodgy. I'm glad yours were fine though! I think it is just a gamble really - some people will be lucky - but the complaints about them do seem to outnumber other retailers by quite a few.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;07 Sep 2005, 21:25</p><p>Katy, I've ordered from a number of online places and while the 2 pairs I've gotten from Optical4Less have both been excellent when I received them, I did have a problem with Goggles4U.  They said to send the glasses back, which I did, and they returned a new pair to me.  I think this seems pretty normal.  You may wonder if they will deliver a new pair, but they have an equal right to wonder if you actually want to keep the pair you've complained about (yes, there's a scratch, but I don't think that negates the point).  I think you should send them back and expect a new pair.  (You still might not want to order from them again, but at least get your 2nd pair of glasses.) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>CircleBox</b>&nbsp;07 Sep 2005, 21:24</p><p>Peter- Yes I would still like to find a home for my glasses. The RX is -3.25, with a PD of 63 and there is no astigmatism in them. Let me know what you think.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;07 Sep 2005, 21:21</p><p>CircleBox -- sorry, been away a while.  If you're still trying to unload those glasses from Zenni...Is there any astigmatism correction in those glasses?  Do you have the exact prescription and PD measurement?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2005, 15:38</p><p>Reporting back on the plastic specs I ordered from Optical 4 Less, as promised... one pair was fine but the other came with a big crack / scratch across the front of the frame. I sent a photo and asked for a replacement frame but they are refusing unless I send the glasses back. I don't see why I should pay out extra, for postage costs to Hong Kong, when the fault is theirs, and I would have no guarantee that they would replace them. Has anyone had a similar problem? Or managed to get a replacement without actually returning the glasses? I definitely won't be ordering from them again! :-(</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2005, 20:23</p><p>Jem, a friend of mine used Optical4less recently, and he was completely satisfied - his daughter's glasses were about $163.00 US for a beautiful pair of rimmless in around a -12.50D prescription</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jem</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2005, 17:04</p><p>No, they are 4 years old.  Started scratching within a week.  I don't want the same product.

<p><b>Sandy</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2005, 09:41</p><p>Jem, how long did you have the glasses?  Pearle should replace the lenses if it was within a year.  I returned one pair with no problem and they redid the lenses for no charge.  Take care.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jem</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2005, 05:44</p><p>hi- I'm in need of new specs.  Got my last pair at Pearle Vision microthins plus. Very disappointed as they scratched so easily.  Worse pair I've ever had but also the thinnest.  I have a -9 perscription and would like to try purchasing hi-index quality len pair online - perhaps Seiko lens.  Can anyone recommend an online store with an emphasis on quality with a good price.  I paid $400 for the Pearle pair.  If I could get a GOOD pair for 200-250 I'd consider that worthwhile.

<p><b>CircleBox</b>&nbsp;31 Aug 2005, 14:04</p><p>Dunno if anyone has ever done this before but I ordered glasses from Zenni optical, there is absolutely nothing wrong with them except I don't like the color on me. I was thinking of putting them on ebay but I thought I would post here and see if anyone would be interested. They are semi-rimless, -3.25, silver. They are just sitting there collecting dust, which is a shame, but I am sure someone could enjoy them or add them to their collection. I would not ask for much as they were only $30 or so including shipping.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;30 Aug 2005, 15:19</p><p>I had recommended Optical4less to a friend of mine who has a very strong prescription.  He didn't seem to take me up on my recommendation, so I wasn't too worried that my recommendation would backfire on me.  However, he has just called me to thank me for letting me know about them. He says his glasses are the nicest pair he has ever had in his prescription(around -24D) . He also ordered a pair of rimless for his daughter, who was told that rimless was impossible to make in her around -12D prescription. He tells me she loves her new glasses. And the best part was that he got both pairs for less than what one pair would have cost him. </p><p> </p><p>So, while this is not an out and out endorsement for O4less, this is a positive report.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ruth</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2005, 11:22</p><p>Thanks for your quick replies guys. Some food for thought there. I particularly like the groovy make up glasses in the link, although getting a lens fitted in my rx seems like it might be very expensive.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Aug 2005, 12:04</p><p>Ruth - my eye doctor has some low power (plus/minus 0.25) lenses on a 6 to 8 inch shaft that he occasionally uses for a quick check.  I never paid much attention to them but I suspect that a lens of any power could be easily mounted in this type of lens holder. </p><p> </p><p>You didn't mention your Rx but if your Rx is about the same in both eyes, you could ask an optician to make a lens of slightly less than your distance Rx so it would focus at the distance from your face to the mirror X2 (the light has to go from your face to the mirror and back to your eye. </p><p> </p><p>Another possibility would be glasses on a "stick" that the ladies used at the opera before contact lenses.  Also, you mihgt be able to use an old pair of glasses by removing the temples and attaching a rod on one side. If the frames are metal, I'll bet a clever jewelry maker could do it an about 15 minutes while maintaining access to the screw that locks the lens in place. </p><p> </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ignotus</b>&nbsp;24 Aug 2005, 11:43</p><p> </p><p>Ruth, I have seen glasses made esp. for putting make-up on. Each lens flips up, leaving room to apply make-up while seeing with the other eye. Your optician will know about these. Use lenses from an old pair so that it is not too expensive.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ruth</b>&nbsp;24 Aug 2005, 10:47</p><p>I'm partially sighted and extremely myopic too which means it's very difficult for me to apply eye make up. I had a brilliant idea the other day, a lens (myodisk) on a stick. This would be ideal as I could hold it over one eye with one hand while applying make up to the other eye. Does anyone know where I might be able to acquire such a thing?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2005, 02:35</p><p>Steven - I hope it works out. I think in the past people have usually managed to get a refund, but minus the paypal fees, after sending the glasses back. </p><p> </p><p>Has anyone ordered rimless from www.goggles4u.com recently? They are an incredible $25, but the lens options are very confusing - they say their lenses are all hi-index, but the drop-down lists show CR39 as the standard/cheapest option. I emailed to ask and got this: </p><p> </p><p>'All lenses that we are using are hi index lenses. In rimless frames we can only use CR39 material due to durability issues. We assure you if you place order your glasses will be produced with high index lenses.'  </p><p> </p><p>Now I am even more confused! I would prefer low index - does anyone know what kind of lenses they use?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Steven James</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2005, 23:26</p><p>I have bad news to report about Optical 4 Less. It is the second time we have ordered from them, the first time was for my wife in a fairly strong prescription. This time, I ordered for myself a brown plastic frame in a -2.5 (my Rx). The frame and colour were confirmed correctly on my confirmation email. The other day I received the glasses, but the frame was what could only be described as a luminescent PINK! Obviously (well, obvious to me) I cannot wear these.....and O4L have been COMPLETELY uncooperative in this matter, refusing to send what I ordered. I recall from the first time a helpful man by the name of Albert, but he seems to have evaporated on this occassion.....and I have just hit a brick wall. I really am not one of those detractors who wants to flame O4L....this is a real experience that has happened to me and want prospective buyers to beware. They ARE cheap....but their attention to detail is highly lacking!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hi Gobbler</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2005, 19:07</p><p>If you are in the US, there is a chain called "For Eyes" that often runs deals like 2 complete pairs with normal plastic lenses for $99.  I once asked if there was a prescription maximum for that price.  The clerk, who may have been the optician, told me that he usually recommends high index for higher prescriptions, but has had customers order regular plastic in a -10Rx, because they usually wear contacts and the glasses were only to be worn for a few minutes in the morning and at night.  I'm sure that if you told the clerk that you wore contacts 99.99% of the time, that they would respect your decision and not try to upsell you to the high index.  Oh, there is also a chain called "America's Best" that has 2 pairs for $69, but I have never dealt with them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2005, 06:18</p><p>I ordered a -16 pair from Zenni a while back, semi-rimless.  There were a couple problems - one lens had a distortion in it, one of the lenses had the groove for the 'fishing line' cut unevenly, and one of the 'fishing lines' broke while the lenses were in their case after I had the glasses perhaps a year.

Our satisfaction is valued so if we are not happy with your order you can return the glasses within 4 weeks and for ONLY 1/2 the cost of the item plus shipping and handling- you can get new glasses. If they mess up your order, shouldn't they refund you in full or give you new glasses?!?!?!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;03 May 2005, 07:23</p><p>Although Goggles4U has a small selection of frames, my experience with them was very good.

<p><b>Luke</b>&nbsp;03 May 2005, 05:51</p><p>I've ordered both rimless and semi-rimless from zenni.  (I have never ordered a metal-rim pair from them.) </p><p> </p><p>The rimless pair was fine, though they looked a little different from what I expected. </p><p> </p><p>The semi-rimless: I've ordered two pairs - one with a weakish (-2/-3) Rx, which turned out fine, one with a very strong Rx (-15) which had a couple problems - one of the lenses was distorted and the fishing line around one of the lenses was crooked (they messed up making the groove).  At some point, this fishing line broke, despite little wearing of these glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Bottom line: this is the cheapest store online, I believe.   Their quality is distinctly lower than most other places - so you sort of get what you pay for.  But I think as long as you don't get a really high Rx, the glasses *should* be OK.  I've heard stories about difficulty with customer service (no responses to email, etc).  But haven't had any major problems myself.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;02 May 2005, 15:06</p><p>The ones that I got were not edged very well so the lens pops out and when it is in they are uneven.  Stay away. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;22 Apr 2005, 13:27</p><p>College Girl -- good luck in your search.  If you get a chance, post how things go -- I'm curious. </p><p> </p><p>Not sure if your vision is still changing a lot, but for what it's worth, I think -6 is a prescription where it's still pretty easy to get nice looking glasses.  That's around the range where I am too.  I've seen glasses around -12, and at that prescription, you have to spend a boatload of money to get them to look at all normal, and even then it's a stretch.  At -6, it's really not too hard to get a nice looking pair of glasses.  Even rimless, which tend to make glasses look thicker than other frame styles, really look fine at -6 -- I've had several people compliment mine (and I presume they aren't optic obsessives).  These lenses are polycarbonate, which are cheap/"free" at a lot of online stores. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>College girl</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2005, 17:08</p><p>Leon and Mark, thanks for your advice. I might go to some stores this weekend and I'll let you know if anything exciting pops up. I hate those websites that say free lenses, unless your vision sucks, which means over -4. The costs of crappy vision...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2005, 09:41</p><p>College Girl - I think the best combination of price and trustworthiness might be www.39dollarglasses.com.  I don't know that they have a frame real close to what you want, but their prices are really good.  I think they have a pair that sort of looks like what you want. </p><p> </p><p>You're going to have to pay more for higher index, no matter who you go with.  39dollarglasses provides polycarbonate lenses for $39.  It costs $50 extra for very high index (1.67) lenses.  That's still real cheap for a pair of glasses.  At 47mm eyesize, your -6 script will have some thickness in polycarbonate, but not a whole lot.  The 1.67 index lenses will really be quite thin...probably thin enough that someone would think (from the thickness alone) that they are weak glasses.  Either way it's a good deal. </p><p> </p><p>www.zennioptical.com seems to be the cheapest place online, but some people here have had problems ordering from them and their quality is inconsistent.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Leon</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2005, 01:38</p><p>College girl: you might want to try <a href="http://www.eyewearcentre.com./" target="_blank">http://www.eyewearcentre.com.</a> It's an Italian eye wear store. Great customer service, quite cheap.  </p><p> </p><p>These look a bit like the ones you posted: <a href="http://www.eyewearcentre.com/grncgi/gladitem.pl?ITMCD=DKAR_8610TITANIUM&amp;LNGCD=eng&amp;SESID=IFAFVI-KG5" target="_blank">http://www.eyewearcentre.com/grncgi/gladitem.pl?ITMCD=DKAR_8610TITANIUM&amp;LNGCD;=eng&amp;SESID;=IFAFVI-KG5</a> </p><p> </p><p>By the way, don't worry too much about lens thickness, these frames are quite small.

So the net effect is that they're very, very heavy but only about 9mm thick at the edges.

So all in all, after my bitter experience, I have come to conclusion that O4L is not such a heck of a deal and is very risky on top of that. The O4L bastards seem to mess up lots of orders lately.

I ordered my first pair of glasses from them in September and they were delived within ten days. I expected them to break after a week, but they are stil going strong and seem to be of equal quality to those available on the high street. You should seriously give them a try (apparently the company was started by a twenty-one year old wiz kid; move over Richard Branson!)   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Foureyes Prim </b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2004, 07:34</p><p>I have worn prescription glasses for many years and have often been shocked by the high street prices. I once left a particuarly expensive store over £250 pounds short! Those were the old days. Recently my son informed me about a new business producing glasses for as little as £15.00! As you can imagaine I was very intreigued and looked them up on the web. I am pleased to say that two months down the line I have recieved three wonderful frames and will certainly be using the suppliars again. They go by the names of 'Glasses Direct' and they forfil their promises. I advise any glasses wearer to try them!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;01 Oct 2004, 15:22</p><p>Filthy, my sweet: when I was in college I got a new pair of glasses that made my eyes hurt. It was the only time I've ever had my eyes tested by an 'ophthalmic medical practitioner' and he put no cylinder in the left lens. I wasn't happy with them and went back; he satisfied himself that my acuity with them was 6/6 and sent me packing. But as long as I wore them (and he was the guy who insisted I should wear them full time) my left eye hurt. So it is possible. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;01 Oct 2004, 09:29</p><p>I think most people take any post that says a pair of glasses "make their eyes hurt" with a grain of salt.  I certainly do.  However, as with any Web-based business, on-line eyeglasses providers need to be approached with a certain degree of caution, particularly in view of the hassle of getting the product replaced or adjusted when it's got to be shipped overseas.  No matter how good the retailer, mistakes are inevitable at some frequencey.  That frequency may be low but is never zero.  I certainly appreciate that some retailers have been active in seeking out our little forum and offering us their services.  It's a big help for those who need to find a way to satisfy their fascination thgough a non-threatening channel.</p><p></p><hr>

My eyes can stand strong RX's but anything past -7 I can't focus well. I really want lenses around -2 or -3. Is there anywhere that I can safely send my frames to get these lenses put in without and RX from the doc and be assured that my glasses will come back to me?

<p><b>Helen</b>&nbsp;21 Aug 2004, 02:06</p><p>Monica, </p><p> </p><p>I am 35 and have had my eyes tested by two different optometrists in the last 8 months. </p><p> </p><p>In December, an optom. examined my eyes and told me that I would definitely need bifocals or varifocals soon. I have a mild rx for distance as well.  </p><p> </p><p>So, in April I got a pair of executive bifocals. Wore them for a bit, but then came to the decision that I could do just as well without them. I need the distance specs for television, reading airport arrivals/departure boards, theatre, but close and intermediate distances are fine. Wearing specs simply makes everything clearer. I am not bothered too greatly by astigmatism. </p><p> </p><p>A couple of weeks ago, I went to a different optometrist. Both my distance rx and reading add have gone up slightly. However, the optom. said that it would not be worth me getting bifocals or varifocals. I'd have my distance rx specs and just buy a pair of readers. The add is the same for both eyes 1.25.  </p><p> </p><p>On the day I picked up my spectacles, I also bought myself a pair of Foster Grant readers. I like the style of these rimless ones.  </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, Monica, good luck.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ree</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2004, 10:35</p><p> Monica. </p><p>  It depends on how old you are. And have you been advised reading glasses by an optician or a ophthalmologist.  Thats the ideal way.   </p><p>    If you need corection for simple presbyopia,, then most of the ready made available readers are ok,, anything other than that you need to get it tailor made for yourself. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2004, 08:37</p><p>If you can read easily through 'em, and your eyes don't feel misaligned when you put them on, and all you need is a presbyopic reading correction, there is no harm done.  If you need a hyperopic Rx (that is, if you need them to see clearly at all distances), then see an optometrist - they like to call themselves "doctors" - or an ophthalmologist (they really are doctors). </p><p>My optometrist is very good, technically speaking, if a bit of a doorknob socially; she diagnosed very small retinal perforations in my wife's eyes. The specialist who repaired them said that it was surprising, given the exquisite size and location of the perforations, that an optom was doing cycloplegic examinations that thoroughly.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Monica </b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2004, 07:14</p><p>I tried to join that board to ask a related question, having read their whole thread, but the e-mail still hasn't come. Maybe they don't want non-professionals on the board. So I'll ask here. Are reading glasses that are cheap no good? I don't mean the $1 jobs, but the $30 pairs they sell ready-made online and in department stores? They look quite good quality, and some are made by names I've heard of like Foster Grant. How do they compare quality-wise? We were quoted for a proper pair: $25 for frames, $50 for lenses, $80 for dispensings (these are Canadian $$) so a total of $155, which is lot more. Just trying to decide what to do.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dr.S.</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2004, 04:51</p><p>For those who like their glasses thick, here is another idea. There is a new online retailer located in Missouri USA www.safevision.net that offers industrial safety glasses for online purchase. They just quoted me $150 for a pair with -16.50 prescription. Remember that industrial lenses have to be made with a minimum 3 mm center thickness so the edges will be noticeably thicker than usual. They normally use polycarbonate lenses but will apparently provide other materials such as CR39 upon request. I have not ordered anything yet </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>WB</b>&nbsp;29 May 2004, 07:18</p><p>I guess the reason I have not ordered from Optical4less is because while I like their selection of frames they tack on an extra $59 for higher astigmatism corrections.  I have to say that the glasses that I've purchased from the online retailers have been  far superior to the ones I've gotten from my long-time optician, and I'm sitting right in front of him.  If we could get O4L to drop that additional cost for the high cylinder I'd buy  from them in a minute!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2004, 10:03</p><p>Sears is fine IF you are going there to by some socket wrenches or underwear. But to keep your eyes in their sockets, avoid Sears eyewear. </p><p>My ex girlfriend bought her glasses there because she is cheap. pair of nice semi-rimless complete for $100.00 She has an Rx for astigmatism and uses them only for the computer.. if at all. I tried without success once to get her to wear them full time after she said she couldn't read the credits during the end of a movie on TV and had to get up to see better. VANITY! She is going to school to become a nurse but she got squemish when seeing me put in contact lenses. Go figure!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dr.S.</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2004, 07:46</p><p>This isn't online but maybe relevant. On a recent business trip to Chicago, I took along a new pair of frames and a carefully made script (for a "cousin") for approx -17 lenses preferably in CR39. I dropped in at a store of the For Eyes chain, and after we got throught the usual back-and-forth about why high index lenses wouldn't do, the representative said that this prescription would be "very thick" if done in CR39 but would be no problem for their lab, and would cost only $44 to fill! I would have made an order there and then, except that my trip was too short. Later, I also visited the Sears store in downtown Chicago, where I asked several questions about what they could do for a very nearsighted relative - I was able to have a look at the lens options pages while the rep was flipping through the book, and I noticed that the highest prescription that they were able to fill in CR39 was -16.75 (at about twice the price charged by For Eyes for the same lenses). </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Trent</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2004, 18:52</p><p>Dr.S </p><p>I agree with you. I ordered CR-39 through Sears in a -9.5 power. It took them a month to come in and when they did they were done in hi-index.  High Rx plastic blanks must be getting hard to find.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dr.S.</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2004, 09:54</p><p>CR39 lenses in high minus powers are getting harder to obtain. In approaching online retailers, I usually start by asking if they can put new CR39 lenses in an existing pair of glasses for a prescription of about -16.50~-17. Most places just say no, but the following may be of interest. I have not ordered from any of them yet. Wohloptics recently verbally quoted $120 for replacement lenses. 39dollarglasses quoted $99 last summer. Nationaleyewearoutlet (a year ago) quoted $85 for replacement CR39 lenses of "any" power including the above range. Also, a year ago, eyeglassesinternational quoted me $75 for CR39 lenses (-16.50) in new glasses. For your info.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2004, 20:15</p><p>Since all you need to fake a presciption is your base curve, the diameter of the lens, and the spherical power of the lens in question, it would be very easy to fall into the EVIL and COMPLETELY EFFECTIVE practice of faking prescriptions.  One can get one's base curve by going to an optician and asking to be fitted for plano colored contacts.  Of course, it would be highly not nice and very BAD of you to use the information you obtain (probably for free) from the optician for the purposes of faking a presciption.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2004, 20:11</p><p>It would be inappropriate to fake a prescription.  Very inappropriate.  I do not advocate faking a prescription, because although it would undoubtedly be effective (as these online places merely want to cover their asses), it would be morally reprehensible, corrupt, and just plain BAD to fake a prescrition that would get you exactly what you want and never be checked.  Do not fake a prescription, whatever you do.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2004, 08:43</p><p>I think also we as a society have been trained to be polite and it makes us a bit malleable instead of demanding what we want (that we pay for!). That's why threads like this help - it gives ordinary people the correct technical terms to use to be able to say "I want THIS". It's a simple enough request, after all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>----</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2004, 08:29</p><p>the reality is that i bet some of the online retailers are the same ones the optical shops get their products from (It's not some guy in the basement grinding your lens all week)  </p><p>Maybe the success rate is better ordering online because it cuts out a (lack of) communication node</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Henry_c</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2004, 07:02</p><p>A Guest: </p><p>My Rx is unbalanced (L plano, R -3) so I have dealt with this before.

<p><b>A Guest</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2004, 17:03</p><p>Henry_c </p><p> </p><p>The timing of your response couldn't be better, as I just returned from the opticians a couple of hours ago- I was picking up my STILL unbalanced glasses.  Good luck was right; they never did figure it out.  Rather than try yet again I gave up, and I'll wear them as is.  The funny part of it all is that the $19 glasses DO have lenses that match; they totally thickened the one to match the other.  It appears that being there in person, having left the glasses with the optician several times AND paying a lot of money didn't have any effect on them matching the thicknesses of the lenses.  I'm not a pain in the rear usually, but obviously this is something I've dealt with my whole life so I know that it IS possible and I know that having one thick lens and one thin one really bothers me, as it is very very noticable.  I don't want to jinx the inexpensive glasses however, because I'm hoping that they can recreate the magic again in the future.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Henry_c</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2004, 14:22</p><p>A Guest:  </p><p> </p><p>Good luck trying to get opticians to match lens thickness. I have tried and it seems they don't want to do it. If a place that charges 20-40$ don't want to do it that's fine but when we talk about 200$ and up. I even said I was willing to pay extra. It was like I spoke a foreign language. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>A Guest</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2004, 11:13</p><p>I may be the strange one here but as I stated before, I've been very satisfied with each pair of glasses I've ordered from Zenni.  The most interesting thing is that I am very exacting in that I can really notice if my cylinder is slightly askew, or as noted previously, if one lens ends up being significantly thicker than the other.  I've gone round and round  IN PERSON with the opticians to no avail but somehow managed to get someone on the other end of this computer to actually understand my requests and make my glasses look decent.  Of course, there is always that inability to try on frames so it is a shot in the dark as far as that's concerned, but at $19 or $29 or $49 a pair, you can have a couple of pair on hand to choose from.  Goodness knows I've spent close to $400 on one pair in the past, and I can't really say I love them more than my cheapos.  Just my thoughts......</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;29 Feb 2004, 08:20</p><p>Apparently, they are placing the bifocal at a generic point.  And many people here are claiming they are totally happy with them.  So all those measurements the in-person optician takes must not be entirely necessary. Perhaps another reason to jack up the price of progressives?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>???</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2004, 20:25</p><p>How can an online retailer possibly fill an order for progressives?  </p><p> </p><p>Do they actually work?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>A Guest</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2004, 15:06</p><p>I recently received glasses that I ordered from Zenni and I'm very pleased with them.  Negating the fact that it's the first time I am trying lined bifocals (previously wearing just progressives, but the distortions and smaller reading areas just too much effort)and they're taking some getting used to, they did a great job with the bifocals and with a pair of single vision sun glasses.  Which is interesting considering I just returned my glasses to my regular optician for the FOURTH time because  they're still not right, and the lenses alone, in my own frame, cost more than both from Zenni combined, including the shipping!  I have an unbalanced Rx between my two eyes and they managed to make one lens thicker to match the other in both pair of glasses, as well as in two I've purchased from them in the past.  The guy at my opticians office can't seem to do the same thing, and he has the frames in his hand and supposedly even sent them to the lab.  SUffice it to say, I like Zenni.  Now if only they made executive bifocals or trifocals..... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dovesong</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2004, 15:09</p><p>Update on my earlier post...Feb. 27th I finally received my glasses from Zenni.  I ordered them on Jan. 9th.

I don´t know how good this machines do their job but as they cost around 14.000 usd I guess they are rather good. So that can be good advise for you out there who is interesting in GOC:ing </p><p> </p><p>In this way you get the right PD which is important, and also you know which CL to choose.  When I say this the cl:s I´m thinking of is 1-day-monthly which is very thinn and can´t harm much if they´re wrong, opticians even sell them to people who should have lenses with cyl, but they play with the amounts and sell for example acuvue just to be cheap.

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2004, 09:15</p><p>Alice...you don't need to fake a PD.  Get a friend to help.  Use a ruler with millimeters marked.  You look straight ahead.  Have your friend measure the distance between your pupils.  If you don't want to involve someone else, you may be able to do this yourself by looking in a mirror.

Because O4L was not able to fulfill my order, they refunded my money, minus $7 for PAYPAL fees. </p><p> </p><p>I received confirmation from PAYPAL, but guess what? PAYPAL charges ANOTHER $1.50 to refund your money via check. Paypal will not refund to the original credit card, but do have a way to avoid the $1.50 charge if you provide your checking account information for direct deposit.  </p><p> </p><p>Paypal already has my Credit Card info, address, phone#, etc... I'm not about to give them additional banking information. </p><p> </p><p>To conclude... I LOST $8.50 TO O4L because I used Paypal and because O4L couldn't fill the order.

I really don't think they lose out on their e-bay orders, like I said, by the time you pay the double shipping cost and your bid, it is probably cheaper to buy from their web site.

I asked for a refund, and for O4L to let me know when or if they can get the 1.9. </p><p> </p><p>I paid with PayPal... did you know that Paypal will not refund the full amount?

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2003, 07:38</p><p>Bethany...I would be happy to answer your question, even though it may open me up to comments like "what did he expect for that amount?"  I won the bid for $20.50.  This was the first ebay listing for O4L, so I think it attracted only 3 bidders because no one knew what to expect.  As I said earlier, they also tacked on $15 for shipping, which is more than twice what they charge on their website.  I knew at the time that I was getting a bargain for a complete pair of glasses, but I expected to get progressive lenses because no restrictions were listed and I thought the auction was a promotional deal.  If it was, then it backfired for both me and Albert of O4L, because neither of us enjoyed the transaction.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Johnnyb555</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2003, 08:21</p><p>Hey guys </p><p> </p><p>I also ordered from O4L. Ordered on 10/20, Albert sent me email (to my Yahoo account) with a question the next day, but Yahoo delivered it to the Bulk email folder. I found the msg on 11/9, replied, and on 11/11 Albert confirmed, saying it will e ready in 1 to 2 business days. It's been five days, status of glasses is "still being crafted". Oh well. To their credit, it is a very strong prescription. I asked for a contact telephone number five days ago, never heard back. </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if they'll hold shipment to spite me as well... hehe... I hope not.

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2003, 07:29</p><p>Having read posts here about O4L and also reading the feedback on ebay, I am convinced that my order was held up on purpose just to spite me.  I honestly bid on the glasses thinking that I would get progressive lenses since the listing did not have any lens restrictions.  Albert of O4L, however, made it abundantly clear that I could not expect him to honor the listing in such a way.  Would it have hurt his business to take a loss on one pair of glasses in order to gain my goodwill and keep me from posting negatively about him and his business?  Obviously, he didn't think so.  I will never ever order from them again.  I am glad, however, that the rest of you are being treated well.  And, I must admit, Albert learned from the experience...his newer listings now say single vision only.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2003, 04:53</p><p>yoni...the shipping alone took 18 days.  They took ten days to make the glasses.  There were an additional four days of arguing through email with Albert before we agreed on what he would make for me.  In all, that's a total of 32 days from winning (maybe a better term would be "losing") the ebay auction to receiving the glasses, which, I forgot to say earlier, were a different shape lens from what I ordered!  Once again, I want to warn anyone who is considering ordering from them about these problems.</p><p></p><hr>

Since he refused to give me what I wanted, even though his listing wasn't specific about single vision lenses only, I asked for single vision reading glasses.  The glasses I received are no better than over the counter readers that I could have bought for less than half of what I paid him.  Plus, he charged me $15 for the shipping, while he charges website users only $7.  I would not recommend O4L at all!  A funny note...he apparently, being Asian, did not recognize my name as one of a male.

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2003, 18:51</p><p>Russel, I'm sorry to hear that Albert and Optical4less did not give you the good treatment that you had every right to expect.  They have just come through for me bigtime!  Today I received my second pair of -24 myodisc glasses from them and I find them to be exquisitely made.  The bowls are only 20mm and the fronts are a tiny bit concave.  This results in glasses that very few people would spot as strong Rx.  They are incredibly thin and light.  I think the order took about a month and that seems to be a long wait but, in my experience, this can happen when high Rx glasses are ordered through your local optometrist as well.   </p><p>Albert's English language and general communication skills may be a bit rough but I have found him happy to supply what I ask for and only concerned to avoid problems and disappointments.  The key for me has been to be clear about exactly what I want and to calmly insist on just that. </p><p>I think whoever is making the high Rx glasses is a real expert. </p><p>I will post a few pics tomorrow. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2003, 09:59</p><p>Glad to hear that you all are getting good service from O4L.  I still haven't received my glasses, so I can't say whether I will be satisfied or not.  I do know that I was not impressed with Albert, as he used such phrases as  "Negative feedback is not an important thing for a 0 feedback new account . If you wanna write some negative , go ahead . I dont care."  Most ebay sellers do care about negative feedback.  That reply suggested to me that Albert did not care about customer satisfaction.  That being said, I am glad to hear that he has been good to you guys.  I assure you, his emails to me were not a "joke."  He was deadly serious when he refused to honor his ad on ebay and suggested that I should not even be expecting him to do so.  I did see, however, that his current ebay listing says "single vision only," so I guess I made an impact.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2003, 15:24</p><p>More on Optical4less...I won the ebay auction of theirs for a complete pair of glasses.  I sent my prescription, asking for progressive lenses.  The ebay description of the item I bid on did not say "single vision only."  Albert--the O4L administrator--adamantly refused to give me anything but single vision at the price I paid.  I knew I paid very little, but I also know that sometimes the winning bid on ebay often is less than the seller wanted.  After several emails back and forth, Albert agreed to make me single vision reading glasses.  Their tracking screen said "making in progress...3-6 days."  Eleven days later, the tracking screen finally said the glasses were completed and shipped.  I will update you when I receive them.  My point in all this is to warn you all that Albert is intractable--there is no arguing with him.  I don't think I would order from him again, but perhaps my mind will be changed when I see the glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SZ6</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2003, 14:34</p><p>It looks like they have increased the range of prescriptions they offer since the last time I ordered from them.  Too bad the very high prescription lenses are so expensive.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2003, 06:04</p><p>Specs4ever. </p><p> </p><p>Why would they market a range for children, and not an equivalent range for adults, which would seem a much bigger market. I am sure I am missing something.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2003, 04:36</p><p>Won't do a lot of us much good though, as the max bc is 8.3, and the largest dia is 12.5.  I need 9.0 and 15.0, and I suspect that these lenses are only for children</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2003, 04:33</p><p>I find that with the higher powers, the glasses prescription can be fine tuned by sliding the specs up or down the nose slightly.  The focal point of a pair of -45D glasses is something like 3/4" or somewhere around there. I have all the numbers, but they are stashed away for a while.  If you figure it out though, you will find that a very slight mvement of a pair of high powered minus specs will make the vision quite clear.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2003, 03:53</p><p>As these contact lenses are only available in steps of +3 dioptres at the high end, would a regular user have to wear glasses anyway to fine tune the prescription to the last dioptre or so?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>D-W-V</b>&nbsp;21 Oct 2003, 22:16</p><p>Don't worry about the Doctor's name and number.  Just make up a plausible name and phone number, and make sure your prescription doesn't have any errors in it.  If they do try to contact him and fail, they'll call you, and you can say that the Doctor retired or moved away.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoni039</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2003, 09:29</p><p>Hi D-W-V, </p><p> </p><p>Yup, they do have nicer frames than Optical4Less. Thanks for the links, but both sites ask for Dr's name and phone# as a requirement... and only go to -12. Oh well. </p><p> </p><p>Y.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ContactGirl</b>&nbsp;13 Oct 2003, 18:18</p><p>Joe, I went to lensmart.com -- i ordered freshlook colors and they ask me for my doctors details when I try to pay for it.  I know all the details of my current contacts, but want to get .50 stronger :)  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Newbie</b>&nbsp;09 Oct 2003, 07:24</p><p>I am wearing Freshlook - they are ok, but not comfortable for up to 3 hours after putting them on.

Thanks!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;09 Oct 2003, 06:06</p><p>Newbie - I'm not an expert, but I think it could cause the lenses not to fit well, which may mean they move a lot on your eye or don't move enough.  I think moving a lot would make them uncomfortable; I think not moving enough can promote eye infections and other oxygen deficit problems. </p><p> </p><p>But if you get them, you can probably tell if they fit.  Why do you want to try acuvue 2?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Newbie</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2003, 18:36</p><p>Hello All;  I have a question about Contacts that maybe you can answer.  I Currenly wear Freshlook Contacts. However, I want to try Acuvue 2 contacts -- The Base Curve on my prescribed lenses is MEDIAN w/ a Diameter of 14.5 However the Acuvue comes in a base curve of 8.3 w/ a 14.0 Diameter.  Is this going to cause any problems? I want to order online because of the cheaper price. I wear plano contacts for color b/c I wear glasses. I like having blue eyes ;-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tanya</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2003, 11:21</p><p>Maxine </p><p>     I know all about the frames you're looking for, they were the first glasses I ever put on when I tried on a classmate's glasses about 40 years ago and yes, they were pink. The girl and I became close friends and still are. An older guy at school wore the same style but in the dark brown colour. I think the frame style is called "windsor" I seem to recall looking at a John Lennon site and his glasses were called windsor style try typing in a search for windsor style glasses and see how you get on. The Ironic thing is, they will probably cost a fortune these days, in the 1960s you couldn't give them away! </p><p>         Tanya</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxine</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2003, 08:54</p><p>Letifan </p><p>        Yeah you're right about the frames of the early 90s being of a similar shape as the old NHS style,I even saw a guy wearing a brown pair complete with the wire earpieces and, yes the hinges were bright metal too. I want the glasses for theatrical purposes but I will have them fitted with my own RX </p><p>              Maxine</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2003, 03:41</p><p>Something very similar to the original NHS wire frames came back into fashion, at least in Britain, for a while in the nineties. These were black and started in the near-round lens shape I remember from the old NHS days. Many people wore them who did not suit them and looked almost as silly as the large brightly coloured plastic frames of a decade or so earlier.  </p><p>Pretty soon different lens shapes started to appear and the original NHS look was superceded. Maybe today's black metal ovals and rectangles are the natural development of this style. However, as I remember them, the NHS style always had the hinges in bright steel, never in colour. </p><p>Casting back to the NHS days, I remember the dark brown (which I always thought was black) and the pink (which was presumably intended for little girls). In my memory, little girls (and the Milky Bar Kid)sometimes wore white frames for a few years before changing to black or plastic. Pink was not common and I don't recall seeing any blue. </p><p>Then sophiticated plastic came in, and that's another story.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brille</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2003, 01:35</p><p>Maxine, </p><p> </p><p>I have been trying in vain to find British NHS glasses, I thought www.retrospecs.co.uk and framefinder.co.uk would help but it seems not. Nevertheless I still think they exist somewhere as a retro style. For a pair second hand you can try the charity shops in England. I would love a pair brand new in crystal and if anyone has information let me know. Anyway good luck Maxine.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxine</b>&nbsp;07 Oct 2003, 15:16</p><p>I am trying to get hold of the very old style of british NHS metal frames, they game in pink,blue or a dark brown colour, and had springy wire earpieces. They were hated by a generation of British school kids, but were also made in adult sizes. does anyone know if there is an online retailer (or anywhere) who sells these frames. I would be grateful for any assistance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brille</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2003, 07:48</p><p>I know there are a lot of posts regarding www.optical4less.com on the GOC thread but this one is appropriately called online retailers. I noticed today that there are a lot of frames out of stock so they must have received many online orders. I hope their selection improves, as with other on line services it is always difficult to find very small frames which would be more attractive for a strong Rx.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dr.S.</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2003, 05:13</p><p>There are some fairly recent additions to the US online retailers. One is eyeglassesinternational.com, Pompano Beach, FL. A while a go they quoted me $75 for a pair of -16.5 lenses in CR39. This website has a look and feel rather similar to eyeglass factory outlet, and offers a very similar range of inexpensive frames. Also there is eyewearoutlet.com, Livonia, MI. The latter place told me last week by email reply to my enquiry that they could do any prescription in CR39 no matter how strong, for $85 for a pair of lenses. They said -17 would be no problem. They will install new lenses in your frame if you mail it in. Does anybody have any experience with either of these retailers? Also note there is a business in Syracuse, NY called Eyeglass Lens Replacement or 8004eyeglasses.com that looked quite useful, however they told me they will not do anything above about -10.</p><p></p><hr>

One thing that has been a minor annoyance is that I got two different versions of the same frame and found that they fit very differently, as they were bent in different ways.  I think I can take care of this with a hairdryer and some work, but they have shown impressive (and annoying) resiliance going back to the shape I got them in. </p><p> </p><p>Good place, though, it seems (but all their lenses are polycarb or high index)</p><p></p><hr>
