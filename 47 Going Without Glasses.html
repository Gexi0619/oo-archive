<p><b>LeeHasang</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2018, 07:13</p><p>It was unavoidable at some occasions, We had to remove glasses for maybe ONE MINUTE. I assume She was a Minus or Miopia aged 10 to 20 , then after removing glasses, we girls all had 10 cm or 4 inch of reading distance . Obviously girls would not be able to read texts unless you place 10 cm from her. Possibly we needed one similarly miopia girl to help other miopia girl , that was Life. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LeeHasang</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2018, 00:23</p><p>I experienced the same, knowing some kids ... That was the time I was a child. </p><p> </p><p>Quote Likelenses. </p><p> </p><p>Growing up, I knew some kids that got their initial pair of glasses, but due to family financial conditions, went many years with the same outdated prescription, as every year they seemed to squint more, and many times the teacher would move them to the front row. </p><p> </p><p>On occasion, some of them would actually get out of their front row seats, and walk up to the board to see what was written on it. Some had frames that had home made repairs with tape or glue, or did not fit properly due to growth. </p><p> </p><p>A few when they did finally get new glasses, seemed to have a significantly stronger prescription, that they seemed to have trouble getting used to.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LeeHasang</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2018, 23:48</p><p>For reference, this can be an approximate example of the traditional writing posture, that is in Oriental World such as Japan , Ancient China . This posture can be taught by their teacher. When children SKEW (OBLIQUE) their body SIDEWAYS, CHILDREN can be planked by the teacher. Teacher may order you : Sit STRAIGHT (Zuo Zheng, Bu Yao Tuo Bei). Some other directions from teacher can include "Tou Zheng , Shen Zhi ". "Shen Zhi" means, Sit STRAIGHT (Zuo Zheng), CANNOT curve your BACKBONE (Tuo Bei is not allowed, at least for normal children). "Tou Zheng" means HEAD STRAIGHT. Cannot be OBLIQUE (SKEW or OBLIQUE is the same, OBLIQUE not allowed) , Swaying SIDEWAYS are not allowed, at least for normal children . NO curve BACK is allowed , for DISCOURAGE CHILDREN MIOPIA OR BACK PROBLEMS. In Ancient World, Children may develop into next generation of teachers. Good posture is important, otherwise children may be DISABLED with BACK and VISUAL problems at EARLY AGE before age 10 . </p><p> </p><p>Distance between paper and eyes. Traditionally,  at least 35 cm or 1 feet . When writing larger text , Paper can be more than 70 cm below eyes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Below .

<p><b>Antonio</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2018, 08:31</p><p>Hi Amber. Oh what a cruel new job for you!! </p><p>As I was for years going shortsighted and uncorrected in my youth like you,  </p><p>I.m the one who is very interested to know how you decided to go on ??? </p><p> </p><p>All the best, Antonio</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Joe West</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2018, 12:42</p><p>Amber, </p><p> </p><p>You can always get a job as a baseball umpire like me, Angel Hernandez, or CB Bucknor.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2018, 09:45</p><p>Amber </p><p>The decision about how much or when you should wear glasses is something that you need to decide. There is no glasses police. The only thing you are restricted is when it comes to driving. If your eyesight sn't good enough to pass the DMV vision test then you, by law, need to wear glasses when driving. Otherwise it is totally up to you.  </p><p>Now the situation you'r in now with your job is interesting because you clearly can't see well enough, without glasses, to do your job as good as you should. Your boss of course has every right to fire you if you choose not to go and get glasses and wear them at least while you're at work. He doesn't want to lose customers because you're walling right past tables with their food because you can't see the order number on the table. So i guess the question is, how bad do you want to keep that job. If you make good money from tips it might be well worth giving into wearing glasses at least while working. Sure beats eating out of a trash can.  </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Josh</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2018, 08:49</p><p>Amber i guess it´s time to get glasses for you, at least for work, you could still enjoying living in blur when you´re outside, but functionally it´s very necesary, at least you could try, your boss will be glad to pay for them, there´s a few jobs where you don´t need good vision, tell us what you decide</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amber</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2018, 07:48</p><p>Well here is an update.  I have no problems with living in a blur.  I like it 100 percent.  But my job ran into money problems and cut some of us.  So I had to make a decision about eating from trash cans or getting a new job.  A friend of mine told me about this pizza place that was hiring so I applied and got an interview.  But I felt some worries in my gut.  So to make a long story longer, I got the job and day one my nightmares came true.  When people order food, they get little numbers and put them at the table.  I don't care, I know where to bring food.  But it wasn't that way.  If you are not busy, you bring food to other tables too.  The small problem with that, with my blurry eyesight, I couldn't even begin to read those numbers from any normal distance.  I was walking around the restaurant with hot food bending down to read the number and squinting hard.  I also didn't see numbers I thought I saw and went right by people with their food.  omg it was an incredible struggle to do anything.  My boss saw me squinting hard and asked me if I have problems with my eyes.  First I wanted to tell him to mind his own business but then he asked me what a couple of signs said.  I told him I can't lie because I need glasses bad.  My boss said sharp vision is required for the job.  I was so pissed when I left work that night, but then I realized omg I have to work until late and my eyes suck so bad in bad light.  I had to make a decision.  I will leave you in suspense if you want to hear what I did let me know.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Apple77</b>&nbsp;05 May 2018, 10:30</p><p>Well, right  I never said it was pathbreaking. Also they could have just used plus lenses to achieve the same result more easily. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 May 2018, 00:56</p><p>jamesegg, </p><p>oops! The spell checker got me.  The Ciliary Muscles in your eyes are very tiny and potentially very strong for their size. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 May 2018, 00:53</p><p>jamesegg, </p><p>I would like to suggest that you are not doing yourself any favors by not wearing vision correction.  Let me explain why. </p><p>There may be important elements in your prescription that you did not mention, but you are actually "wearing" built in reading glasses with a power of +3.25 all the time.  Reading glasses with that power focus at a distance of approximately 30 cm or 12 inches, if you don't have any astigmatism as indicated by Cylinder and Axis in your prescription.  Everything beyond those distances is blurry. </p><p>Built in reading glasses of that power is great for reading and focusing close.  It even works for a computer if you can get close enough to the display. </p><p>Here is the snag.  The "auto-focus" system (your Crystalline Lenses and Ciliary Muscles) in your eyes is not getting ANY exercise.  Your Ciliary Muscles are probably very weak.  You know what happens to a muscle if you don't use it. </p><p>Normally, the Ciliary Muscles are the strongest muscles in the body for their size (very time), but I suspect, when you put on your glasses, you cannot focus close to read or use a phone, tablet, or computer.  If you can not easily and comfortably focus at intermediate and close distances with your glasses, you have the symptoms of a 40 - 50 year old with Presbyopia. </p><p>You did not mention your age, but but I suspect around 20 +/- a year or two.  If you experience what I described above, you need to understand that your experience is more common than you may think and typically it is not too hard to  re-condition your Ciliary Muscles, unless disuse has caused other problems. </p><p>Sometimes, several steps and prescription changes are necessary to recondition your Ciliary Muscles.  The first step that may have been done by your Eye Care Professional (ECP) is give you less MINUS than you actually need. Sometimes more significant things are necessary before you vision will function as it is supposed to. </p><p>I won't bore you with any more thoughts or suggestions unless you want me to.  I would like to ask you some questions, if I may? </p><p>0. Would you like some help with this?  If you are not interested, please say so. </p><p>1. Your age? </p><p>2. Your gender? </p><p>3. Year in University? </p><p>4. Desired course of study? </p><p>5. Where do you live? (country) </p><p>6. Have I described your situation with glasses correctly? </p><p>7. How is your experience different, when focusing close with your glasses? </p><p>8. Have you studied any of the Sciences or Math? </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jamesgg</b>&nbsp;03 May 2018, 22:06</p><p>got glasses a month ago with a prescription of -3.25 in both eyes.  first time and the doctor was shocked. </p><p> </p><p>however, i only wear them when necessary such as seeing the board in college classes-otherwise, i just go without glasses.  i'm used to it because prior to a month ago, that's how i went around anyways. </p><p> </p><p>who else does this?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2018, 22:25</p><p>Kelly </p><p> I sure hope that things are different for you today, and that you can afford glasses that you like, and that make you feel attractive. </p><p> Growing up, I  knew some kids that got their initial pair of glasses, but due to family financial conditions, went many years with the same outdated prescription, as every year they seemed to squint more, and many times the teacher would move them to the front row. </p><p> On occasion, some of them would actually get out of their front row seats, and walk up to the board to see what was written on it.

<p><b>Weirdeyes</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2018, 19:06</p><p>Kelly </p><p> </p><p>I didnt have to deal with a super bad blur, but I did and still do deal with uncomfortable vision. When I was nine years old I noticed there was something off about my vision. I didnt know exactly what, but I suspected I needed glasses. When I got my eyes tested I didnt end up needing glasses. Two years later I did get glasses, but I had no prescription in my right eye and +1.25 in my left eye. I was surprised I supposedly only had bad vision in one eye and that Im farsighted. I remember having a bit of issues with distance vision. Eventually those glasses felt too weak, but my glasses werent getting much stronger. I also noticed issues with fine details like threading needles. Eventually the prescription in my left eye jumped up way higher, but the right eye stayed close to zero. Right now I still have a weak prescription in my right eye and a strong-ish one in my left eye. I struggle a lot with eye strain, but at least my astigmatism is corrected properly so I can see pretty well in the distance with my glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kelly</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2018, 17:39</p><p>I thought I would share my store here.  If you don't believe me, that is your personal choice.  I have no reason to tell such a humiliating story.  Yes as I said my teachers and friends did try to help me out.  Teachers would let me sit in the front of the class and often sent me to the nurse for eye exams.  Of course I failed more and more lines over the years, and the nurse would send home letters to my parents.  Some of my girlfriends would let me borrow their glasses for some classes.  I was always so amazed how different the world looked through their glasses.   </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But my parents always told me they could not afford glasses and I had to deal with it.  I think there was another reason too because my mother grew up needing glasses for a very long time and she always told me she learned how to live with bad eyes and I could do it too.  I really did try my best to do that because I felt like she was counting on me.  Many times I would pretend to see things that I could not see so she that would not realize how bad my eyes really were.  I started to feel like giving in and getting glasses would be admitting a personal failure.  So I struggled hard to see.  I thought when I was young that if I struggled hard enough I would always be able to see, but every year my eyes just got worse instead of better.  After a few years there were some things I could not see no matter how hard I squinted my eyes.    </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yes I know there are places where you can get cheap glasses.  But they didn't exist in my younger pre-glasses days.  I grew up in the 60s-70s and there were no cheap glasses options.  People who did not grow up during that time frame don't understand that healthcare access was not the same back then as it is now.  I think some people today might be surprised how many people need glasses but cannot find a way to afford them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Did anyone else here have to struggle through blur for a long time?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lou</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2018, 06:04</p><p>Hi Likelenses </p><p> </p><p>Re. Yes, even with low prescriptions the eyes become VERY used to the lenses. </p><p> </p><p>I completely agree. </p><p> </p><p>Best wishes </p><p> </p><p>Lou</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2018, 06:02</p><p>Hi Soundmanpt  </p><p> </p><p>Thanks very much.  Yes, I'm perfectly comfortable being a full-time glasses wearer.  Although I previously found my glasses useful for music, the computer, tv and driving, particularly long distance and at night, I found that once I'd worn them, I didn't like the slightly blurred vision I'd notice once I took them off, and would get also get eye strain.  I'd therefore not wear them at all some days when I was doing less visually demanding tasks, and on the days when I did wear them, I would then wear them for the rest of the day.  </p><p> </p><p>Since I was wearing my glasses all day quite a few days of the week anyhow, the switch to full-time has been easy, and nobody has really noticed any difference, since my orchestra colleagues are used to seeing me in glasses, and just probably didn't know that I previously didn't wear glasses on non orchestra days.  </p><p> </p><p>I am enjoying having good vision all the time, but even more, I'm enjoying no longer having intermittent inconsistent vision, particularly in the evenings, when I do a lot of night driving and orchestral concerts. </p><p> </p><p>Regarding, "I bet even in the pouring rain you missed not having your glasses on didn't you? Besides not seeing as well.", other than the slightly blurred vision, I wasn't really bothered. My only slight regret is that I don't also have a more subtle frame, as I chose my previous glasses before I started wearing them full-time. </p><p> </p><p>I have a three pairs of regular glasses (two are my previous prescription pairs re-glazed) and a pair of reactions.  They are all a similar style, plastic in a slightly shallower depth than some of the current styles. </p><p> </p><p>These are the pair I wear most: </p><p> </p><p>i.e. https://www.specsavers.co.uk/glasses/sdo-ashleigh?sku=30515192 </p><p> </p><p>I think that these bold plastic frames suit me, but I don't think that they would go with a nice dress for a social function. </p><p> </p><p>For smarter occasions, I tend to wear my reactions pair, because they have a slightly slimmer frame in plain black: </p><p> </p><p>https://www.specsavers.co.uk/glasses/kylie-10?sku=30520240 </p><p> </p><p>I previously have had semi-rimless frames, and think that these or even a rimless </p><p> </p><p>All the best </p><p> </p><p>Lou </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bensmith</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2018, 05:05</p><p>A nice little sighting. In the break room, two students were having lunch, neither wearing glasses. Suddenly the other stood up and walked to the recycling bins below the sink asking her friend if they were for rubbish. At the same time as her friend said "no", she hunched down to read the signs on the bins, getting quite close to them. When returning to the table, she quickly said something like "I can't read those" and her friend just said "yeah" and changed the subject. A while later, when they were about to leave, her friend said "the rubbish bins are over there" because of course the shortsighted girl hadn't been able to locate them and had just sat there not knowing what to do. Next to the rubbish bin, she again leaned closer to read what it said but didn't say anything about it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2018, 00:00</p><p>Lou </p><p> Yes, even with low prescriptions the eyes become VERY  used to the lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2018, 12:27</p><p>Lou </p><p>Like you know, your eyes haven't gotten any worse since you started wearing your glasses full time, they have just gotten used to seeing everything through your glasses. Like you know your prescription is really very weak but even a weak prescription is sure to make a difference when you wear your glasses all the time. That's exactly why your optometrists suggested that you wear wear your glasses full time so your eyes don't have the problem they were having with adjusting back and forth when you were only wearing your glasses part time.Look at this way, you wouldn't need glasses at all if you didn't notice a change without them now. Yes even though you could legally drive without your glasses because your eyes are so used to seeing with your glasses you are right to keep your glasses on when driving because there is no doubt you see better with your glasses than you do without them. Now if oyu were to stop wearing your glasses for a few days your eyes would again get used to not seeing with them and you would probably be fine without them. except for having the issues you were dealing with before return. but I think you're happy being a full time glasses wearer now and because you enjoy seeing everything perfectly with your glasses. I bet even in the pouring rain you missed not having yur glasses on didn't you?  Besides not seeing as well.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lou</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2018, 09:41</p><p>Hi </p><p> </p><p>As I said quite a few times, my prescription is very small: </p><p> </p><p>R: +0.50 Sph -0.50 Cyl Axis 92 </p><p>L: +0.25 Sph -0.25 Cyl Axis 85 </p><p> </p><p>My prescription was the same in 2012, went up to +0.75 Sph -0.75 Cyl and +0.50 Sph and -0.50 Cyl in between, and then down again. </p><p> </p><p>As I said on one of the other threads, although my prescription had gone down, my eye strain had gone up, and I was sometimes having difficulty with my eyes relaxing sufficiently when I put my glasses on later in the day, when my eyes were already strained. </p><p> </p><p>In June, my optician recommended wearing my glasses full-time, to stop this cycle of over accommodating without my glasses, and then finding it difficult to fully relax my eyes when I put my glasses on. </p><p> </p><p>I took her advice of putting my glasses on as soon as I wake, and keeping them on all day, and it has solved all my issues. </p><p> </p><p>Since I am wearing my glasses other than in the shower, I don't really see what my uncorrected vision is like, at any distance other than the shower. </p><p> </p><p>Today, my parents visited, and I went with them to walk their dog.  It absolutely poured, and I eventually took my glasses off, owing to them misting up and not clearing. </p><p> </p><p>I reckon that I walked around a mile home, and I was pretty shocked what my uncorrected distance vision is like, especially since my prescription is so small.  </p><p> </p><p>Although I can legally drive without glasses, I don't think I'd want to. </p><p> </p><p>I don't think that my vision has really changed, since I can still see well with my glasses, but it definitely seems worse than I remember. </p><p> </p><p>All the best </p><p> </p><p>Lou</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2018, 07:16</p><p>Re: Kellys story </p><p> </p><p>Is this story true, or just a story? </p><p> </p><p>I cannot believe that. In many European countries, glasses for children are provided by Social Security structures, and vision test are in Kindergartens and schools. In the US, Zenni sells glasses for 6.95$, the price of three hamburgers or two packs of cigarettes. No teacher, or community employee or parent of school mates saw this problem and could help out? A child - left alone by the parents, the greater family (a greater family might be non-existent), the teachers, the community?  </p><p> </p><p>A sad, sad story - and I do hope it is not real, that it is a fake story! But my fear is, the story is true.  </p><p> </p><p>So, every story needs a good outcome: and here the outcome is, let us all keep our eyes (and our hearts, and our money bags) wide, wide open, that stories like this don't repeat!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2018, 20:13</p><p>Kelly </p><p> What is your prescription now, and how old are you?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kelly</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2018, 16:58</p><p>I grew up in a poor family that could not always afford health care.  I started noticing blurriness when I was in about second grade.  My parents could not afford glasses and my eyes got worse every year.  There were things I could see one year but next year they were blurry.  The teachers knew my eyes were bad so they tried to help.  Sometimes in school friends would let me borrow their glasses for a class because they knew how bad I couldn't see and felt sorry for me.  I think it was junior high school when I finally got glasses.  By that time I couldn't recognize people fifteen feet away.  The eye doctor said I had a very high prescription for getting my first glasses and told me if I got glasses sooner maybe my eyes would not be so bad.  It was truly a different world for me with glasses.  Every single thing in my life changed.  I would call myself almost blind.  But there was nothing I could do.  Sometimes you grow up in a family and situation where you just have to learn to live with really bad eyes.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Paul in Chi town</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2018, 16:05</p><p>Adam..I was prescribed -0.75 for distance and sparingly wore them, mostly for night driving. I think my distance vision was mostly good, and didn't really need them during the day. I decided to try them during the day for about a week, and noticed a distinct blur when I took them off that certainly wasn't there before I put them on. Because I can see clearly with the glasses on, I interpret that as meaning my "acuity" did not get worse (if it did then the glasses would no longer be "strong" enough) but that visual processing changed as my brain got used to them. So I conclude that while wearing the glasses did not make my vision worse, I unfortunately am becoming more dependent on them for clear distance vision. I have to have a vision screening for my DL, and expect a restriction that I likely wouldn't have gotten if I didn't wear the glasses so often.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adam</b>&nbsp;21 Feb 2018, 12:48</p><p>NNVisitor </p><p>Of course, the biggest reason is genetics but I think straining your eyes and squinting without glasses can make eyes worse, or at least make them tired and red.  </p><p>About the other part of your comment, I think the ones who are starting to wear glasses will be uncomfortable without glasses earlier than their eyes get worse, it is just about 2 months. If I imagine a more severe situation that someone's eyes are worsening 1,5 diopters a year, it is just 0,25 diopters in 2 months, it is nothing (okay, I know it is not totally linear but I think it's a good example).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NNVisitor</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2018, 23:28</p><p>Wearing or not wearing glasses won't stop our eyesight from getting worse. People who wear glasses have seen their eyes get worse and worse. People who limit their glasses wear as well and people who don't wear glasses when prescribed. Close work and long hours of studying or reading may make our eyesight worse. That's why it's good to take breaks from continuous close work or reading and focus on things far away.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adam</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2018, 12:56</p><p>It is quite hard to tell what is the truth but I don't agree with those who say that wearing glasses will make your eyes worse. On the other hand, and that can be the reason of that theory, someone who starts to wear glasses will be uncomfortable without glasses even within 1-2 months. But I think the reason is that they get used to good vision and they will feel their original vision bad. </p><p> </p><p>By the way, I love to see girls squinting and struggling to see, it is strange even for me to accept it, but for me it is a big fetish.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2018, 09:40</p><p>Tom </p><p>I completely agree with you. Eyesight is most often determined by the genes that you receive at birth. Then vision continues to change due to growth. Most people's growth doesn't stop until their in their early to mid twenties. So by holding off form getting glasses when you first need them isn't going to change anything. So instead of getting glasses early when they are first needed at say -.50 or -.75 holding off for 2 years would maybe result in then needing -1.25 or -1.50 glasses. The very same result would happen if that person got their glasses when they first needed them at -.50 or -.75. In other words not getting glasses early on wouldn't change anything in regards to making your eyesight worse and getting glasses and wearing them would yield the same result.  </p><p>So if your girlfriend would have gone to full time wear when she was 18 instead of only wearing her glasses to see the board, drive and at the movies her eyes would changed the exact same way as they did. I always find it amusing when someone tells me that they try to wear their glasses too much because they don't want to become dependent.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2018, 00:47</p><p>Adam </p><p> </p><p>I do not agree with anonymous. </p><p> </p><p>I'd say most people experience their worst prescription increases between 12 and 20y of age, and such has not much to do with wearing their glasses. A girlfriend I had started college at 18y needing glasses only to see the blackboard, drive her car, and go to the movies. But 4y later she had become fully dependent on specs, and she put them on first thing in the morning. I remember her telling me once that her prescription increased by 1 to 1.5 diopter per year. Even though she had always tried to wear them only when strictly needed.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2018, 20:13</p><p>wearing glasses actually makes your eyes worse.  she would not have eyes so bad now if she never got them in the first place. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adam</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2018, 13:53</p><p>This story is about a girl who was my classmate and refused to wear her glasses for 3 years but became dependent on glasses then. </p><p>She started squinting when she was 11 years old. A bit later she got -0,5 glasses. She almost never wore them, she was squinting to see the board instead. As time has passed, it seemed obvious that she is not comfortable without glasses but didn't want to use them.  </p><p>After three years of squinting during the lessons, she became a fully glasses wearer. Her eyes worsened and maybe she admitted that she needs them. She got totally used to her glasses in some month. She took them off only during PE classes and it became more obvious that she needs to wear glasses, her eyes were always squinty without them. I think this prescription was about -1,5. At the swimming pool she started to struggle realizing us, her vision started to be poorer. </p><p>After some months, she swiched to contacts but once I have heard a talk about her eyes. It was two years after she started wearing glasses full time. She said that her left eye is -3 and her right eye is -2,75.  </p><p>I don't know the reason why her eyes became worse quite fast but it is maybe because she refused to wear her glasses for three years. What do you think of it? We haven't met for years but I saw a picture about her wearing glasses and her eyes became worse than the last time I saw her.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lou</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2018, 10:27</p><p>Hi again Austin </p><p> </p><p>Sorry, I meant to add that I don't really know whether contact lenses would be a better choice for your wife. Probably multi focal contact lenses would give her worse vision than with glasses, and since she is happy to go without her glasses in the house, she probably sees no need for contact lenses.  I suppose it would depend on her individual reason for taking off her glasses.  If she is fed up with wearing glasses but wishes that her vision was a little sharper without, maybe multi focal contact lenses or mono vision with contact lenses would be worth a try. </p><p> </p><p>Best wishes </p><p> </p><p>Lou</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lou</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2018, 10:21</p><p>Hi Austin </p><p> </p><p>Re.: Thanks yet again Lou. Am I right in understanding that for most of her close work, her vision is not as clear as with glasses and that she simply finds it easier to go without glasses rather than putting them on and off regularly? Would contacts be a better option? </p><p> </p><p>You are again very welcome. </p><p> </p><p>If you add your wife's near add to her distance prescription, her reading prescription is: </p><p> </p><p>-0.25 / -1.00 x 100 and -0.75 / -0.75 x 95  </p><p> </p><p>Her vision is at its worst in the distance, and gradually improves with closer distances, until it is at its best close up. </p><p> </p><p>Her -1.00 x 100 and -0.75 x 95 cylinder values suggest that she has significant (this is probably subjective, but astigmatism probably starts becoming a nuisance for most people around the 0.75 mark) astigmatism, which will distort/blur her vision at all distances </p><p> </p><p>Regarding the sphere values on your wife's prescription, when you add her +2.00 reading add to her distance prescription, as shown above, she only needs -0.25 and -0.75 respectively for her right and left eyes for close work.  Therefore considering her sphere values alone, since they remain negative numbers, taking off her glasses, is equivalent to someone with no refractive error putting on +0.25 and +0.75 respectively reading glasses.  I would have thought that this would have been offset with her -1.00 and -0.75 respectively uncorrected cylinder, but things are further complicated by her choice of reading distance.  If she prefers to read closer than what the optician presumed, her reading add requirement could be +2.50, which would alter her reading prescription to: </p><p> </p><p>+0.25 / -1.00 x 100 and -0.25 / -0.75 x 95 </p><p> </p><p>As you can see now, the sphere values are getting very low, and since astigmatism often has a greater effect in the distance than at near (I have a small amount of long-sighted astigmatism, so you would think that it would effect me more at near, but in reality, I find my vision more blurred at intermediate and far distances than at near), maybe she can see so similarly at near, that after forty years of glasses, she is enjoying being able to manage without glasses around the house.  I just don't know.  My guess is that now that he is older and needs a +2.00 reading addition, that she can now see well enough at near and intermediate to manage without glasses, and it is her choice to only wear them for distances rather than full-time, simply because this has become a possibility for her as her reading add has increased with age. </p><p> </p><p>I hope that this will be of some help. </p><p> </p><p>Best wishes </p><p> </p><p>Lou    </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lou</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2018, 05:41</p><p>Hi Austin </p><p> </p><p>You are very welcome.  Thank you very much for the clarification that she does wear multi focals. </p><p> </p><p>Regarding how well she sees, I'm sorry but I can't really answer that. </p><p> </p><p>Since her near add is the same as my husband, I'm guessing that the intermediate section of her multi focals probably equates to the +1.25 intermediate add he has for his separate computer glasses. </p><p> </p><p>If you add this to her current script, it comes out as, -1.00/-1.00 x 100 and -1.50/-0.75 x 95 </p><p> </p><p>I'm not sure about the size of your table, but I would have thought that sitting opposite someone at dinner would be a greater distance than that used for viewing a computer. </p><p> </p><p>On paper, I would have thought that she would see you as slightly blurred, but she obviously feels that she can see well enough, or she wouldn't keep taking off her glasses. </p><p> </p><p>And no, since her near add will probably increase a little yet to +2.50 or maybe even +3.00, depending on how close she likes to read, I wouldn't have thought that she would become more reliant on glasses again. </p><p> </p><p>I hope that this will help.  Having only a small amount of long-sighted astigmatism myself, I have no idea how well someone with myopia and astigmatism sees. </p><p> </p><p>Take care </p><p> </p><p>Lou</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Austin</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2018, 04:41</p><p>Thanks for the info Lou.    She does wear multi focals.     So how well does she see?   Am I blurred to her when she sits opposite me at dinner? Is she likely to become reliant on glasses again? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lou</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2018, 03:34</p><p>Hi Austin </p><p> </p><p>I believe that the explanation is her age and near add of +2.00.  My husband is 59, so not that different in age to your wife, and also has a near add of +2.00. Owing to his age, he also needs an intermediate addition, and his is +1.25.  If your wife had an intermediate addition on her prescription, it would likely be much the same as that of my husband. Since he is a lot more near sighted than your wife, he wears varifocals all the time, taking them off only to read.  I'm not sure whether your wife has varifocals, but if she has separate or only distance glasses, since her near prescription cancels out a lot of her distance prescription, she probably finds that she can see better without them near and intermediate, which is why she only puts them on to watch telly in the house.  Even if your wife wears varifocals, maybe she finds that she can see almost as well without them within the relatively close distances within the house, so doesn't bother to wear them. </p><p> </p><p>My father in law whose near sighted distance prescription is a lot lower than my husband's and only has distance glasses, has started taking his glasses off in the house over recent years, just wearing them for driving and when out and about.  I believe it for the reasons which I suggest above. </p><p> </p><p>I hope that this will help </p><p> </p><p>Best wishes </p><p> </p><p>Lou</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Austin</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2018, 03:02</p><p>My wife, aged 62 has worn glasses for over 40 years until about a year ago.   Since then she rarely wears them inside unless watching tv.    Out side and when driving she wears sunglasses other than at night when she reverts to glasses.   She also rarely wears them at restaurants and when eating meals.  Her current script is -2.25 / -1.00 x 100 and an add of 2.00 and -2.75 / -0.75 x 95 with an add of 2.00.    She started taking her glasses off to read and then extended the time without them to the point today where she rarely wears them.   Is this usual?    How well does she see without them?  Any thoughts as to how to convince her to return to wearing them?  She does squint on occasions but surprisingly not very often. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2017, 21:35</p><p>Tobias, </p><p>Vision occurs in the brain.  The eyes are merely biological cameras.  The brain has amazing ability to generate images with poor input, IF it know what something is supposed to look line. In fact it can generate images with NO input at all.  Ever had a dream? </p><p>Everyone is different.  Some people are better at functioning without vision correction than others.  You have no way of knowing what your gf perceives without her glasses.  A description of her prescription as being in the -6 range is not very helpful.  She could have significant astigmatism that makes her vision worse than yours without any astigmatism, we just don't have enough information to make a reasonable judgement. </p><p>Do you know how to check a lens for a Cylinder component? </p><p>If there is no astigmatism involved in her glasses, her ability to function could be related to the visual environment.  If you are in a familiar environment and she is not very familiar with that environment, functioning without vision correction could be a big part of the problem. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Weirdeyes</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2017, 16:50</p><p>Tobias </p><p> </p><p>I'm not myopic, but I definitely notice a lot of variation between how people describe their vision vs their prescription. My prescription is R +1.00, -0.75 L +4.25, -1.50. I've noticed a lot of people with a similar prescription to me describe themselves as blind without glasses. A lot of them don't even have astigmatism. I don't think I'm blind without glasses. Especially because my right eye prescription is so mild. I don't have the best depth perception, but I have no trouble showering and doing regular everyday tasks without glasses. I think my brain has adapted pretty well to my lack of depth perception, so I don't bump into stuff or have trouble grabbing stuff. My vision does get pretty wonky if I go without glasses for too long, so I do wear them most of the time. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tobias</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2017, 13:52</p><p>I am 35 yo male wearing R -8.5 L -8.25 glasses (no astigmatism). Since I am the only one in my family and my circle of friends with strong-ish myopia, I was really surprised to learn that my new gf (with rx in -6 range) literally cannot function without her glasses at all, while I can put them on in the morning only to check my facebook account (rather uncomfortable to look at my phone from 5cm) and than obviously to leave the apartment. How come she needs her glasses more than I do? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2017, 13:27</p><p>sylvestria </p><p>Sadly you're a bad position because your agent is from the "old school of thought about glasses" it used to be that if being a model or an actress you either wore contacts or you struggled without your glasses. But glasses have become much more popular now for models as well as actresses to wear modeling and on screen. You need to sit down with your agent and tell him that you really can't function very well without glasses anymore. It sounds like it would be unsafe for you to do any type of runway modeling if you're unable to see you could fall off the runway and get badly injured. Have him try and get you modeling jobs with eyeglass companies if possible. That way you could even get your own glasses and be borrowing glasses from a friend anymore.  But even modeling other things such as clothes wearing glasses should be accepted by many companies these days.   </p><p></p><hr>

I try for contacts but say me eyes dry and cannot.  I sneak and get glasses because world much blurry.  Cannot recognize people. Me eyes see things not real.  I get close to see but things not what I think.  I wear glasses private, but no public. Me eyes feel better much but glasses heavy so when shoot, I cannot.  So I do not bring.  I function but people far I cannot.  agent thinks me eyes pretty and say glasses ruin sexy image.  I want to post here because I want convince that wear glasses during shoot.  Some shoots very bad because studio blurry.  Camera see I cannot well.  I think me eyes look lost in photos but agent believe it is a good look.  agent tell me stop squinting hard.

<p><b>Apple77</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2017, 18:46</p><p>Here's a rather elaborate blog about going without glasses: </p><p> </p><p>https://ladyagda.wordpress.com/category/going-without-glasses/</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bensmith</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2017, 06:04</p><p>An interesting little discussion about going without glasses with high myopia: </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-live-with-high-myopia-more-than-6-00-degrees-without-glasses#!n=12" target="_blank">http://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-live-with-high-myopia-more-than-6-00-degrees-without-glasses#!n=12</a> </p><p> </p><p>I personally do not know anyone anymore who would wear their glasses/contacts only part of the time. A while ago my girlfriend encountered a friend of hers in a fitness class and said that the friend didn't say hello "even though we were like next to each other". My girlfriend thought that maybe it was because her friend wasn't wearing her glasses. I wonder how blurry the instructor must have been if she couldn't recognize people even six feet away. </p><p> </p><p>So I guess it happens, some people choose to go bareeyed in some circumstances.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NNVisitor</b>&nbsp;17 Apr 2017, 13:36</p><p>T </p><p> </p><p>Miracles do happen. Your mother is a very lucky person. While my prescription is -10 I have quite a bit of astigmatism as well and I can tell you how headlights looked to me at night without my contacts or glasses. Both streetlights and vehicle headlights appeared as huge kaleidascope fragments. Things were incredibly blurred worse than it would be during the day.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;17 Apr 2017, 12:14</p><p>T; you mentioned you can't imagine what you mother's uncorrected vision might be like. If you are curious, you can gain an approximation of that by being bare-eyed yourself and then adding some drugstore reading glasses in the highest Rx you can get, usually +3 or slightly higher. That would give you a rough approximation about how your </p><p>Mom might see without correction.  Again, best wishes for a good recovery for her and thanks for sharing her story and what can happen if someone unpredictably and suddenly is without their glasses, especially with higher Rxs.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>T</b>&nbsp;17 Apr 2017, 01:52</p><p>Thanks GreginColo, that's nice of you to say. She is fine, only a bit bruised up. I'm around -7 last time I checked, mum is -11.75 on her contacts. I feel blind as a bat with my vision and I don't think I'd feel safe crossing a street without visual aids. I can't even imagine what she sees at that level of nearsightedness.  </p><p> </p><p>She normally wears contact lenses and can't help but think that this could've been avoided had she worn them instead of her glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2017, 19:35</p><p>T: thanks for sharing the story about your Mom; hopefully she is doing ok, physically and emotionally. Its good she had her friend there to help guide her to safety. It amazing how life can change in a split second, but hopefully this will soon be just a bad memory for her, but also a lesson to the rest of us, that its difficult to imagine what and how others are seeing, or not seeing, feeling, hearing, etc.  Thanks for this post as a reminder.  If you don;t mind me asking, what is your own Rx in relation to hers?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>T</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2017, 09:49</p><p>This thread reminded me of what happened to my mother. </p><p> </p><p>A few weeks ago, my mother was driving at night and got T-boned crossing an intersection- her car spun and ended up facing on coming traffic. In the crash, her glasses flew off her face. She needed to get out of the car quickly to avoid being struck head on by the traffic but there was no way she could safely cross the road because she couldn't see the cars that were coming towards her (she said she could see the headlights but couldn't see enough to make a judgment on how far away they were/how fast they were approaching. Luckily her friend  was there with her and found her glasses (turns out they were broken to the point they were unwearable) who helped her cross the road safely. </p><p> </p><p>I wear glasses too although my eyes are not as bad as her so I can imagine what she went through. If she was alone, she would be in real trouble. I don't think people without nearsightedness like ours realise how difficult and scary it can be to live with it!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2017, 09:35</p><p>Jenny </p><p>I'm surprised that you never asked her why she enjoyed wearing your glasses so much? I think she clearly must have liked the way your glasses felt to wear. And she probably liked how she looked wearing your glasses. When she first put your glasses on things were probably blurry but after she had the on for a little while her eyes adjusted to them and she would have been able to see nearly perfect with them on. It's possible since she was apparently a good friend to you that was her way of telling you that you're wearing glasses wasn't a big deal. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jenny</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2017, 18:48</p><p>Nah, even 6 years later her eyes are good. I think she did like the way they looked on her though, or maybe she thought everything looked trippy or something. My eyesight has always been pretty bad, but not to the extent where I felt completely helpless. I never really thought anything weird about it. Honestly I was always flattered that she liked them so much. </p><p> </p><p>My sister's eyesight is much worse than mine though. I remember one time she had to call me into her room because she lost her glasses and couldn't see them (they were on her dresser right in front of her).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>antonio</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2017, 11:42</p><p>Interesting story, Jenny, how strong Were your glasses that time, do you remember, in high school? </p><p>Best regards , antonio</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2017, 08:54</p><p>Jenny </p><p>That seems to be a big thing between girls. In most cases the friend likes how you look wearing glasses and she is curious how she looks wearing your glasses. But your friend Lisa was clearly far more fascinated with your glasses than you would expect. Do you think she possibly found that she was able to see better with your glasses? If your glasses weren't very strong that could very well have been why she didn't want to return them. If you had any older glasses that was of no use to you anymore you could have given them to her. I have a feeling she would have gladly accepted. I have seen several cases where a friend will often wear her friends glasses when they are out together. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jenny</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2017, 01:59</p><p>We've all had that one friend who always needs to try on our glasses. For me that was my friend Lisa. I love the girl, but when we were in high school she always wanted to wear my glasses when we'd hang out. I remember one time I was at a sleepover party with her and a few other friends. She wanted to try on my glasses for a selfie and then literally would not give them back to me until the next day. Even wen we all went to bed she took them off and put them next to the table as if the were her glasses! The next day she put them on (once again as if they were hers) but then gave them back about an hour later. I honestly didn't mind too much, but still I sometimes had to remind her that I kind of need those to see.</p><p></p><hr>

My friend was one of 3 sisters, her Father Irish &amp; Mother  Lebonese. A familar story trying to read the board at school &amp; could not. It was only after the school threatened to take the parents to court for child cruelty was when she gor her first glasses at 11. Now schools do regular eye tests &amp; locally they are very hot on it &amp; so thats why so many wear glasses now &amp; of course they are now "Cool"A lot of plussies are about &amp; not so much myopic squinting either. In her case she met in a pub a guy with glasses too, more myopic than her , they hadsex &amp; then there was a wedding.So she had several years of full time wear &amp; it is when you suddenly have no glasses the blur seems worse. She is about -5 now &amp; her husband -7. Glasses are not a problem as she has beeen the local mayoress.Are there any strong plussies who have been bare eyed?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2017, 10:15</p><p>varifocals </p><p>For any bride to be if she wears glasses often becomes a topic of discussion. If you look about you will find places where a woman asks if she should or shouldn't wear her glasses at her wedding? Of course only the bride and possibly the groom should answer. But she will ask the question I assume to see what other glasses wearing women did on their wedding day. So what I found of interest, even though I am a single man and have never been married, was the replies that were given. There was no clear choice. Some said that weren't yet married said that they intended to wear wear glasses on their wedding day because that how everyone has come to know her and they probably wouldn't even recognize her without her glasses and said that they would have to wear their glasses because without them they couldn't see well enough to walk down the isle. And some of these same ladies said that they might get new glasses that would go better with their wedding dress. Some said they would learn to wear contacts for that day. A few said that they hadn't been wearing glasses all that long and that they could still see well enough without their glasses so they planned on going without glasses for that day. Many could see a problem down the road when they would look back at their wedding pictures and she would be wearing dated glasses that were many years out of style. And just as you brought up many of the mothers entered into it by trying to convince their daughters to not wear glasses at their wedding. I found this most interesting because in the past mothers always seemed reluctant about their daughters starting to need glasses because they feared that that by wearing glasses it would ruin her looks and she would never find a man. But that seemed to have gone away and mothers were much more accepting their daughters need for glasses. But it seems to still pop up on the daughters biggest day of her life. I forgot to mention that some had pictures taken with and without glasses. It was interesting gto see all the different opinions and reasons. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>varifocals</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2017, 09:06</p><p>I found your comments on going without glasses interesting. Now of course glasses are more acceptable &amp; I wonder why people endure the suffering. I am long sighted so my distance vision is not too bad. I did suffer with cronic headaches &amp; it was only after an eye test  I was told I was long sighted &amp; now wear full time. I did try a bit without them &amp; the cronic headaches returned. I have a friend locally who rose to be the local Mayoress. She always wears glasses now. She has 2 sisters who have perfect vision but was always made to feel the odd one by her family. She met this fellow myopic in a pub &amp; they had  sex then the bump! </p><p>There was a hurried catholic wedding &amp; her mother nagged her not to wear her glasses to show off her nice almond shaped eyes. When she got into the car she saw the blur &amp; of course nothing to help. her husband saw her comming down the aisle squinting like mad. He had a big row with her </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adam</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2016, 22:41</p><p>I have a story about a girl who is one of my formers classmates. The story is about from 8-year-old until now (24-yrs-old). If you would like more stories like that, I can write more, I have some stories about girls going without glasses.  </p><p>I realised at the first time she has unique shape of eyes which means a bit like Asian. I liked her eyes but her vision was okay until 11-yrs-old. </p><p>That was the time when I realized she is a bit cross-eyed and she was always complaining about her vision. The interesting thing is that I can"t remember any squintings. The other thing I realized is that she looked very cross-eyed when looking at near. About a month later than I realized these things, she got a -1 glasses.  </p><p>As months were gone, her eyes looked straining more and more when she took off her glasses. I think that was because of accomodations. But squinting didn't come. About a year after she got her first glasses, I was in the swimming pool with her (without her glasses). We were in the buffet when she said she hardly can see the menu on the wall (but also can't remember squinting). </p><p>A bit later she got -2 glasses and after that she always told me that she can't see without her glasses.  </p><p>She had that glasses for about 3 years. During these years she was squinting very hard without glasses (finally). During the last months she started squinting very hard even with glasses. We were 15-yrs old at that time so that was more and more exciting for me (and that was the start of my 'squinting fetish"). Besides that, her very cross-eyed look at near distance remained.  </p><p>After that she got a -2,5 glasses. She had these glasses for about 4 years. During that time her squinting without glasses became worse and worse and even with glasses her eyes were a little bit squinting.  </p><p>We haven't met too often during the last 5 years, but I know that her eyes are about -3 now and her slightly crossed eyes are the same. And her lower eyelids also show that she was squinting also during the last some years.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myla</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2016, 14:24</p><p>Neesa Jane </p><p> </p><p>I think you should just start wearing the glasses all the time. I don't know how long ago you bullied those girls about their glasses, but there's a chance some of them have gotten over it. Just be prepared to be the geek with thick glasses for awhile. If they get broken, just tape them back together if you can and get by until you can get a new pair. You could also try wearing a strap to help prevent them from getting snatched off your face. You can't undo the past, you can only endure the consequences of your choices, then move forward. School doesn't last forever anyway - one day, you will never have to see your classmates again. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2016, 17:05</p><p>I am a forgiving type of person and I would feel bad for Nessa Jane if she had only teased other girls about their need for glasses but taking their glasses away and then even worse yet breaking them was a terrible thing to do. She left those poor girls to struggle until they could get new glasses and in some cases i'm sure the cost of new glasses was a hardship on her parents. Honestly it isn't for me or others to judge her. But it seems that her judgement has come from above. Now Nessa Jane's eyesight seems to have gone from being good to quite bad in a rather short time. So now she sees what it's like when your eyes don't work so well anymore. But now for her she has to be concerned that once she starts wearing glasses things are sure to be even more blurry then it is now when she takes her glasses off. And she will be living in fear that someone she abused before will grab her glasses off her face and she may not even be able to see who the person is that has her glasses. If they decide to break her glasses it will be that much worse for her because she will be without glasses for at least several days. At some point though she is going to have to get glasses because it seems someone higher up is taking away her eyesight. </p><p></p><hr>

No one is there to force you to wear your glasses and as mean as you were to others maybe its justice that your eyesight is less than perfect now. You're right to be scared to be seen wearing glasses after all the grief you gave others. That has to be a part of why you can't bring yourself to start wearing your glasses and instead you're going around only seeing everything in a blur now. Trust me your glasses hasn't ruined your eyes Your eyesight was already ruined before you ever got your glasses and you know it. Oh yes i'm sure now that you have glasses and when you do seek around your house wearing them you have to be amazed at how well you can see. But I don't blame yo for not wanting to walk out of your house wearing glasses. You be seen by one of those that you were mean to about wearing glasses. That sure wouldn't be good for you now would it? At some point like it or not your not going to be able to go outside without your glasses becasue your eyesight is almost certain to continue to get worse. As far as i'm concerned i don't care if you ever wear your glasses. But i do hope that you don't hit by that car that you can't see coming down the road.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

I think, though, once you find out that wearing your glasses in class will turn out to be a much smaller deal than you think, you might keep them on. </p><p> </p><p>I refused to wear my glasses full-time for years even though I needed to.

You can wear your glasses as much or as little as you want. </p><p> </p><p>Second, the glasses are not ruining your eyes. What has happened is that your eye muscles were working harder than necessary to accommodate your vision issues. Now that you have glasses, the muscles have relaxed to the point that your vision is now what it actually is.   </p><p> </p><p>It appears that you are realizing you need to wear glasses all the time, though that ultimately is up to you.  It all depends on how much blur you can stand. Your comments suggest that the blur is too much to function with.   </p><p> </p><p>Neesa Jane, your present eyesight without glasses is as good as it is going to be.  Is that good enough for you? Or, would you rather see clearly even if it means you have a day or two of feeling self-conscious? </p><p> </p><p>I think you know the answer.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>neesa jane</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2016, 21:13</p><p>i've got glasses now.  it sucks.  i don't wear them often because they look thick and i get dizzy wearing them.  i had gotten them about two weeks ago, but i still can't bring myself to wearing them outside my house.  in my bedroom like now i need them badly to work on my laptop.  my mother keeps sayiing i need to wear them and sometimes makes me wear them at home.  but she doesn't believe me when i say i don't need to wear them all the time.  but you know why she does not believe me.  it gets hard faking it.  the house has become so blurry with my glasses off now.  i think they ruined my eyesight and i avoid wearing them as much as possible.  if i wear them a long time watching netflix with my parents, i get dizzy as hell wihtout them.  many times i will sit in blur watching tv because i don't want them to know how bad my eyes really are.  but at school my eyes really suck now.  probably because the glasses ruining my eyes.</p><p></p><hr>

But I am quite certain any doctor worth his or her salt can easily determine when someone is faking an eye exam. So I probably shouldn't have said "without a doubt" when I suggested how a doctor might handle the situation. I should have said that "in my opinion" this is what could happen. Bianca isn't the first one I have heard this same thing from. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;12 Dec 2016, 10:37</p><p>Bianca </p><p> </p><p>I found your story very interesting and I can relate to it.  The fact that you were so fascinated by glasses that you wore them secretly at 40 when you still didn't need them and now at 52, when you do need them, you can't still wear them in public because you feel it's wrong to wear them, as if there was something "tainted" about them. </p><p> </p><p>May I ask you? Was there a sexual element when you used to wear them secretly? That would explain the feeling of  wearing glasses being "something wrong". </p><p> </p><p>I'm very curious, as normally (from what I've read in previous posts in this website) the sexual element with  glasses fetishism is something only experienced by men. But from my experience of years observing how women relate to glasses, I'm not at all persuaded that women can't experience that sexual element too. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Dec 2016, 08:48</p><p>Bianca </p><p>I would bet that the doctor knew very quickly that you really didn't need glasses and were only trying to be prescribed glasses. Without a doubt some doctors will then proceed to write you a prescription anyway and they will intentionally make it something that is too strong for you to wear comfortabllity knowing that you won't come back complaining about your glasses since you lied. I have seen this happen in quite a few people. I think the doctor does that because they feel like you're wasting their time. Of course he really could have been nice and simply wrote you a weak prescription that you would have had no trouble adjusting to since you wanted to wear glasses. But had he done that with you being still rather young the glasses would have likely ruined your eyesight and he didn't want to knowingly ruin your eyesight.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Dec 2016, 08:35</p><p>Fuax Myope </p><p>For years I have been telling people that trying to fool the optometrist by faking that you can't see the ey chart really doesn't work. But it is very easy to come awy with a small prescription for glasses by simply doing what you did. Claiming that you have trouble seeing at night when driving always works . You didn't say but I am almost certain that the prescription you received fo glasses was -.50 for both eyes as well as getting an AR coating (anti-reflective) put on your lenses. Nearly every doctor I know uses this when they have a patient thatis perfectly able to see the 20/20 line on the eye chart but has this type of complaint. As you know it is a very weak prescription but even being weak they still make a difference to your vision. I'm sure after you have wore your glasses for several hours when you take them off things are slightly more blurry without them.  </p><p>Now of course if you just want to wear glasse with a prescription you can go to quite a few on line retailers that will make glasses for you in any prescription you want without any questions being asked. </p><p></p><hr>

At 40 I was prescribed reading glasses and was too embarrassed to wear them. Now at 52 I am struggling without readers and am too embarrassed  to admit it.

<p><b></b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2016, 14:51</p><p>neesa jane </p><p>You do have to understand that it does seem very hard to believe that if you were taking as many glasses from so many girls that at some point it would seem that the parents of these girls would have come looking for you to pay for their daughters glasses that you snatched and broke. And if you did indeed do this to quite few girls even though you're now sorry that still doesn't make it all right. If your eyesight is failing you their isn't much you can do about it except yo continue to struggle without vision correction, get glasses or get contacts. Those are your options. If you decide to start wearing glasses you can only hope that none of those girls that you treated so badly by taking their glasses take your glasses from you.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>antonio</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2016, 11:19</p><p>Neesa Jane  </p><p> </p><p>According to your words that you can.t read any board now without the help  help of lenses you simply must put on some glasses or wear some contacts in your eyes, if you can stand them. Not all people can stand them because of dry eyes. If you choose or have to choose glasses I hope others aren.t that mean to snatch your glasses off your nose and not to give them back. If this ever happens here they are normally given back to you one or some hours later or next day at least. Is it different in your school? </p><p>If you choose contact lenses to wear you shouldn.t wear them all day long, and rest your eyes Sometimes without or behind some glasses. If you don.tgive them a rest might be there will be a day in some years you can.t  wear contacts any more and thus you have to wear glasses all the time. If you fear they take your glasses off, just wear a strap behind your head fixing them to your nose if you are now really in need of them to see </p><p> We can.t heal your eyes. Only God can.

I'm not sure how you could get so much enjoyment out taking other girls glasses d leaving them unable to see things clearly. Now that your own eyes are unable to see very well do you realize how unfunny it was to take away their glasses and even worse crush them? It would have been bad enough to take their glasses as a joke and after a few minutes of making fun of them without their glasses finally returning them. But you apparently didn't do that you broke them and left those poor girls without glasses until they could get new ones and then they were too scared to even wear their new glasses for fear of you taking them again. You really are a terrible person. You totally deserve to have your eyesight deteriorate to the point where you're completely unable to function without glasses. Then I hope you run into a bully that takes your glasses and leaves you nearly blind trying to find your way home. That would be justice for all those other girls that you took away their glasses. So if you continue to live in the same area you're pretty much screwed. And like you are finding out your eyesight isn't going to get any better, only worse. You may want to consider moving away.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sarah</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2016, 22:08</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p>Thank you for your suggestions. I will definitely decide on one of them. After whaf I am going through right now, I knkw how easily sonething can happen to glasses, and how extremly difficult it is for me to function without glasses. </p><p>Thank you </p><p>~Sarah</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sarah</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2016, 22:00</p><p>Likelenses, </p><p>First off, I do not undeestand why you think I would lie about this. Second, what does how long it will take to get new hearing aids have to do with anything? As far as my insurance, it is kids insurance. For the average kid it covers 2 glasses a year, but my eyesight has started changing so much, so fast (as apparent in the new glasses thread) that at my last appointment (a semi-annual one) my doctor decided to call the insurance company and say that in her opinion my vision has been changing a lot that by the end of a 6 month period my vision in my glasses is inadequate, and requested they allow me to get quartarly eye exams and new glasses. The company agreed, and now I have quartaly appointments.  As for my second pair of glasses, they are so old and weak they basically does not help. It is missing a lens and a quarter of the frame, so I am not wearing them. They broke sitting in a box if old things (a box I recntly found, which is why they are still with me, and not donated). I give my glasses to the place I get my glasses because they recycle them  and it helps people. Also, in 11 years of having glasses I have never broken a pair, cracked a lens, lost a pair, or gotten them stollen (untill now), so I just never thought I would need backups. The dicount is also a bonus. With the dicount I am able to get glasses above my insurances price limit if I want, or the place lets me save it up and they use it for someone who needs the little financial help; that is for when I choose a frame within my insurance's price limit.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2016, 20:40</p><p> I have my suspicions about Sarah's posts. </p><p> In the first post she said she had her hearing AIDS stolen also,and then in a later post said that it would take a long time for her to get her HEARING AID. </p><p> She also said her insurance pays for four pair of glasses a year.I have never even heard of an insurance plan that pays for more than one pair per year. </p><p> She stated a very high myopic script,and then talks about only having her second script.Most likely that script would be far to weak to even be of any help,and why would a high myope not keep a fairly recent pair of glasses.. </p><p> I think that she is putting us on,and has fashioned her story around my recent post about my Cheryl's recent episode with damaged glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2016, 08:51</p><p>Sarah, </p><p>With your prescription, you seriously need some back up glasses.  I have two suggestion for you to consider. </p><p>1. Skip donating the most recent glasses for one or two cycles.  What you want to have is your current glasses as backup, when you get new ones.  When you have a backup pair, you can resume donating the next-to-the-last pair for a discount. </p><p>2. Consider ordering an inexpensive backup pair of glasses from an online retailer, such as Zenni Optical.  With your prescription, three primary things determine the cost of the glasses.  1)The frame you select, 2) Your prescription, and 3) The lens material you choose.  I did a typical order using a US$9.95 frame, your prescription, and the lowest index lens.  I added the inexpensive Anti-Reflective coating and the total was about US$30.  Shipping can be very reasonable (US$5.00), but it depends on where you live.  You will need a Credit Card of some type and your PD. </p><p>Many of us have ordered glasses from Zenni and have been generally pleased with the quality and the price.  If you are interested and want some help ordering all you need to do is ask.  Typical delivery is about 2 weeks.  I recently helped an acquaintance, who needs +5.00 glasses, order a trial pair of backup glasses after his youngest child grabbed his glasses and bent the frame.  The glasses from Zenni, with a US$6.95 frame and the US$4.95 A/R coating totaled less than US$18.00.  He liked them so well that he decided to use his existing $$ glasses as the backup. </p><p>Let us know if we can help. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

I have my appointment in about a week. I can only get up to four glasses a year with my insurance and because of my higher prescription (the normal limit is 2).The four have to be 3 month apart, so I have to wait for the 14th.

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2016, 22:38</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p> Yeah, Cheryl had a really difficult time getting back to her car.Her lenses are very strong with a fair amount of cylinder,and a bifocal. </p><p> She really did not know which was the left or right lense,and holding them in the proper position for the cylinder,and bifocal made it all the worse.The left lense was warped from the sun ,so she was navigating with only one eye. </p><p> She sometimes likes to walk outside with me bare eyed.She loves me to put my arm around her,and guide her. She always comments that she can barely make out her feet,or any obstructions. She said that yesterday even though I was not there,and her vision was sort of in,and out of focus, that she had more confidence in her situation. </p><p> Yes, she is very diligent about always having a back up pair,and often two,one in her purse,and one in the glove compartment. </p><p> I think that if she had just put the glasses in her beach bag that they would have been OK. The frames are black,so out in the glaring sun for thirty minutes,or so really got them hot.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2016, 09:44</p><p>Likelenses </p><p>I'm sure Cheryl never even had any thought that leaving her glasses on her towel that they would actually melt. She must have been in a near panic when she saw the condition of her glasses? Then trying to make her way back to her car holding her lenses over her eyes so she could see where she was walking couldn't have been very easy either. Cheryl is very smart to keep a spare of glasses in her car glove box. I'm not sure how well she could have driven her car holding one lens in front of one eye and steering with the other hand. Everyone that wears glasses for driving really should have a spare pair in their cars glove box just for odd things like what happened to Cheryl. I've had several friends over the years that wished the had a spare pair in their glove box. As far back as when I was in my twenties the girl I was dating at the time went swimming at a public pool. She put her glasses in a storage box and when she returned to go home someone had stolen her glasses. She couldn't see well enough to drive home so she called me and I had to call a friend so we could go get her and her car back home. Recently a young I know ordered 2 pairs of glasses from me and during the time they were in route her daughter broke her glasses and when I came in a few days later with her new glasses she was thrilled to get her glasses. She told me that it was very hard for her to see to drive to and from work without her glasses. Her prescription was -1.50 if your wondering. Anyway really good that her glasses were under warranty are it would have been even worse for her if she would have had to buy new glasses. I know many people have had their glasses melt by leaving them on the dashboard of their car.  </p><p>Next time she wants to go swimming I wonder how she can protect her glasses so that doesn't happen again? What can she put her glasses in that won't get hot from the sun? I guess she could take an extra towel and wrap them in the towel. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2016, 19:42</p><p>Curious Joe, </p><p>It sounds like you may have some Exophoria, where you eyes want to diverge.  In very basic terms, Exo means that your eyes want to turn outward and phoria means that you can fuse the two images with effort and concentration.  There are typically only four possible ways to correct Exophoria: Do nothing and let your Eye Position Control System fuse the images, Exercises, Base In (BI) prism in glasses, or muscle surgery on the eye positioning muscles. </p><p>A few questions: </p><p>1.  What is your current complete prescription? </p><p>2. Do you wear Glasses, Contacts, or Both? </p><p>3. What is your age? </p><p>4. Where do you live? </p><p>5. Would you be interested in doing a simple prism test to measure the actual amount of Exophoria you have? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curious Joe</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2016, 13:51</p><p>So here's my curious past with swell higher iop ;-/, but not too high iop? </p><p>At one of my eye exam's in the past. (I needed new contact lenses, and was there initially to reorder more...During the end of my screening she brought in a box with a lens holder/lenses, and flipped them between my two eyes. After of which The Eye doctor per se stated with a deep mellow dramatic tone said to me "you have a squint!". Upon feeling startled I immediately replied to the contrary8-/...(So this was just a semi-comprehensive eye exam w/dialation I'd opted). Coincidentally after upon arrival home, and watching television... I noticed/felt my right eye begin to somewhat twitch, and my right eye drifted outwards a few times retracting, but staying turned out... A finite amount. But, Upon blinking I didn't think much of it. (A similar experience happened at an English H.S. Classroom while reading alone in the text book the sentences tho where literally ghosting/moving apart for which I had to blink to reoriente my eyes...never happened again that I canrecall. Tho upon reflecting on my experiences, and reading about Strabismus= Squint. Would I benefit from seeking out getting a "Prism(s) rx. Would I see things 3D, and be able to have my "squint" fully corrected? Sorry may I ask what the "experienced" ECP perhaps noticed in diagnosing, and would a squint call for prism lens route obviously be a less invasive route e.g. avoiding surgery at all costs 8-)? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2016, 14:29</p><p>Katie </p><p>Your experience being without your glasses was interesting and you did nothing wrong. You were smart to take your glasses off while you were laying on the sofa because even if you weren't planning falling asleep most times you do. And if still had you glasses on they easily could have gotten broke. Understandable that when you woke up and headed off to take a shower i'm sure you probably meant to pick your glasses up but just forgot them and as you said you wouldn't have wore them in the shower anyway. I'm sure that when you went back for them and found that they were gone you had to be in a bit of shock not finding them? I'm sure not being able to see very well when your probably used to wearing either your glasses or contacts full time must have been very difficult for you. But finding that your brother took them as a joke and forgot to return them I didn't see that coming. I was sure you were going to say that the family dog had taken them and whe you found them they were well chewed up. So I guess it was at least better that it was just your brother trying to be funny and your glasses were perfectly fine except for lots of fingerprints on the lenses. I know you said that you didn't have contacts or spare glasses. You didn't say if you were just out of contacts at the time or that you don't wear contacts at all? Anyway either way you probably really should get a spare pair of glasses. Don't you have any previous glasses that might be slightly weaker than you need now but would have been better than nothing? It is so easy to get yourself a nice pair of glasses on line and the cost is hardly anything. Check out (zennioptical.com) it is a very good site, the glasses are great looking and very good quality. You honestly will find more than 800 pairs of woman's glasses for under $13.00. You can even add on AR coating (anti-reflective) which is great to have on your glasses for $5.00 more. So nice glasses for around $18.00. I'm sure you wish you would have had a pair that day at school when you were without glasses. By the way did you want to kill your brother for that really funny joke?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katie</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2016, 13:47</p><p>I remember one time when I was about 17. I had taken off my glasses and fell asleep on the sofa, I probably set them on the table but I was really too tired to remember. I woke up about an hour later still feeling somewhat drowsy and decided to take a shower. I didn't really think to grab my glasses because obviously I don't wear them in the shower.  </p><p> </p><p>After I got out of the shower I went in my room and was about to do my homework only to realize how blurry everything was. I went back into the living room only to find that my glasses were no longer there. Panicking I began looking all over the house wondering if I had set them down somewhere without realizing (something I do fairly often) but they were nowhere to be found. The next day at school was horrible, I didn't have contacts or a spare so I had to go the whole day basically blind. It really sucked. </p><p> </p><p>When I got home that day I realized that I didn't look in my younger brother's room. I opened the door and sure enough there they were, on the floor! When I picked them up they were of course covered in his fingerprints. It felt so great being able to put them on again, finally I could actually see. I confronted him about it later that day and he just laughed and told me that he took them as a joke and forgot to give them back. From then on out I was much more careful about leaving them around in my house.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;03 May 2016, 08:48</p><p>Michael </p><p>Your right in that there has been very little change in your eyesight since 2014. Many optical shops now even though they have an optometrist operate as separate operations. So in a way it is more kike the doctor is just renting an office to work out of and has nothing to do with the glasses or contact part of the business. Now the problem is there are also a good number of optical shops that pay the doctor to be their and he / she gets paid as part of the store. So yes I have heard that in those cases doctors can be encouraged to prescribe glasses or to give a small increase in order to help sell glasses.  </p><p>As for Chris even though it is good that she is starting to wear her glasses more and more often which is exactly what your wanting and what she needs to be doing. But the downside is the more her eyes are slowly adjusting to her glasses it is without a doubt making it harder and harder for her to see very well when she still insists on taking them off and wearing her useless sunglasses. In other words her eyesight has to be even more blurry now when she isn't wearing her glasses which explains why she is needing to wear them more often. Kind of like a double edge sword. Have you suggested that she should maybe try wearing her glasses for driving now that she is getting more used to her glasses? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;02 May 2016, 15:16</p><p>Soundmanpt- Yes it is a slow process but Chris is very slow in figuring things out. I didn't tell her yesterday that progressives are meant to be worn full time but I did say something to her a few days ago. She did make a comment a couple of days ago that she is concerned she will need new glasses every year. She may feel that wearing glasses full time will make her eyes worse. I told her that is not the case and the chances are her script will not change very much in the future.Maybe only a slightly higher add. Right now she is +2.00 so she may eventually get to +2.50 which is where I am. But I will be 63 on Saturday and she just turned 54 in March. And how my vision has not changed much over the past number of years. And my eye doctor told me I could keep the same glasses from two years ago since the change in my vision this year was very small. Here are my scripts. </p><p> </p><p>2014 OD Sphere +.75 Cylinder -1.00 Axis 160 Add +2.50 </p><p>OS Sphere +.75 Cylinder -1.25 Axis 15 Add +2.50 </p><p> </p><p>2015 OD Sphere +1.00 Cylinder -1.00  Axis 105 Add +2.50  </p><p>OS Sphere +.75 Cylinder -.75 Axis 15 Add +2.50 </p><p> </p><p>2016 OD Sphere +1.00 Cylinder -.75 Axis 115 Add +2.50 </p><p>OS Sphere +.50 Cylinder -1.00 Axis 15 Add +2.50 </p><p> </p><p>I haven't had much change at all since 2014 have I? I still remember what Cactus Jack always says how the cylinder readings are very subjective.Also my ophthalmologist does not dispense glasses so I go to a local optical store five minutes away from my apartment. But I have kept the same glasses since 2014. Do you consider it a conflict of interest when the place you get your eyes examined also dispenses glasses?They may try to sell you glasses you don't really need. But you always have the option not to get the script filled or go someplace else to do so. You don't have to buy your glasses from the place you get your eye exam if that is an option.  </p><p> </p><p>But I make sure each year I get a copy of my script even if I am not getting new glasses just in case something happens to my glasses. And in CT a script is only good for a year. So even if the script was identical to the previous one I still need a new script with a current date.  </p><p> </p><p>If I filled the 2016 script I doubt seriously it would improve my vision much from 2014. And I have to pay for glasses out of pocket so I really don't want to get new ones unless I have to. So I went along with my doctor's recommendation. She told me I could get new glasses if I wanted to but didn't really need to.  </p><p> </p><p>But Chris I think is beginning to see the benefits of wearing glasses full time. But not quite ready to completely take the plunge. Pretty soon she may even forget she is wearing them. And if you reach the point when you feel you need glasses at least 80% of the time you should be wearing them full time. I didn't ask her but I think she is wearing them most of the time at work too. Maybe not 100% of the time but a lot more than she wore her old ones. </p><p> </p><p>It seems like driving with them on is her biggest obstacle right now. She has to know her non prescription sunglasses don't help her see better. But the more she wears her prescription glasses the more she will need to wear them and may one day actually drive her car wearing them. And I thought of another thing. If she is wearing them almost the entire day at work driving home without them is going to even become more difficult than it was already. Do you agree? </p><p> </p><p>I think Chris knows the deal and don't need to tell her. She needs to wear her glasses full time. But she still will try to avoid wearing them at times because she has not yet come to grips with being a full time wearer.She thinks somehow if she wears them all the time it will make her eyes worse but you and I both know that isn't the case. If her eyes get worse it will have nothing to do with how much or how little she wears her glasses.For Chris being able to see should be her top priority and she sees much better when she wears her glasses than if she doesn't. But she has worn them over the last few days much more than I thought she would. Actually leaving the house twice in the last three days with glasses on her face when going out with her boyfriend is something I never thought I would ever see Chris do. So yes she has surprised me. </p><p> </p><p>And she has actually used her eyeglass case which is also a first for Chris. Also one other benefit of wearing glasses full time is she wouldn't have to carry her eyeglass case in her purse. She could leave it at home. Also good because she likes small purses and small purses don't hold much stuff. It would be one less thing she would have to carry around with her.Also not having to search for her glasses all the time when she needs to read something because they would already be on her face. Chris is very disorganized so wearing her glasses all the time besides greatly improving her vision would also simplify her life. If she wears them she will not lose them and also the chances of them breaking will lessen.  </p><p> </p><p>I asked her if she got any comments about her glasses at work and she said everybody likes them. I do too.So does her boyfriend.So there is no excuse for her not to wear them all day long. Since Chris has come this far she needs to go all the way now. Her boyfriend agrees with me that Chris needs to wear her glasses full time. Maybe he has told her that but I don't know for sure. But something made her start wearing them more this past weekend and I know it was nothing I said. But she did tell me yesterday now she can see. Which tells me she understands why she needs to wear them. If it is OK for me to wear glasses full time it should be OK for her too.And her script for her left eye is much higher than either of mine. </p><p> </p><p>And does it surprise you that no eye doctor or optician before now never offered any suggestions as to when she should wear her glasses? And she got her first bifocals about 6 years ago.Before that she used over the counter readers which she told me she was using since she was about 40.But I think Chris really believed her bifocals were just to be used for reading. So I am happy this doctor laid it on the line to her.I knew for a long time her eyes were bad enough for her to need glasses full time.But couldn't say anything to her because all she would have said to me is I am not an eye doctor. True but you don't have to be an eye doctor to understand the numbers on a glasses prescription. Chris doesn't like it when people tell her things she doesn't want to hear. Even though I might know what I am talking about.                    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;02 May 2016, 12:55</p><p>Soundmanpt- A couple of more things about vision testing. I agree with you that the cost should not be prohibitive.At most to pay for it maybe they would have to raise the cost of a license from 72.00 for six years to maybe 80.00. And we have to appear in person anyway because of the picture.The equipment probably wouldn't cost that much to put in every AAA and DMV office.And it probably will not cause much more of a delay than we have already because the eye exam would be very quick. But as it is unless you are very lucky when you go to DMV for any reason to plan on being there for at least an hour. Not a good place to go if you have plans later on in the day.We don't get a very good return on the dollar do we for renewing our driver's licenses? You pay half of what we do and get an eye exam out of the deal even though it is very quick and not very comprehensive. I guess they want to make sure you can read the 20/40 line and do they test anything else like depth perception? I don't know since it has been 40 years since I had a DMV eye exam. All I remember is it was very short and that they passed me when they should not have. I had my glasses with me to cover my butt but never had to put them on. Although my eye doctor never could figure out how I passed without wearing my glasses. </p><p> </p><p>And yes there have to be some people out there who have a vision restriction on their licenses but continue to drive without correction. But these people are taking a chance. Because if they are stopped for any reason at all  and the cop asks to see the person's license and he or she isn't wearing glasses they will get a ticket. And I bet the fine would be at least 100.00. </p><p> </p><p>Also read that when CT first passed the law for vision testing it was targeted for senior drivers but then it was changed because of organizations like AARP who protect the rights of senior citizens. Seniors can run into eye problems but younger people can as well. So that is when they changed it to everybody for every other license renewal no matter how old they are. But seniors are regarded as very safe drivers because they tend to be more cautious and don't do things like text and drive at the same time. </p><p> </p><p>Texting and driving is a whole other issue. I can text but am not real good at it so no way I would ever try doing it while driving. But it is hard to believe that a handful of states including CT never require an eye exam for drivers other than when the person first gets a driver's license. Yes doing vision screenings would cost the state money but I think this is very important so there should be a way to pay for it. Probably by increasing the cost of drivers' licenses. We pay a lot already so a few dollars more isn't that big of a deal. And you have to get a 6 year license at least until age 65 and then you have the option of a 2 year license. That is how things work in the state of CT.             </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 May 2016, 12:18</p><p>Michael </p><p>It does seem like she is at least starting to find that her glasses really are helping her see things better. However it is a very slow learning process as you can see. When she asked you when you started wearing your glasses full time you really missed a golden chance to give her nice big push. You should have answered her as you did and then thrown in that once you get progressives you really need to be wearing them from the time you get up until you go back to bed that night. And point blank told her she needs to be wearing her glasses every waking minute period. Is going to kike hearing that? No of course not, but it needs to be said to her and don't be so afraid to really tell her off about her non sense idea of somehow thinking that her non prescription sunglasses are helping her in anyway. She won't like hearing those things but I have a feeling the more she thinks about what you have said to her the more it might start to sink in. Just be sure to let her know how much you like her as a friend and you just don't want anything to happen to her. Once you have said your piece than let it go. You can sleep good knowing that you did everything possible and if anything happens it's totally on her. But your driving yourself nuts over this and you need to stop trying. Say what you need to say and "JUST LET IT GO"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;02 May 2016, 11:56</p><p>Likelenses-Thank you for the links for the simulators. I have been playing around with them and putting in Chris' numbers and it does appear her vision without glasses is quite blurry. But if it is really as bad as it appears I don't know how she is managing to drive without corrective lenses. But somehow she is managing to. It appears to me she is mainly using her right eye but the problem is her right eye isn't that good either.And if she ever put a patch on her right eye and just used her left even as stubborn as she is I think even she would know she couldn't do it. Everything in the distance might be a complete blur.Using just her left eye I don't think driving would be difficult. It would be impossible.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;02 May 2016, 11:33</p><p>Soundmanpt-That girl sounds so much like Chris.Chris I think would be the same way if they put a vision restriction on her license. She wouldn't have a clue as to what it means. She wouldn't understand that it means you must always drive with your glasses on and if you didn't and were stopped by a cop for any reason and weren't wearing your glasses you would likely get a ticket and be subject to a fine.How much the fine would be I have no clue but she would be breaking the law. And I am guessing now from what you are telling me that this girl is now a full time wearer which she probably should have been a long time ago. </p><p> </p><p>And now the latest update on Chris. Even though she never got them adjusted she claims they feel better now so she has actually been wearing them more although not full time. Meaning around the house and to watch TV. And Saturday night she went with her boyfriend to his house and actually left our apartment wearing her glasses which I believe is a first.And she spent the night at her boyfriend's and got back home Sunday around noontime and was wearing them although she took them off after she got home. Then the rest of the day she had them on some of the time and off some of the time.Today Chris was off so she did laundry. So when I woke up she was up already so I gave her the money for the laundry. She was not wearing her glasses then.Then left the house without wearing her glasses and came back not wearing them. I have no idea if she put them on in the laundry mat. But after she got home her boy fiend came over and Chris has had her glasses on ever since.She made a couple of phone calls, watched some TV and they are now playing cards.  </p><p> </p><p>What do you make out of this? But one thing Chris will not do is drive wearing her prescription glasses.It is still her non prescription sunglasses she is wearing. I still want to do the prescription sunglasses through Zenni. But not sure I want to ask Chris yet. May bring up the subject to her boyfriend to see what he thinks. I am willing to buy them and pay for them but if I get them for her I want her to junk the non prescription sunglasses which don't help her one bit and wear the prescription ones instead. And guess what Chris and her boy friend just went out again and Chris kept her glasses on. But I am sure Paul will drive. At least it is daytime. Paul admitted to me he doesn't see well at night but when Chris and Paul go out together he always drives. But Saturday night she should have driven because since she was wearing her glasses I am sure she could see better than he can. But that is an entirely different issue. Paul is the next one who should go for an eye exam but he doesn't have vision insurance and can't really afford it.  </p><p> </p><p>Chris has admitted to me she sees so much better wearing her glasses than without. Which I already knew given the strength of her prescription. Her glasses I am sure are making a big difference. Slowly but surely she seems to be heading toward full time wear.Which is what the doctor told her to do. But she is still unwilling to put them on first thing in the morning and just leave them on all day until she goes to bed at night. Probably a psychological barrier because I don't think Chris wants to think of herself as a full time glasses wearer even though that is what she needs to do. No reason for her to ever take them off unless she is showering.  </p><p> </p><p>But I am happy she is wearing them a lot more although not full time yet. What Chris doesn't know I don't think is the more she wears her glasses the more she will need to do so. Which pretty soon will make driving without corrective lenses next to impossible.Not that it is easy now. But her left eye in particular is starving for correction so when she is not wearing her glasses Chris is not going to feel very comfortable. Do you agree with my analysis? I may get my wish sooner rather than later. Chris may be left with no choice than to become a full time glasses wearer. </p><p> </p><p>And she did ask me yesterday how long I have worn glasses full time. I said since I was about 45 when I got my first progressive lenses. But it was not a big adjustment for me because with my previous glasses I was almost full time already. But I still tried to occasionally get away without wearing them especially to social gatherings.But once I got the progressives I just went full time right from the start. And had no problem either adjusting to them or wearing them all the time.Do you agree with me that progressives are usually meant to be worn full time?  </p><p> </p><p>But it may be a bigger adjustment for Chris to go from being an occasional or part time glasses wearer to full time. But she does seem to realize now just how well she sees with her glasses at all distances and how poorly she sees when she isn't wearing them.So the more she wears them the more she will feel she needs to wear them which should mean full time wear sooner rather than later. This is a battle she is fighting but in the end I believe she will have to give in and keep her glasses on all day long like the doctor told her to.He did tell Chris she needs to wear her glasses if she wants to see and I think Chris enjoys seeing clearly which she does when she is wearing her glasses.                 </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2016, 09:34</p><p>Michael </p><p>So you do still have to renew your driver's license every 6 years in CT as well and like Missouri you have to go to a DMV office to renew. Like CT we also get a new picture taken every time as well. So the only thing they don't do is the eye check? That is even more crazy because you really only need one person to do that and it takes only a few seconds to do. And just like your state they don't care if your able to see 20/20 or 20/30 they only check to see if you can see 20/40 and that is all. Even worse that you have to pay so much more. Yesterday when I sent the prices to you I wasn't exactly sure what the cost was so I googled it to be check. Honestly it is bad enough that i'm sure quite a few even here in Missouri where it has the vision restriction shown on your license a good number still doesn't bother wearing their glasses as required. But without it being indicated on your license i'm sure way more are driving around without glasses that they really should be wearing. Someone I knew from a local sports bar had one to get her license renewed and since I knew she needed glasses but was in a way very much like your friend Chris and seldom ever wore her glasses when she really had enough of a prescription that she could have easily been wearing her glasses full time. I knew she didn't wear her glasses for driving because I was often at the sports bar when I saw her pull up and get out of her car without glasses. So when she told me that she had to go and renew her driver's license i was sure she would fail the vision test and be told she needed to wear her glasses to drive. So one evening when she was serving me i asked her if she had gone to renew her license yet? She said she did. I asked her if she she got a restriction on her driver's license to wear glasses. She said that when she took the vision test she wasn't able to see what they asked her to and the girl told her she needed to put her glasses on and she was then able to pass. But she said they never told her that she needed to wear her glasses to drive. I told her it was marked on her driver's license. She didn't believe me and went and brought me her new driver's license and sure enough under restrictions was an "A" which indicates vision correction. If she would have looked at the backside of her license it said what the various codes are meant. Even still she didn't want to believe me and she went around to some of the the other patrons that she knew and was asking them if that meant she needed to wear her glasses for driving. After everyone told her it did she finally came over and said she would try and remember to start wearing her glasses when she is driving but like Chris she didn't see why since she thought she was sure she could see well enough without them but at the same time admitted that she couldn't read any road signs without her glasses but she didn't need to anyway since she knew where she was going. I'm sure she still didn't wear her glasses like she was supposed to. Funny thing happened to her not too long after this. Even though she is really a very attractive young lady she is somewhat of a tomboy. Every year she looked forward to going deer hunting when the season came along with her family and bf. I didn't remember that it was deer hunting time because I am not a hunter. Anyway I was at the sports bar and her sister also worked there and she isn't a hunter either. I asked where her sister was and she told me that she was deer hunting. I was surprised that she actually hunted and wasn't just along to keep her bf company. I joked with her sister that what scary thing having her out in the woods with gun and she she can't see very well. Her sister knows that she needs to wear her glasses and she pretty much refused to ever wear them. Her sister said that even though she hates to wear her glasses she does wear them while hunting and that she is even a very good shot. Anyway when she got back I asked her if she got any deer and she said she wasn't able to hunt at all because she forgot her glasses. She wasn't very happy about that at all. She signed up for the Air force and is stationed out in California. She told me once that her dream was to be a fighter pilot and she was disappointed when she found out that she needed to have 20/20 in order to even try. She was learning bi lingual. She was home on leave once just after basic training and I was happy to see her wearing her glasses. She said when she took her physical and did an eye exam she was told that she must have her glasses on whenever she on call. They provided her with a nice pair of as she called them glasses that would make sure she never got pregnant. So i'm sure once she was forced to wear her glasses while on duty she soon couldn't get by without them anymore.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;29 Apr 2016, 11:25</p><p>Soundmanpt-You are lucky you live in Missouri. CT is an expensive state to live in. Here it is 72.00 for 6 years to renew a license and once you turn 65 you have the option to renew for 2 years instead of 6 for 24.00 which works out the same 12.00 per year. Hard to believe that the cost of a driver's license is more than double here compared to Missouri.  </p><p> </p><p>With what they charge for license renewals CT should find a way to include periodic vision screenings as part of the process. And if they have to raise the cost by a few dollars I don't see what the big deal is. And it might help prevent auto accidents and potentially save lives.  </p><p> </p><p>I don't remember much about the vision screening I had when I got my license because it was 40 years ago. I never got my license until I was 23 unlike most people who get it at either 16 or 17.But I do recall it not taking very long. I think they just want to see if you can read the 20/40 line which in most states is the cutoff I think. If you can do that they really don't care if you can read the 20/30 or 20/20 lines. But somehow I faked my way through the eye test. I remember I had my glasses with me but didn't need to put them on. I was as bad as Chris when I was young because I didn't wear my glasses for driving for a long time. And when my eye doctor found out much later I didn't and also told him I never got an optical restriction on my license he couldn't figure out that happened when I told him how old I was when I got my license. He knew what my vision was then and what the cutoff was. He then said he wouldn't say anything to DMV but to start wearing my glasses which I did. Which does make me think what if anything would happen if I called up Chris' eye care professional and told him she is not wearing her glasses when driving.  </p><p> </p><p>But it is a pain here to renew your license. You can't do it online or by mail and must come either to a DVM or AAA office. Because they have to take your picture. And I know people who actually try to pose for the picture which is almost impossible. And if you don't like the way your picture comes out I don't think they will take another one.I always go to my local DMV office and they is one right in the city I live in. And it is a zoo there most of the time. You pretty much can count on being there for at least an hour no matter what you go there for.I could go to an AAA office I guess but those are farther away than DMV. My birthday is next week and I think my license is good until 2019 so I still have 3 years to go. I think DMV is on almost everybody's list as  one of their least favorite places to go and it is one of those places that mostly everybody has to go at one time or another.   </p><p> </p><p>I know the DMV vision screenings are not very thorough but in states that have then might let a person know his  or her vision is not up to par. A lot of people never go for eye exams if they don't feel they have a problem. One more thought. If CT doesn't want to do DMV vision screenings couldn't they make a certificate from an eye care professional a requirement to renew a license? Maybe not at every renewal but maybe every other one which would be every 12 years. There has to be a way to get people with impaired vision either off the road or force them to wear corrective lenses. Only having to pass a DMV eye exam once in your life is crazy.        </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Apr 2016, 09:38</p><p>Michael </p><p>Actually if you think about it by having to renew your driver's license every 6 years they should be making money by charging each time. The 6 year renewal is $35.00 and the 3 year is $17.50. I just looked up how it works here and from 16 to 20 you need to renew every 3 years. then it is 6 years from 21 to 69 and then it goes back to 3 years from 70 on. If you think about it that makes good sense because eyesight is very likely to change during your teen years and then gets much more stable for distance from 20 - 39 and then have changes once your around 70. Judging by how full the DMV is when you go in most times I would think they would make more than enough money to cover renewals. The eye exam is a very simple machine that sits on the end of the counter and is much like what they use for vision screening. The operator only asks you to see about 3 things and that is it. It takes less than 2 minutes. Not the last time but the time before when I had to take the vision test it was an attractive young lady doing the test and she was wearing glasses. So I thought I would tease her a bit as I finished my test. I pointed at her her glasses and asked her if she failed the vision test? She was very sweet and started laughing and said that she in fact did fail the test after she had started working there and that was when she got her glasses. I told her I was only teasing and she said she knew but she said she had no idea that she needed glasses until she took the test herself. She said she then knew how everyone must have felt that she had to fail. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;29 Apr 2016, 09:08</p><p>Soundmanpt-Yes it is crazy that there are states that never require an eye exam to renew your license and you only have to pass an eye exam once in your life and that is when you first get your license. CT is one state and Melyssa said PA is another. I did some research on the subject and it appears the majority of states do but there are some who don't. I think I told you this before but a number of years ago  CT did pass a law that would have required a vision test for every other license renewal which would have been every 12 years but the law was never implemented because of a lack of funds.But in my opinion this is very important and CT should have found the money someplace to implement the law they passed.Found some info on the subject. The law was passed in 1990 but wasn't repealed until 2011. </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Connecticut-drops-never-used-law-requiring-vision-1424193.php" target="_blank">http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Connecticut-drops-never-used-law-requiring-vision-1424193.php</a>   </p><p> </p><p>There has to be a way to force people like Chris to wear glasses when driving because it doesn't appear she will do so otherwise. She even admitted to me she can't read signs. She told me she can see the signs but just can't read what is on them. What good does that do? It would be like somebody acknowledging they can see an eye chart but can't read any letters on it.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Apr 2016, 08:28</p><p>I live in the state of Missouri and here you can can a learners permit at 15 and you need to take the necessary vision test at that time. Then I think once you get your driver's license at the age of 16, or older, you need to return after 2 years to renew it until your in your 21 and an eye exam is given each time. Once your 21 then you only need to renew it every 6 years and that includes an eye exam. Honestly it seems pretty crazy to think that other states don't ever have you at least come in to check your eyesight. It scares be because I know how many of the young ladies I get glasses for didn't need glasses when they got their driver's license and now many of them wear glasses full time and I am sure they wouldn't be able to see well enough to drive without glasses anymore. Several years ago I even got a referral from someone that had gotten glasses from me and her best friend went to renew her driver's license and failed the vision test and she was in a panic because she needed to be able to drive to back and forth from work. She didn't have the money at the time to go and get her eyes examined and pay for glasses at the only one hour place where the prices are quite high. Her friend told her that maybe I could help her out so she called me. We met and she was lucky because at the time I had a range of of sample glasses with prescriptions ranging from -.50 to -1.75. By trying on each pair she found that the -1.25 glasses worked the best for her. I loaned her the glasses so she could pass the test and she ordered a pair of glasses from me in that same -1.25 prescription. I let her borrow my sample pair until her own glasses arrived. I told her that the next time she needs glasses where she can go to get her eyes examined for $35.00. Not quite a year later she called me to tell me that she had gone where I had recommended to get her eyes examined and she needed new glasses. We met and she was still wearing the glasses she had gotten from me. Her prescription had changed slightly and she had some astigmatism, but not too much stronger than the glasses she was wearing. Not long after that she got a better job that took her to Chicago.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2016, 13:07</p><p>Michael, </p><p> </p><p>I guess CT is like PA then.  When I went for my learner's permit at age 16, I took the eye test, and seeing that I was wearing glasses, they put the infamous "L" (must wear corrective lenses) on the license.  There is some other code now, but no eye tests are done after the first successful (such as it is) one.  I do think it would be good to test for color recognition, as a lot of many imbeciles out there run red lights and stop signs.  Then again, they see the red items and figure it doesn't apply to them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2016, 06:19</p><p>Melyssa- Do they ever require a vision test for you to renew your license in PA? Most states require it but not necessarily for every license renewal. It could be every other one or possibly more often once you reach a certain age. The point I was making is in CT most people only need to pass a vision test once in their life. And that is when they first get their license. So unless the person upgrades or there is another unusual circumstance you don't have to pass a vision test ever again as long as you keep your driver's license. There may be people driving on CT roads and highways who are half blind.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2016, 05:03</p><p>Two days ago I made my quadrennial visit to the DOT Photo License Center in my hometown in the state of Pennsylvania -- Philadelphia to the east, Pittsburgh to the west, and Alabama in between.  I was there no more than 15 minutes, and the DOT employee asked for my then-current license (okay, still current through this Saturday), and for me to answer some questions on the keypad of the computer, and he took my picture.  I was wearing clear frames.  Two minutes later, I had my new driver's license.  That's it, new picture, no eye test, and they had already been paid beforehand.  :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2016, 18:10</p><p>astigmaphile-I agree 100% with you. I don't know where you live but you may not ever want to drive in CT. A number of years ago CT passed a law requiring eye exams every other license renewal but never put the law into place because they didn't have the money. Many people are probably driving who shouldn't be.Like my roommate Chris.And guess what today after she got home from work she went into a state of panic because she couldn't find her non prescription sunglasses. And she was planning to go out later. She has it in her head that somehow those sunglasses improve her vision but they don't do a thing. But she did eventually find the sunglasses. Not sure what I am going to do with her. She has poor vision but continues to drive without wearing corrective lenses.Most of the time when she leaves for work in the morning I am still sleeping so I am thinking after she goes to bed at night to try to find the sunglasses and if I do take them and hide them in my room. If she couldn't find her sunglasses in the morning I swear to god she might not be able to go to work. She would then have two options. Either drive bare eyed or drive with her regular prescription glasses and I don't think she could do either. </p><p> </p><p>She has it in her head that she can only drive wearing non prescription sunglasses. She thinks somehow they improve her vision and Chris' uncorrected vision is probably no better than about 20/70. And it may even be worse than that.Chris is so addicted to her worthless sunglasses she even has to wear them on cloudy and rainy days.People can have a lot of addictions. Eating, smoking, drinking or gambling. But did you ever hear of anybody being addicted to a pair of sunglasses? That is a new one for me.But this is Chris I am dealing with. Maybe she should keep them on all day. Meaning at home and at work. Since she likes them so much and really thinks they improve her vision why not wear them all day long? If I was her that is what I would do. But she only wears them for driving and goes bare eyed most of the rest of the time.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2016, 16:16</p><p>I can't believe that there are states that only check your vision the first time that you get a driver's license. Eyes change, especially in older people. Think cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration. I certainly do not want to be on the road around someone who is visually impaired.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2016, 05:37</p><p>Am I interpreting this correctly David? You have been wearing your glasses full time all along including for driving but now your have an optical restriction on your license so you have no choice? I don't know what your uncorrected vision is but it never would have been a good idea for you to drive without wearing your glasses even though legally you could. </p><p> </p><p>I am dealing with the same thing now with my roommate Chris. CT is also a place where most people only have to take a DMV eye test one time in their life and that is when they first get their license and unless they upgrade like you did or some other unusual circumstance occurs it is very likely they will never have to pass a DMV eye test ever again. That is not good. Because Chris and probably many other people in our state as well drive and are putting both themselves and innocent bystanders at risk by not wearing corrective lenses. But I also have been told that if Chris was ever involved in a serious car accident and other people were either seriously injured or died and it was later discovered she was told by an eye care professional to wear glasses when driving and that she wasn't when she had the accident she could then be in a mess of trouble. That would supersede Chris not having an optical restriction on her driver's license.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2016, 01:23</p><p>Yes I've been full time for many years.  I get tested often because the axis changes enough that in a year I'm not happy with my correction. </p><p> </p><p>I live in Canada where I've never been required to have my eyes re-tested to renew my license but in this case I was upgrading.  Probably it was at the discretion of the person behind the counter.  No worries, I always have glasses anyway.  Just feels like a bit of a loss to have corrective lenses restriction.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;25 Apr 2016, 04:48</p><p>You may be like me and live in a state that ordinarily does not require a vision test except for when you get your license. I live in CT. There are probably a lot of people driving here who should not be including my roommate. And it puts both them and innocent people at risk. You may have seen my many posts about my roommate Chris. </p><p> </p><p>Not sure what your uncorrected vision is but in most states the cutoff is 20/40 and you didn't make the grade. At least you passed with your glasses on.Have you had an eye exam recently? You say you are 56 and when you were 46 your sphere was 0 so my guess is no. If you haven't it might be a good idea. Do you wear your glasses full time? Your cylinder numbers are quite high so you may definitely benefit from full time wear. I guess you have an optical restriction on your driver's license now so you have no choice but to wear your glasses when driving.Not sure how the vision testing machine at DMV works but you saying you couldn't read a single letter tells me your vision is  worse than whatever their cutoff is which is usually 20/40.Maybe much worse. And with the amount of astigmatism you have it definitely would impact both your near and distance vision and I think most people would wear their glasses full time.        </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2016, 06:35</p><p>Jennifer-How did you ever manage without glasses for as long as you did? It sure didn't take long for you to become dependent on them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2016, 06:31</p><p>I was very dizzy when I got the -1.75 prescription but I kept wearing the glasses because they helped a great deal. The dizziness went away by the end of the day. The new glasses made me nauseous for 30 minutes but I quickly got used to them and to the contacts that I got when I went back the second time.  </p><p> </p><p>The only problem is that I am virtually blind without my lenses in! I have to bring the alarm clock right up to my face to set the time and I reach for my glasses before doing anything else in the morning! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2016, 18:31</p><p>Jennifer-Since those were your first glasses the doctor may have under prescribed you the first time to make the adjustment to them a little easier. But since you couldn't see perfectly clearly after a week he bumped you up a little bit. The right eye is always listed first which is OD Ocular Dexter which I believe is a Latin term. OS is the left eye which is Ocular Sinister.Your right eye appears to be the one with a small amount of astigmatism in it. But even a small amount of astigmatism can blur your vision both for close and distance. Reading small print can be especially difficult. Was it very difficult to get used to the stronger script especially considering you never wore glasses before? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2016, 17:40</p><p>The first time I went in I was prescribed -1.75 in both eyes but after wearing the glasses for a week I noticed that my vision was still a little blurry so it got bumped up to -2.25 -0.50 180 and -2.00 </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2016, 16:39</p><p>Jennifer- That is very high for a first script. You probably needed glasses for a while.What made you get an eye exam? I would guess you were having trouble reading the board in class. College puts a big demand on eyes. Not sure how you got away with not wearing glasses for as long as you did. And yes I am almost certain those other numbers are for astigmatism. Sphere is the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness. Cylinder is the amount of astigmatism Axis is the angle of the astigmatism and it can be anywhere between 0 and 180. It is kind of hard to explain but those are what your other numbers are I am almost certain. Astigmatism is always two numbers. Cylinder and axis. So a person who is either nearsighted or farsighted with astigmatism will always have three numbers for each eye on their script. </p><p> </p><p>You had to notice a big difference with the way you see with your glasses so it is not surprising you are struggling now when you don't wear them. So it was not a very difficult decision to wear them full time which I am assuming you do because you really have to if you want to see well.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2016, 16:19</p><p>David- It is no wonder you couldn't pass the DMV eye test. Your sphere is low but the amount of astigmatism you have in each eye is significant which would impact both your close and distance vision.How old are you and how long have you had glasses? You would probably benefit from full time wear because of the astigmatism. I don't know what your uncorrected vision is but it is obviously less than 20/40 or 20/50. I live in a state CT which doesn't ever require a vision test when renewing your license. There are not many states like that. I think years ago CT put in a law for vision screenings for license renewals but the law was never implemented because of a lack of money. But the states that do at least most of them I think require 20/40 minimum to pass.And most states require eye exams at least at every other license renewal which would be about once every 12 years.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2016, 15:58</p><p>No more going without glasses for driving.  Just had eyes tested to renew my license and I couldn't see the letters inside their testing machine.  I'm guessing I needed to have 20-40 or 20-50.  Rx is -1 Sph, -2.25 Cyl in each eye.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2016, 15:07</p><p>Michael, I'm 19 (about to be 20) and in college. -2.50 and -2.00 is my prescription for contacts. The prescription for glasses has a few other numbers which must be astigmatism.  </p><p>These are my first glasses/contacts! I know it's crazy. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2016, 07:45</p><p>Jenny </p><p>Those lenses you were asking about are called "Ortho-K" and they have been on and off the market several times over the years. Your prescription isn't even close to being considered strong and your optician said that your prescription is too strong for them to work for you, that they only work for weaker prescriptions. So they work great if you only barely need vision correction. If her prescription is only -3.00 and by the end of the day the effect of the contacts is already wearing off and her vision is blurry she either has to try and get by as her vision slowly continues to get more blurry or she has to have her glasses with her at all times to put on. This is why they were taken off the market before. I heard the very same thing years ago from the manager of a Sears Optical that said she had the very same problem as your optician. Oh and did I mention that they are very expensive?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;14 Apr 2016, 19:42</p><p>Jennifer- Are these your first glasses? May I ask how old you are? So your script is -2.50 and -2.00 with no astigmatism. Am I correct?As others have said here many times there is no rule as to when to wear your glasses. No glasses police to check on you.But I can see how you don't do real well bare eyed and need to wear vision correction pretty much full time. I think most people with your script would. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jenny</b>&nbsp;14 Apr 2016, 15:07</p><p>I was wearing glasses all the time at -2.00 and now I can't be without them. The lenses you can wear at night won't work for me because they work better in lower prescriptions. My optician has them and says in the evening her eyes are blurry again and she is with -3.00. I couldn't think to be out and my eyes are blurry and didn't have glasses with me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;14 Apr 2016, 11:47</p><p>I agree but at some point probably sooner rather than later your eyes will stabilize and your increases won't be as much.You may not get much higher than the -5.5 you are currently at. But going from -1 to -5.5 in about 6 years sounds pretty normal to me.Myopia does usually keep increasing sometimes at a pretty rapid rate for a number of years until it begins to level off. Hopefully you are just about at that point now.And you weren't prescribed glasses until you were 14 so you started late and even then your script was weak. Myopia often begins at a much younger age than you were. I was 9 years old when I got my first glasses for distance.  </p><p></p><hr>

When you got your first glasses did you wear them full time out of necessity or were you one that always wanted to wear glasses? You mentioned about your difficulties applying makeup without your lenses being in, so I assume you must wear contacts these days at least some of the time?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kristy</b>&nbsp;11 Apr 2016, 18:12</p><p>Can't remember. I wear them from dawn to dusk. Can't even set the alarm on my phone without them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;11 Apr 2016, 15:55</p><p>Kristy, when did you last do anything bare eyed ?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Apr 2016, 09:40</p><p>Kristy </p><p>That is completely reasonable that you went straight to full time wear even at -1.00. You simply enjoyed the clarity that your glasses gave you, and didn't like how things looked without them anymore. Yet many others might hardly ever bother taking the time to put their glasses on with such a weak prescription.  </p><p>Several years ago I was visiting with an optician friend of mine that worked at a Sam's Club Optical Center. While we were chatting a young lady came and needed her glasses adjusted because she said they weren't feeling right. My fiend looked at her and then reached behind her ears and was checking where the earpieces were hitting behind her ears and then she took her off of her and went to her work table and did some bending on them. While she was doing that this young lady was looking around the store which is of course very big in size and she was squinting. She looked at me and was complaining about how bad her eyesight is. I couldn't help but notice my friend smiling and shaking her head. After a few adjustments she came back over and put her glasses back on her and asked her if that was better and the young lady said they seemed to be fine. As soon as she left my friend started laughing and said she almost lost it when she heard her telling me how bad her eyesight is. She said this young lady used to come in every 6 months or so to get her eyes examined and her eyes were completely perfect but she would always come in saying that she thought she needed glasses. Finally the doctor wrote her a prescription for glasses, -.25 in both eyes. He told her it was her option if she wanted to get glasses or not, but of course she wanted glasses. So now that she had glasses she stops in about once every month or so to get them adjusted and she is always wearing her glasses. Anyway the point is that it is up to the person when they feel like they need to wear their glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kristy</b>&nbsp;09 Apr 2016, 08:04</p><p>I wore them full time from the beginning. -1 </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2016, 17:29</p><p>Kristy </p><p>In most cases your exactly right but there are some people that can tolerate blur better than others and can function pretty well without glasses with rather strong prescriptions. If "no name" has over the years just refused to wear glasses and has adjusted to seeing that way it is possible. There has been several in here that have claimed to be able to drive without glasses and had prescriptions of over -5.00. Needless to say I think that is pushing things much too far. For many I think somewhere around -1.50 or -1.75 is most start wearing their glasses full time. Do you recall what your prescription was when you started wearing your glasses full time?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kristy</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2016, 16:06</p><p>You're clearly not a -6.5  </p><p> </p><p>I'm -5.5 and I can't even wear my makeup without my lenses in.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2016, 15:39</p><p>No it not that strong.  I have -6.5 and spend much of me day without glasses.  I don't put except when i really need.  don't be wuss and wear time all -4.5.  Is not strong at all. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2016, 07:18</p><p>Jenny  </p><p>You asked for information about the contact lenses that you wear while you sleep and remove them when you wake and you can go the whole day without any need for glasses or contacts. They are called "Ortho-K" and based on your prescription they would seem to work for you. However when they first came out they were only out a short time and were pulled because there was problems with them. I am not sure but I was told that the biggest problem was that they only provided you with perfect vision several hours and then your own natural eyesight would start to return and you were caught in between because your eyes weren't quite to the point where you needed your glasses but you weren't seeing very well without glasses either. This of course would be a major problem if you were on a road trip and driving and your eyes were slowly changing back. But after not being available for several years they reappeared and seem to be working okay for people. The downside might be the price as they cost anywhere from $1000.00 to $1500.00 for one pair. Oh and they are gas permeable lenses which foe many often times seem harder to wear and aren't that comfortable. Because the cost is so much you might be better saving the cost yearly cost of those contacts and just getting lasik once your eyes stop changing. But to be honest your prescription isn't really that strong even though you can't really go without your glasses anymore. Your lenses aren't that thick and if you want them even thinner you can always do that and with a nice looking frame you have to look very nice wearing your glasses. If you really don't want to wear glasses then for now just look at your need for glasses as being temporary thing and in a few more years you can be glasses free if you really want to be.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kristy</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2016, 20:00</p><p>Jenny, -4.50 may not be super strong but it's strong enough and you will be completely dependent on your glasses. I'm -5 and I reach for my glasses first thing in the morning and feel completely blind without them!  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2016, 08:17</p><p>Jenny  </p><p>For most people it starts when your young. Maybe even before your a teenager or when your in your early teens. And the cause is most often the genes you git from a parent. So if one parent got glasses as a teen there would be at least a 50% chance that the children will need glasses. If both parents wore glasses in their teen years the odds are even worse like about 100%. No it is very unlikely that you had anything to do with your eyesight becoming less than perfect. So that means when you get married and start a family there is at least a 50% chance that your kids will be wearing glasses. I'm sure you hated it when you had to start wearing glasses but they did at least make seeing things much easier didn't they? Are you okay with wearing glasses now or still not liking them very much? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jenny</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2016, 15:52</p><p>I never wanted to wear glasses hated getting my eyes tested. When I first got glasses I was surprised how much clearer it was with them. Without glasses now is so blurry. How do we get shortsighted is it bad habits like too much tv and reading in bad light? Do you think are face and head shape had anything to do with it? I read it's because our eyes grow too big. Can't do nothing about it. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2016, 14:59</p><p>Jenny </p><p>Your still in that bracket where your eyes are still changing. The good news is that now that your 23 you should be getting close to when your eyes become stable and won't be changing much or nearly as often. I'm sure when the optician is telling you that your eyes aren't really that bad and you can't hardly see anything without your glasses you have a hard time believing him or her? But your glasses and contacts in the optic world isn't even considered to be in what we refer to as "strong glasses" your actually in the moderate range with your prescription. The optic world doesn't consider glasses to be strong until they are -7.00 or more and i really think you won't get to that point. Remember Jenny if you don't like wearing glasses and contacts once your eyes stop and get stable you can always get lasik. But if your considering that option you should start saving now because the average price for a good doctor to do that is around $4500.00.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jenny</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2016, 14:44</p><p>Sorry I'm getting confused my new contacts -4.50 so has gone up. I'm 23 my eyes keep getting worse every year should I be worried? Optician says is not a strong prescription just need to wear them all the time tho. what is bad if get more shorsighted when you already have to wear glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Mar 2016, 08:28</p><p>Jenny </p><p>Yes you got a bit of an increase but really it wasn't very much at all. First of all your comparing when you last got your contacts to now getting new glasses. Because you do have a decent prescription if you had gotten glasses when you got your contacts I am sure they would have been at least -3.75 and maybe even -4.00 at that time. When you're wearing contacts they are sitting directly on your corneas bit your glasses sit about 3/4" in front of your eyes so your glasses lenses need to be slightly stronger to makeup for that difference in between. So it could be that you only got a real increase of about -.25 or -.50 which is really not bad at all. Also you didn't say how long ago you got your contacts which also makes a difference. If it was longer than a year since your last eye exam then you did even better than would be expected. As to when your eyes may stop changing depends a lot on your age. As you get closer to 20 you should see your increases getting even less. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;22 Mar 2016, 00:37</p><p>Jenny </p><p> When did you first get glasses,and what was the prescription then? </p><p> Have any previous increases been about as large as this last one? </p><p> While your present prescription is moderately strong,depending on your age who knows what it may go to.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2016, 19:50</p><p>Jenny, </p><p>Some people who are Myopic or shortsighted do not wear vision correction, however they are not doing themselves any favors. Typically, these people are only mildly Myopic and function fairly well, in their opinion, without vision correction. Usually, there is either a strong sense of vanity or a belief that by not wearing vision correction they slow down the progression of their myopia.  </p><p>The jury is still out on the long term effects of not wearing vision correction. There was one study out of Australia that seemed to indicate that not wearing vision correction actually made Myopia increase faster. </p><p>One thing that can occur, if correction is not worn, is that the Ciliary Muscles can get severely de-conditioned and effectively loose their ability to focus the Crystalline Lenses. In other words, creating the symptoms of Presbyopia long before it typically appears.  This is particularly true in cases where mild Myopia in the -1.50 to -3.50 range is present, WITHOUT or with very little Astigmatism, where there is a strong temptation to not wear vision correction for close work. </p><p>May is ask your prescription and how fast it is increasing? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jenny</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2016, 18:45</p><p>Has anyone been told they are shortsighted and not bothered to wear glasses? I'm shortsighted and it gets worse every year.

<p><b>Ellen</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2016, 11:06</p><p>My (younger) sister has a prescription around -8/-9. </p><p>Yes you can use a pin hole to see when you're myopic. This works because the light entering the eye is almost all coming perpendicularly through the centre of the cornea and the discrepancy in the curvature of the cornea doesn't play such a role in  producing the point of focus. The downside is that much less light enters the eye so the image isn't great and of course there's little peripheral vision. </p><p>As for spare glasses, she has several pairs. In fact we all keep a pair in the holiday cottage for emergencies. Unfortunately, scatter-brained as she is she'd forgotten that she'd taken hers home the last time she was there to have them turned into prescription sunglasses. She even wears contacts but had deliberately avoided taking them to force herself to give her eyes a rest from them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2016, 09:53</p><p>Ellen </p><p>I'm glad she found her glasses but there is a lesson to learned from this. Something I am always telling my glasses wearing friends all the time. If you only have a very weak prescription and are very able to get by without glasses then just having one pair is fine. But once you're wearing your glasses full time chances are you are at least nearing the point of being somewhat dependent on your glasses. Once that point is reached a backup pair is needed. You clearly mentioned that she does in fact have spare glasses but since she didn't bring the with her they were 100 miles away and of no help at all to her blurred vision. She should really keep her spare pair in her car or at least remember to pack them when she going to be away for even a few days. I get quite a few calls from people that have bought glasses from me because of the family dog getting hold of their glasses, (Dogs often take glasses because your body scent is on your glasses so to them its the same as giving them an old sock that you have worn to play with) and kids taking the glasses and either misplacing them like your sister's son did or even worse breaking them. If you have been following my posts with Katie in the New Glasses thread she had gotten her first glasses and she already had a fairly strong prescription. She pretty much went to full time wear right away. I convinced her that she really needed a spare pair in case something happened to her glasses even though she doesn't have a dog and she is in college and no kids around to break or lose them. At first she was reluctant because she didn't think anything could or would happen to her glasses. Well she went with her sister to an amusement park and she didn't think to take her glasses off when she got on a roller coaster and on the first downhill her glasses went fling off and were gone. It pretty much ruined her day at the park since she couldn't see very well. But she had taken my advice and ordered a spare pair which she at least had to put on when she got home. You just never know when something you don't expect might happen to your glasses.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ellen</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2016, 08:42</p><p>My sister took her kids to our family holiday home for a few days over the school half term. I got a call from her on Wednesday night saying she had lost her glasses. She thought her son, who is four, had taken them while she was in the shower. He had kind of owned up but couldn't remember what he'd done with them. She had been searching for them for over an hour and was frantic and sounded close to tears on the phone. There wasn't much I could do, she was over 100 miles away and I don't drive at night due to my own vision difficulties. Besides I had had a couple of glasses of wine. I told her that she'd just have to hang in there overnight and I'd drive over the following morning with her spares. I told her of a trick I use with a mobile phone to navigate my around if I don't have glasses. Just put the phone in camera mode and hold it close to your eyes and you get a nice clear video of your surroundings. Not ideal but better than walking into things. Anyway the story has a happy ending, she called me about an hour later saying her glasses had turned up. Her daughter had found them in the kitchen bin!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;01 Feb 2016, 15:04</p><p>Soundmanpt I definitely wasn't fully awake! I do my makeup without my glasses on and like many other glasses wearers I get the "phantom glasses" feeling - It sometimes feels like I'm wearing my glasses even if I'm not, which probably explains why I managed to leave the flat without my glasses on after doing my makeup in record time (luckily I don't wear much makeup).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2016, 10:05</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I really think that you most likely weren't fully awake when you dressed and ran out without your glasses being on. You have been wearing glasses full time now for 3 or 4 years and had never done that before. It would almost seem automatic now putting your glasses on. You most likely have an every morning way of getting ready which includes when you put your glasses on. I would think as you finish with your makeup would be rather normal. It could be if you skipped that step by running late is how you managed to run out without them? Now this being the first time you ever did that is interesting. I would have thought you might have done that maybe more than once when you first got glasses. Your prescription was very weak and you weren't used to wearing glasses. I could easily see how you might totally forget to put them on and head off to school without them. If you had forgot your glasses you could have easily got by without them. But you were so excited about having glasses I guess maybe that helped so you didn't ever forget them.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2016, 09:01</p><p>Carrie, </p><p> </p><p>You would be definitely better off carrying extra eyewear in your pocketbook.

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2016, 16:59</p><p>Carrie:  I had a similar experience a few weeks ago.  In a hurry, left the house and went directly to a meeting.  Only when I looked at my phone did I realize I forget my glasses.  Struggled through the meeting then retrieved them from my car.  My Rx is basically +1.00 each eye with a +2.75 add, so I really can't see anything within arms length...my distance vision is okay, but nothing up close!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2016, 12:02</p><p>I was in such a rush that I was in sort of autopilot mode and wasn't concentrating. It was when I had to concentrate on crossing a road that I noticed that I couldn't see as good as I should. Even though I wear my glasses full time my eyes aren't so bad that I can't see without them, although anything close up would be hard to see. I think that the little screen that displays the product name and price on the checkout as the barcode is scanned would be almost impossible for me to read and so would the buttons on the checkout. If my glasses did break at work I could manage to walk home bare eyed to get another pair of glasses. </p><p>I think from now on I will keep a second pair in my bag (Gemma always has a spare pair of her glasses with her, don't know why I don't) and will get up in time for work. I think a quick check in a mirror just before leaving the house is advisable. I'm now paranoid about forgetting to put something on that would be far more embarrassing than forgetting my glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2016, 01:55</p><p>Carrie.  </p><p>I think being able to see not to bump into things without glasses must be worse.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2016, 15:10</p><p>Carrie </p><p>You have been wearing glasses full time long enough not to mention that your prescription has also increased considerably over that time that I can't imagine how you could even leave your house without finding everything more than a little bit blurry. Now if you had done with your first glasses which were pretty weak and you hardly needed them to see distance. I'm sure you made the right decision of going back for them because working at the checkout would have been very tough on your eyes without glasses. You should consider taking a pair of your previous glasses and storing them someplace around work just in case you should ever break your glasses while at work or if you somehow were to ever be in such a hurry that you would run off without some morning. I know you always get 2 pairs of glasses when you get new ones but you may not want to leave them at work in case you might want to switch at home. Your previous glasses would be slightly weaker than the prescription you currently wear but they would be good enough to get you through for a day in a pinch. Not to mention really other than that they are really useless to you anyway since you wouldn't be wearing them as your everyday glasses anyway.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2016, 14:42</p><p>I overslept this morning. Gemma had already left for work and I had decided to have a few more minutes with the whole bed to myself.....and went back to sleep. I woke up again and panicked when I saw the time! I dashed around getting ready for work and ran out the door. I suddenly realised that everything wasn't looking as sharp as usual and I put my hand up to my face to discover that I had forgotten to put my glasses on. I've never done that before! I then quickly checked that I hadn't forgotten to put anything else on (thankfully I hadn't) before dashing back home and putting my glasses on and then dashing off to work again even faster than before! Luckily I got to work with a few minutes to spare but my poor little legs and feet ached for a while. If I had got all the way to work before realising that I didn't have my glasses on I would have been late by the time I had gone home and back to work. There is no way I could go without my glasses all day. Yes, I can see well enough without them to see where I am going when I'm not concentrating on what I'm looking at but my eyes will soon "complain" once I look at something properly and I certainly wouldn't be able see stuff at work properly, such as when I'm putting a customer's shopping through checkout. </p><p>I can laugh about it now but I was not at all amused this morning.</p><p></p><hr>

Yes, I did a bit of snow shoveling, so to prepare I put my drop-temples on the origami in the garage, then my husband and I got the snow away from the driveway and front door, after which I put my pretty glasses back on and went inside while the snow-thrower-blower machine did its thing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2016, 16:51</p><p>Today I had two other bareeyed episodes: one from the train station to the remote workplace (I'm on business travel) and the other in the night from the resaturant where I had dinner with colleagues to the hotel. In particular the last one was almost one hour walk in the night, along a path which I have been many years ago, but didn't remember exactly. Going bareeyed in the night is much more challenging that in the daylight, in particular finding the hotel was a nightmare! I had to turn all around the block where the hotel was supposed to be according to Google map till I passed very close to the building before recognising the entrance door. Even the name was very hard to be read since it was very high on the building and light signs in the night are just a blur of light, much harder to read that writings of teh same size in the day. It must have to do with the fact that in the night the pupils are very widely open, so the defocus is larger. In daylight, on the other hand, eyes apply some kind of automatic squinting that helps a lot in sharpening the vision.  </p><p>No problem once inside. Could also have a decent sighting: a nearsighted hostess with around -2 black and white glasses, long bloned hair... the kind of girl I could easily fall in love soon. :) </p><p>I now had several bareeyed experiences in the last months, and all of them were really succesfull. I start thinking that -3 is too low a prescription to give major problems in navigating bareeyed. I'd like to experience something more, should try with some reading glasses on to improve the blur, sooner or later... </p><p>This makes me think to a question for all of you: there are a lot of glasses addicted people here around that go GOC just to try how the life is through  glasses. I'm wondering if there could be people who tried or would try going (bespectacled or not) in the blur to see how the world of a nearsighted person is. Is this less common "addiction" than GOC? Is it just my own attitude? I'd b interested in knowing what do you think about, please share. </p><p> </p><p>P.S: I forgot to say that when I was just in front of my remote workplace, I recognised some colleagues. Too late to avoid them commenting about the fact that they thought I was refusing to say hello to them... nonetheless no one commented about the fact that I was bareeyed, they didn't notice at all that it was just due to my nearsightedness! And I just told that I was looking towards another direction to cross the road (that was only patially true...), i didn't mention my vision at all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2016, 13:08</p><p>Yennifer </p><p>Driving with glasses that sould like they aren't giving you nearly as good of vision as you really need to driving. This is very dangerous not only to you but others on the roads as well. I'm sure you don't want to be the cause of someone getting hurt or killed just because of your uncorrected eyesight. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2016, 15:36</p><p>Yennifer.   </p><p> </p><p>Oh no that sounds terrible.  I went without glasses for a week at school when my glasses got broken and I strangely got used to it.  I couldn't see to do any school work or play games but found my way about surprisingly well with a bit of help.   I do hope you get some proper glasses soon.  There are some internet sights that offer really good prices.   </p><p>C</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yennifer</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2016, 14:41</p><p>I am -6.5 in both eyes, and had my glasses knocked off me flying into traffic and they got crushed.  I don't have much money and those glasses are very expensive. </p><p> </p><p>But I had no choice.  I have been living in blur for almost 8 months now.  Yes, it is very blurry.  I try to do everything in the day.  Night isn't the worst time.  It's sunrise and sunset.  There is just enough light to really blur out many objects. </p><p> </p><p>Sunny days are good.  The computer I use at work is too blurry.  So I had to increase the font sizes and move the monitor much closer to my eyes.  Yes I miss many briefings and presentations at work, but most know I cannot see very well so they describe things to me, or give me handouts of the slides in advance. </p><p> </p><p>I have to drive.  In the earliest days after the crush, I was too nauseated and dizzy to drive.  Isn't it strange that our own vision can make us feel sick??  But I spent a couple of weeks raiding thrift stores until i found a good strong pair of glasses.  The thick ones allow me to see much better, but give me headaches so I only use them to drive. </p><p> </p><p>You might be wondering why I haven't gotten glasses yet.  After awhile you get pretty used to seeing this way.  The large school sized clock in my bedroom has been lost into blur.  I can no longer read it.  It's very hard to shop because I have to get so close to the shelves to read them.  Forget reading aisle signs, I can't squint hard enough to make them clear and read. </p><p> </p><p>I have had lots of funny experiences and mistake things for things.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2015, 13:36</p><p>Galileo, Likelenses: you are very lucky with those nearsighted girlfriends accepting to go bareeyed fro you! Did  it never happen to them to be in troubles during the bareeyedness? E.g meeting someone they know and not been able to recognise? How did they manage? It would be great if you could share! </p><p> </p><p>What you sai recalled a me a experience I had many years ago. Spent a weekend on the beach with a group of friends, including one girl who joined us for the first time. During the last dinner at the restaurant, we all noticed how close she kept the menu to her face. We asked and she explained she lost one of her contactas during the afternoon and could not suffer going around with one lens only anymore, so had to remove the other lens, too. No one paid much attention to the poor girl due to this handicap, but myself (just obsessed by eyesight and glasses at that time). At the other we had our rooms on the same fllor, but once out of the elevator, it was clear to me the poor girl was not able to read room numbers and was in troubles finding her room. She reveqled to me she was -7. I gave my help and when opened the room I told she should be happy since the moment came to put her glasses on after eyes in the blur. She reply she didn't have glasses with her so she was damned to the blur until back home! I offered my help again in the room and she accepted. The rest you can imagine, I just say it was one of the hottest nights I remember!!! And not only due to her poor eyesight... LOL </p><p>When I awoke the next morning she was already in the shower, to come out shortly with the heeled sandals of the previous night (she told could not find her slippers) and with only lace pants and bra over her slim body. She went to the mirror, squinted than turned towards me saying: "my eyes are completely bad and don't help at all, how am I doing like this?" Obviously I told her she was wonderfully ok and... we had another hot moment more!!!! </p><p>I took her and another girl at home with my car at the end of the holiday, then I haven't see her anymore since she didn't leave in our city. But I can hardly forget how sexy was the combination of her beautiful almost naked body and her nearsighted eyes that morning!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2015, 19:53</p><p>@Likelenses -I also had a -8 girlfriend about 10 years ago who  used to give me her glasses when we were out because she knew I am an O-O.  They were highly erotic  experiences for me on all levels; the trust and dependency, the vacant myopic stare, the occasional helplessness when she couldn't see something.  I still remember those occasions fondly.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2015, 17:44</p><p>Tom1 </p><p> My girl friend whose Rx ti a bit above minus nine with some astigmatism,on occasion while we are walking hand in hand or my arm around her takes off her glasses,and has me put them in my pocket. </p><p> She says it makes her feel very secure,although she also feels as though she is drunk. </p><p> I rather like it myself,as she is so trusting,and dependent on me at those times.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2015, 16:22</p><p>I read the story on a local newspaper, it happened in Rome last year, if I recall. The girl was crushed late in the night, she was coming back home from her work in a restaurant. The police found strong glasses in her bag and no sign of contacts. Her parents revealed she was severely nearsighted since years but refused to wear glasses full time since she hated them so much. After interview to the car's driver (who remained shocked for days after the accident), they concluded the girl must have fallen when she was walking on the edge of the sidewalk of the narrow street, right in front of the incoming car. </p><p>That,s all I recall. </p><p>I think it was a very unusual accident, even because no one with such a poor vision would be so brave (or silly...) to walk alone bareeyed in the night!  </p><p>Poor unlucky girl. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2015, 12:24</p><p>My experiment is at the end, Im at the airport. Glasses off as soon after returned my rental car. Finding out which gate my flight is was a little bit of a challenge. I approached the closest screens (set of LCD displays, one beside the other to follow the chronological order, rotated as portrait and placed very high). I had to squint to read (or at least to guess through the blur) the scheduled times, but didnt find my flight. Struggled a little bit more but around the expected time no writing close to what my destination city could look like in the blur. I moved my eyes around the screens to discover that was the Arrival display. Ok, lets go ahead. Getting as close as possible to the next set of screens, first checked that was for departures (label was written quite large on top of the screens). Then I started reading from the bottom lines of each screen since the topmost lines were damned far and blurred! Useless to say my flight was on the third fourth line from the top, in the blurry dark signs on white background squinting was not enough. How to manage? I recalled a trick I have never tried: pulling back the eye corner with one finger. Wow, bingo! That was really working (with my good eye, not so with the other)!!! Still very blurred and I needed to adjust the finger several times before finding for a moment the right combination and at the end I got the number. Or at least I think I got it, since I havent reached the gate yet, stopped for dinner (no problem the menu boards were really large) ;-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2015, 10:06</p><p>Tom1: pay attention in playing bareeyed. I heard months ago of a girl in Italy who was killed by a car close to the sidewalk. Apparently the poor girl felt off the sidewalk while the car was approaching and crushed her! The police reported she was very nearsighted and was walking in the night without her needed glasses... poor girl, what a sad end. Pay attention Tom!!! </p><p> </p><p>Anyway your stories are very intriguing, I alway read them with pleasure! Thanks for sharing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2015, 04:12</p><p>Little update, for those who may be interested, about my second day bareeyed (apart from driving and working). </p><p>Some episodes occurred to me this morning. </p><p> </p><p>First one was while standing at the coffee machine in the breakfast lounge of the hotel. A nice waitress approached asking for my room number and for a signature on the register. Since we were both standing up, she offered to keep the register while I was signing.I got the feeling she was holding it quite close to my face. I'm sure she didn't know anything of my eyesight, no squint or struggle since then. Maybe there are several people that have breaksfast bareeyed so she use to do so... Maybe she was also bareeyed (!)... who knows... </p><p> </p><p>Second episode was in the shop I decided to visit before going to work, to check the price of some items. On each shelf there were stacked several items and several labels below them on the shelf itself. I was a little bit puzzled and trying to figure out how to associate each item to the corresponding price while a kind hostess approached suggesting: "to find out the right price you have to compare the number on the item box with the number on the label".  </p><p>I smiled and did as she was suggesting. No problem for those items which were more or less at eye level. Unfortunately, the items I was more interested in were in the bottom shelf, with the corresponding labels almost at floor level! I crocuhed and moved as close as possible to the labels but I was barely able to see the prices (written in large font) while the item numbers (which were printed in very very small font!) were completely in the blur. Squinting did not help that much and since I could not (or didn't want) to lie on the floor to read (!) I had to give up. It was a real failure due to poor eyesight. If I had my glasses probably I would have put them on, but they were quite far, locked into the car parked 1 km away, so no hope. Other possibility could have been to ask help again to the kind hostess, but that was beyond the scope of my experiment, that is exploiting the best I can do without glasses, but still hiding the fact that I don't see a thing! So I'm trying not to ask, squint in public etc... since I don't want other people to realize I can't see a thing. </p><p> </p><p>In addition, several unexpected small accidents occurred this morning, it seems everything that could put me into new and unexpected situations occurred: low batteries on my travel electric shaver (needed to go to another shop to buy, no problem), room card de-magnetized (had to go down to the reception once more to ask, no problem again, just the regret of not having clearly seen the face of the cute receptionist, a very tall, blonde and youg girl...). </p><p> </p><p>That's it for the moment. Hope you won't find it annoying.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2015, 16:07</p><p>Another experiment bareeyed, during business travel. I put my glasses into my bag this morning and went out to take the taxi I booked yesterday evening. It was still dark outside and in the darkness the blur is really annoying! However, with my great surprise, I found I was still able to read the fare meter on the taxi dashboard (much better if squinting, sure). </p><p> </p><p>No problem in finding my way inside the airport and to the gate and finally the plane. In a couple of hours I was to my destination. Didn't fell uncomfortable, everything was very ok up to that moment. I realised my eyes ar far from perfect when the clerk asked me to sign the contract for the rental car: doable but the writing was pretty blurred. However I didn't want to be catched so I didn't get too close neither squint, just coped with the blurry words looking for something that could look like "sign here" </p><p> </p><p>At the end, I had to give up when I had to locate the car in the parking lot. As far as I could see, the number of each slot was written in small characters behind each car, on the wall, righe below the ceiling. But it was too far to be read while walking along the central aisle. Tried squinting: was just able to guess that the first digit should be a 4, while I was looking for slot nr 37. Moved two ar three slots ahead and could not read the second digit, so I couldn't realise if I was going in the right direction or not. The clerk told me the car was a white one, so I turned my head around looking for a white car. Just to discover 3/4 of the car were white! At that point I didn't have many other possibilities than putting my glasses on, and I did. I kept them on for driving and for the rest of the day at work, including dinner with a colleague. </p><p> </p><p>When I reached the hotel I again left my glasses in the car and got off the car. I walked about 1 km to the hotel (no free parking closer than that) and had also a short walk behind the hotel, to check the opening hour of a shop I'd like to visit tomorrow. Then got to my camera, where I'm right now. I'm writing on a armchair with my laptop on my knees. The sreen is pretty blurred, but I can still read from this distance, more or less. I think the key to survive witohut glasses is not triyng to put the things in focus as you would like them (by getting closer, or squinting...) but tolerate some amount of blur. If you do like this, it is very unlikely that you are catched as a walking bat, even if you are severely nearsighted. </p><p>I'll tell you tomorrow how's going, having left my glasses in the car, I'll be quite helpless for breakfast... </p><p> </p><p>I do hope others will have similar experiences to share!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2015, 10:05</p><p>You are right, I don't have intention to drive bareyed anymore since safety is the most importante thing! </p><p>However I can assure you that at least in the conditions I was this morning (sunlight, known way, low speed...) my perception of the things and people around me was absolutely good, much more than I thought. I think where driving become dangerous with my prescription is in the darkness or if you need to read signs, etc... since the reaction time may be very long. But to see people, objects, animals that could sudden appear I'm 100% sure no one would have troubles with -3 in full sunlight. The objects one may not see within, say, 50 m from the car are only the smallest ones, much smaller than people or animals. One may not see people's faces, but for sure he would perfectly see a body on or very close to the street. </p><p>Anyway I won't do again, you can all fell more than 100% safe!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2015, 07:10</p><p>Tom1 </p><p>The idea of "Going without Glasses" can be an interesting one and even fun and as you have found even somewhat challenging if you normally wear glasses all the time. But if you have been reading this thread you will notice that the one thing you shouldn't be doing is driving without your glasses for your experiment. I tried to find if you had ever posted your prescription but all I could find was where you said something about being around or over -3.00. That is far past the legal limit for being able to see well enough to drive. I urge you not only for your safety but the safety of others not to try driving anymore without your glasses. It has nothing to do with knowing where your at and not being able to read road signs, but rather your reaction time if a dog or even worse a child were to step in front of you would be greatly limited. Other than the driving enjoy going without your glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nadine</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2015, 05:45</p><p>Tom, </p><p> </p><p>I am very much into this kind of experiments, especially being new to wearing glasses. However, I dono want to sound rude  but driving is a serious thing, and legal driving requirements exist for everyone's safety. I can't stress enough how important this is since you're not only putting yourself at risk, but also others. Again, I didn't mean to offend you and I'm sure you have taken precautions, but it is concerning to know that people do this.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2015, 01:56</p><p>Amazing experience this morning! I prepared and went out of the room for breakfast without any feel for needing my eyeglasses. I felt completely confortable in the blur, I could not believe it!! It seemed my vision was perfect, I could barely notice the blur! I was really amazed, to ralise my vision was blurred I needed to explicitly think about it, wandering: "could have been better with glasses"? For sure the answer was yes, but a second later my brain did not feel any need for a correction, everything was fine even in the blur. I tried to look at people at different distance from me wandering if I could recognise in case they were known people and my feeling was that I would have been able, the blur was not affecting that much my perception of things around me, differently from yesterday, especially soon after I removed my glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Buffet breakfast was very ok. Although the table was long and full of different things, no problem in recognising food and objects around there. Just small troubles in reading the labels. There were several hot containers covered so to know what was inside (bacon, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs) I had to read labels that were written with quite small fonts. I had to get a little bit closer to table with my face, but I think this was not that noticeable for people around me. Squinting a little bit helped a lot. </p><p> </p><p>Then was the time of taking my car and driving to the workplace, few kilometers away. I sit in the the car and had a look around in the parking lot, no problem to see other cars, people etc... I decided to give it a try. When I was approaching the stree the trafic light was ok within my range, as well the other cars, people crossing the road etc... I take all my courage and went ahead like that. No problem. Vision was clear more than enough for the purpose. Speed limit signs needed some squint to be read before it was too late. I knew the way (driven the same way yesterday bespectacled) so I didn't need to read sign with street names and directions (those were badly burred until I was very very close). Went slowly ahead... and when I got to the parking lot of my workplace... glasses were still on the dashboard!!!!! Amazing, I could not imagine things could have been so clear even without correction.  </p><p>Differently from yesterday, I felt very comfortable despite the blur. I think this is confirmation that vision is a complex process which require much more than a camera. And even if the camera is defocused (nearsighted eyes) the processor (brain) can compensate very very well! For sure I would never dream of driving bareeyed in an unknown place or in the night, that would be really dangerous. And I don't know if I will do again. But in the daylight (it is very sunny here today) and in a known place, I felt perfectly comfortable. I could see everything around me with enough details (crossings, lights, people walking or crossing) to feel perfectly ok. </p><p> </p><p>Yesterday I was wandering how people can withstand such an amount of blur, especially before having his/her eyes checked for the first time (in fact I know several people who had their first eye check when their prescription was close to mine or even more). This morning I can understand this may happen: if you are used to, it is not that hard to cope with this amount of blur.  </p><p> </p><p>Which was your prescription at your first eye check? Did you soon get glasses or still resisted? Is there someone who resisted up to a significant amount of blur? How long?</p><p></p><hr>

There was a video post sometime back, on this site if I can recall, about a college guy who tried a similar experiment for the better part of a week.  If I recall, his Rx was similar to yours.  Its always interesting to me to envision how other people see without their correction. Hope you share more if you continue this experience.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;09 Sep 2015, 10:38</p><p>I'm in a business travel abroad and decided to perform a bareyed experiment, spending as much time as I can without my eyeglasses!  </p><p> </p><p>I started this morning and removed glasses just after parked my scooter in the airport's lot. All the time bareeyed since when I had to drive my rental car after the flight. As usual, I felt a little bit lost soon after removed the correction, I felt as I lost in some way perception of what was around me, a little bit afraid of not being completely aware of what was happening around me.  </p><p>Although my nearsightedness is not strong, the amount of blur is enough for making me unable to answer to a lot of questions that inconsciously come to my mind: what will be that sign? who is that person? is it a man or a woman? However, I soon realised that all the details providing answers to such questions were not needed for what I had to do: reaching a gate, get on the plane. finding my seat, getting off, reach the rental car desk and parking. No problems in doing this although I could not say which shops there were in the airport, where the plane in the gate beside my one was going, was those person with a short skirt a girl or an old woman, etc... all things that I could have easily managed with my glasses on. It is amazing how much one is used to details that are of no relevance. As usual when I spent some time without glasses, when I came out of the plane I was much more sure, the initial afraid was disappeared and I felt very ok and behaved normally despite the blur, almost I didn't feel I needed glasses to see more than I could actually see bareeyed.  </p><p> </p><p>I have to report just two embarassing situations, where probably people around me realised I could not see that much. The fist one was when I arrived in the airport and had to check the gate number on the screen. I approached the screen and there were other people looking to the same screen. I tried to read from where they were but the screen was completely blurred, no way to read a  single word, just blurry coloured lines on a dark screen. I waited for the other people to move away and slowly went closer and closer until I could read. When I got the information, I turned my head behind and realised there were other people much behind me who was waiting for me to move in order to read the screen (I'm quite tall and the screen was just a little above my face level on the wall). I Did not realise how close to the screen I was to read! </p><p> </p><p>The second and even more embarassing situation was at the arrival airport, when I decided to eat something and moved towards a Burger King restaurant. I stopped in line in a queue and was obviously unable to read a single thing on the menu. As soon as I was moving towards the desk, I was checking the menu from time to time but the blur remained strong, too strong to read something. I was sure to be able to read the menu while reached the desk, but when my turn arrived, even at the shortest possible distance the menu was still very blurred. Since usually (when I see thanks to my glasses!) I like to taste specialties instead of standard burgers, I didn't realise I was putting myself into troubles doing the same bareeyed, and in the extreme hope of coming out from that embarassing situation I badly squint at the menu. This way I could figure out some words, but the rest was still demanded to "imagination". It would have been too long to figure out completely what specialties there were, so I ended ordered the standard Whopple Burger. How silly I was! Any other person used to the blur would have ordered the same burger without trying to read the menu at all! The only result I obtained with my squinting was to clearly pass to the cute girl at the desk the message: "hey, look how nearsighted I am, I cannot read a thing even from so close!". </p><p> </p><p>Finally, when I arrived at the hotel I left the glasses in the car and easily managed without. Again, I walked through a long an large aisle with tables, chairs and armchairs along both sides. And from time to time a meeting room door with people going in and out. Again it was natural for me to look around trying to see details, but I couldn't, since everything was very blurred. Strange  looking at people without seeing faces, looking at objects without understanding what they are, looking at signs without reading what is written... basically I can see everything even bareeyed (people, objects, signs), but I can't figure out any detail. </p><p> </p><p>I'm going to have dinner with a colleague and I'm not so brave to go bareeyed since she very well know I wear glasses and has alway seen me with glasses. I think I will resume my bareeyed experience tomorrow. And will update you, in the hope I've not been too verbose and boring for you to read!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2015, 15:22</p><p>The beach is a wonderful place for bareeyed experiences. Whenever you see a gwg coming (even with prescription sunglasses) and then you see her bathing or going around bareeyed, you are sure she is not seeing well! And sooner or later you will see her struggling, squinting, asking... I love the beach and the opportunity it provides to discover so many people going around bareeyed. Including me. I can understand people not wearing glasses regularly even with a prescription of -3 or more. I'm in that range and I doubt anyone can realize I don't see e.g. when I remove glasses for a bath. I don't have any trouble going bareeyed, although signs can't be read, friends must be recognised by their swimsuit or hair (sure not from their face!) etc. It's amazing to me every time I take off glasses to realize how details are most often unnecessary and one can easily do without seeing them.</p><p></p><hr>

I CAN SEE. maybe not 20/20 but can see enough. We are dating for a while, have you ever seen me walking into walls?!?" </p><p>"let's keep it short: ok for the cinema but please don't wear them in public. Never wear in public when there is someone I know around!" </p><p>I felt very empathic with the poor shortsighted girl. Had opportunity to see her momentarily alone at the exit of the cinema and I took oportunity to compliment on her glasses (although she removed promply before lights were on at the end of the movie) and sked for prescription: -3.75. Not bad for going without glasses! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

It was kind of sunny, but I didn't expect it to be that sunny. The sun got so bad I put on some non-prescription sunglasses. My vision was worse than I expected. I have 20/30 vision without glasses, but things were noticeably blurred. I also had some pretty bad double vision. I also got a bit dizzy. Guess I need glasses fulltime despite my 20/30 vision. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jason</b>&nbsp;22 May 2015, 19:22</p><p>Hi guys, </p><p> </p><p>End of relaxing 2 days.   </p><p>Actualy i think now her eye sight has been fully dependant on glasses and she is ok with the near as well as far sight with glases.. when she remove glases ,  for near work she has to come like 6 inches minimum near the paper and far is total blur to her.  </p><p>Yes. We didnt buy sunglases . But she took her prevous sunglases which doesnt have any prescriptin.  And i saw that she tried to wear them several times but only for few seconds and remove it and put glases. She couldnt wear those finaly. </p><p>For swiming though she removed glases in every 30 mnts she goes out of the pool and put glases and sat for sun bath.  And also when she was in the pool she was tring to squint to find me bt seems it is nt helping her.   How ever after one and half hour she had headache without glases in the pool. </p><p>For the first time she wore glasses for sex :-)  it was a great accocsory on her. </p><p>In our way home we gave to make prescriptin glases to her.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 May 2015, 13:01</p><p>jason </p><p>She is wasting her money by buying non prescription sunglasses. For this trip she really needs to buy a sunglasses clip that fits on her glasses. That way she will be blocking the sun and also able to see things clearly. Now when she goes in the water she doesn't need her glasses in order to swim. Things will be blurry but she should be able to see what shes doing well enough without her glasses.  </p><p>Once she is convinced that these glasses provide her with perfect vision she should probably consider getting prescription sunglasses for driving and at the pool.  </p><p>Her vision isn't quite as bad as -2.75. You only add half of the astigmatism values to her distance. So her right eye is closer to -2.25 and her left eye is somewhere between -2.25 and -2.50. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 May 2015, 12:51</p><p>Melyssa </p><p>No doubt your doctor is taking very good care of your eyes and every doctor should do the same.

Im curious to know what wil hapen there for swimming, activity which she likes most and in our private time together with bad eye sight. I will update in evening what hapend and how her eyes now.  </p><p>Thank you</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;21 May 2015, 11:35</p><p>Since the first eye exam I remember having, the one that meant that I had to start wearing glasses 51 years ago, through my most recent eye exam last year, I have always, with no exceptions, had my eyes dilated early on after some preliminary activities.  Following that I would have to wait 15-30 minutes in the waiting area, dabbing that gunk off with tissue, after which the exam would resume, and my new/old/same prescription would be determined with my eyes wide open. </p><p> </p><p>The most difficult part is afterwards, when everything is so bright for a number of hours, and I cannot watch TV, read, or use the computer as my eyesight is affected at all distances.  My husband drives me to and from my annual eye exam as we go home into the sun and even my shades aren't enough to dim the bright light.  (The weather always seems to be perfect on those days.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 May 2015, 08:07</p><p>jason </p><p>Honestly I think if it were my gf and this would have happened to her I would probably be suggesting she see a different doctor in the future. I'm sure when she went in 20 months ago to get her eyes examined they had her fill out a sheet and somewhere on there it should have asked when she had her last eye exam? I would assume it could have quite sometime if she wasn't having any vision problems until then. So if it was anything more than 2 years before then the doctor should have dilated her eyes to get a more accurate exam and a better refraction. In other words her first glasses most likely needed to be stronger than what she was prescribed. But at first i'm sure your gf thought her glasses were perfect because they did help her see the board at school better. But because they were too weak as soon as her eyes adjusted to them and her eyes were made a little more relaxed with her glasses then she was having problems not seeing clearly. Even worse when she returned in such a short time unable to see properly he still didn't dilate her eyes on the 2nd or 3rd visit for some reason. And he really didn't increase her prescription very much at all. I am quite certain that your gf doesn't need bifocals, maybe in 20 years she will, but not now. The reason her close vision is a bit blurry is for 2 reasons. In small her eyes still are feeling the effects of the dilation, but more so because her prescription made a sizable jump from the previous glasses she had been wearing. If you had asked her shortly after she got her new glasses she would have told you that her distance was super intense and very clear and sharp but things looked smaller. But that feeling is probably already gone and her distance should be very good now. But with stronger glasses it takes a little while for her eyes to overcome the blur for close up, but she seems to be getting there okay as well.  </p><p>Like Michael said now that she decided to put her glasses on at the wedding and her biggest fears were put to rest about what others would think of her wearing glasses. Getting those complements was the best thing that could happen. Now she has to feel more self confident about wearing glasses. And with so many of her friends seeing her in glasses she has nothing to hide anymore.    </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;20 May 2015, 18:53</p><p>Jason </p><p>  In following all of the posts regarding your girl friend,there are a few possibilities with regard to her close vision. The first is that depending of which drops they put in her eyes,and there are several types in use,she could be under the after effects for up to a few weeks,but that is rare.It is more likely due to her prescription change.Her right eye has a fairly high change in the sphere,and her left has a hefty cylinder.This is enough to cause print to appear so much smaller now through the new glasses. </p><p>  Has she commented if the print looks very small,or does she say it is truly blurred? You may want to ask her to compare each eye.Also does she have an urge to bring the printed material closer,or farther from her eyes,in order to see it more clearly?To the myopic eye,the print appears larger than what it actually is,and that is what her brain is used to seeing,but now with lenses that are twice as strong the print is even smaller,and some myopes have trouble getting used to it. </p><p>  Since her first prescription was a bit strong,and the latest is twice as powerful.it would not surprise me if in the next three years she would be at -4.00 with a fairly larger cylinder. For first glasses at her age,she has what is called adult onset myopia.It never gets as high as myopia that comes on at a younger age,but she will have fairly strong glasses,that she will be wearing full time,as you are seeing now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;20 May 2015, 11:51</p><p>Jason </p><p> </p><p>Wow! What an exciting day you did have today. I think we learned something. That your girl friend has no choice now but wear her glasses full time. Both Soundmanpt and I told you that. I think she realizes that now too.It seems that she already knew that she had to do that based on the fact that she has worn them almost full time for the last few months. And didn't you tell us after the exam before this one the doctor advised her to wear them full time as well? I think she realized that she sees much better with her glasses than without so that is why she wore her glasses most of the day. But I don't still think she thought of herself as a full time glasses wearer because she felt she could get away without wearing them at times especially at social functions. I really think she thought she could manage today going to the wedding without wearing her glasses. But she ran into more problems than she or even you probably could have anticipated. And it is a good thing you brought her glasses with you. Because if she did not have her glasses she would have likely run into more problems. Whether she likes it or not I think she knows now that she has to wear her glasses full time and by full time that means from the time she gets up in the morning until the time she goes to bed. Which means at weddings, parties and dinners.But now she should be over the hurdle of not wearing her glasses at social functions because she had to do it today and her friends saw her wearing glasses and were very complimentary which I was sure they would be. Now I think it should be a non issue when you and her go out someplace socially. I don't think she will have anymore problems wearing her glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I guess I did not misunderstand you when you talked about the doctor. I was always under the assumption it was the same doctor for all 4 eye exams. And the same thing about her being checked for her close vision. It seemed that you were telling us that she wasn't and that is what I thought as well. But based on what you are telling us today it seems that Soundmanpt might turn out to be correct that the doctor finally got her script right this time. Her vision close up doesn't seem nearly as blurry today as it was yesterday with her glasses which is a good sign. </p><p> </p><p>But if it doesn't clear up completely in the next few days I don't think I would go back to this doctor again. I would definitely try a different one. A couple of things about the doctor would really concern me. One is why did the doctor wait until the 4th eye exam to give her a dilated one? It might have been OK not to do one the first time but if she was complaining that she wasn't seeing well with her glasses one should have been done on either the 2nd or 3rd one. And why was her close vision not checked? Even if she had no complaints and she is young I think it still should have been checked. 4 exams in 20 months is a little too much. I would never give anybody a doctor or a car repair place or anybody else 4 chances to get something right.  </p><p> </p><p>I think at the first three exams she was under prescribed because they were not dilated exams so your girl friend was probably able to fake the doctor into thinking she could see better than she actually can.And I bet you find it hard to believe how dependent she has become on her glasses in such a short period of time? I think she started out wearing them just to see the board in school and for little else. Now you tell us she was wearing them just sitting in the bathtub. But her ability to not be able to read well without her glasses is interesting because her glasses are for distance and astigmatism. My guess for that is that her astigmatism is now at a level where it affects her ability to see close up.That is why if her close up vision does not clear up in the next few days I would go to a different doctor because there may be something else going on that the other doctor did not pick up on.If at that point she continues have problems reading with her glasses then it is possible she needs a reading add in her glasses as well.But I am cautiously optimistic that this doctor finally got it right although it should never take 4 chances to get something right. But continue to keep us updated about how she is doing.                  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 May 2015, 11:29</p><p>jason </p><p>Oh, okay so all 4 of her eye exams have been with the same doctor, but it wasn't until her 4th visit that he finally dilated her eyes? Yeah I think you maybe right then in having her change doctors next time. But now that she has had her eyes dilated and has her new glasses you should allow sometime to see how she gets along before jumping ship and getting yet another eye exam done.  </p><p>I can't say if he did or didn't check her close vision, but I honestly don't think in her case it is that necessary. Her eyes had some change in astigmatisms and that effects her vision not only for distance but close up as well. Also her distance vision changed quite a bit so her glasses are stronger now so that is why seeing close right now is still a little bit blurry for her. But just like she noticed this morning when she first put her glasses on and tested her eyes on seeing her calendar she said it was better than yesterday but still a little bit blurry. After she wears her glasses over the next few days that remaining blur will go away and she will be able to see close up perfect with her glasses on.  </p><p>Somehow I wasn't at all surprised that she attempted to go without glasses at her friends wedding. But she was clearly struggling to see things and still couldn't see them. But she was smart enough with some encouragement to put her glasses on and stop resisting. And just as i predicted she was greeted with many complements on how good she looks wearing glasses. That should go a along way now with giving her confidence to wear them full time now. If she is able to see good with her glasses I think she won't object to wearing her glasses now and they will become very comfortable for her as well. Tomorrow if you ask her i think she will find that her close vision is even better and the blur could even be gone completely. I'm sure she knows you care about her and her eyes so she will probably tell you how she is seeing things with her glasses. but with each passing day as her get more and more adjusted to her glasses her vision without her glasses is going get more and more blurry which is very normal.  </p><p>You must be pretty happy because you were wanting her to start wearing her glasses full time all along anyway. It would seem you got your wish. </p><p>   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jason</b>&nbsp;20 May 2015, 09:33</p><p>Hi </p><p>Please note that all the previous 4 times we went to a same eye doctr. Thats why i want to change the doctr now. </p><p>And also he didnt check her close vision too. </p><p>Today morning as soon as she got up she was searchng for a pair of glases. Actualy last night i kept it on a table in the other side of the bed . She couldnt see that. I couldnt belive it.  I gave her the glasses and she put them on. Then she cheked her vision by reading the calander by sitting in the bed and told me still its little blur. But better than yesterday. It was better than yesterday. Bt it was dificult for her. Then i  took her glasses when we were cuddling and and put in my face. Oh god. It was very dificult to focus. And also she told that without glasses full calander is a black blob now for her and she took frm my face and put again in her face. </p><p>Even she went for the bath  she had her glasses on when she was in the bath tub even.  I thnk she didnt take it out frm the face until she was doing the make up.   </p><p>I was very upset to see how she was trying to make up . She was struggling a lot.:-(  </p><p>With glases she couldnt put make up and when she remove she couldnt see. Finaly i helped her. </p><p>Bt she told me she won't put any glases  for the weding. She knew it wil be dificult.  How i told her just check what glases will suit her best with the dress.  It was definitly black framed glasses .  She told then that she is not takin any bag or smethng. So she told me to keep it with me. Frm that moment i knew she is strugglin. As soon as we went to the main road she askd me for the glases  by saying she couldnt see anythng.  I told wait like that until we reach thre so that eyes will get used to the blur. Bt she kept in her face for 10 mnts and gave it back to me.  We went to the weding hall and it was dark and with several clours of lights. First she missed a step. I knew that it is becuse she couldnt see.  We sat on a table and one tble in frnt of her best frend was there. She never recognisd her frm a distance like 5 meters. She was wawing and my girl also waved. After that she is asking frm me who is that :-( </p><p>Even they have decorated the walls with lights with shape of hearts. She was asking me is it a big lght.  There was like 10 lights there. Then i went to the wash r00m with her and told that this not g00d and i gave her to put her glases. Reluctantly she put them on her face and went to the table.  Then everythng was ok and all her frinds gave good compliments to her. Until she went to bed she had glases today also. It was an end of a exciting day. :-) </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

So if she gets up and starts her day by putting on her glasses on first thing I think she will see even better than she did yesterday. Even her close up eyesight should be somewhat better. Just remember her eyes are still adjusting and it can take a several days for everything to become perfectly clear for her. It sounds like she kept her glasses on from the time she got them until she fell asleep with them on and you had to remove them for her. You and her will be attending her friends wedding later today. This will be a big test for her. Can she accept the fact that she now really needs to be wearing her glasses all the time and that includes weddings, parties or just going out for dinner. Do most of her friends even know that she has glasses? Trust me if she goes wearing her glasses she will be happy with all the complements she will receive about how she looks wearing glasses. Every woman loves being complemented. </p><p>Those complements will go a along way in helping make her wearing glasses much more comfortable for her.  </p><p>You mentioned getting yet another doctor to exam her eyes because you don't like this last doctor. Just a suggestion, I think this last doctor maybe was the best that has examined her eyes of all of them. I think she actually now has the correct prescription that her eyes need and she will be able to see better, with glasses, than she has with any of her previous glasses. He did his job the right way by dilating her eyes so her eyes were in a complete relaxed state. I think her new glasses should give her very good vision for a good while and she shouldn't need a change in her glasses for about a year now.  </p><p>Maybe after she sees that her glasses are really helping her you may want to gift her with a nice pair of prescription sunglasses for sunny days when she may wish she could wear sunglasses.  </p><p>So I can't wait to her how she is doing with </p></body></html>
