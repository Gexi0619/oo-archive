<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;08 May 2016, 06:00</p><p>Julie </p><p> </p><p>It is an unacceptable practice, for that doctor to discard your glasses. Even if the glasses is unnecessary or does not perform correctly, your glasses is your private property. she needs your consent before donating your glasses away without your consent. </p><p> </p><p>That doctor is so bad , it looks like she thought oh -0.5 was not a high rx , but after she record so much data about acuity she did not seem to have a second thought on that </p><p>   </p><p>There are indication on that sheet. DVA stands for Distance visual acuity. your uncorrected acuity  20/25+3 which should be considered as 20/30  compared with corrected acuity (DVA) of 20/15.  it is not only a slight difference on distance visual acuity . it is not uncorrected 20/15 with corrrected 20/15 .  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2015, 07:20</p><p>Some more poor typing on my part. that should start out "Like the others have said"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2015, 07:14</p><p>Julie </p><p>Like the bothers said I too am glad they were able to find your glasses for you. You were really lucky they found them.  </p><p>So you went back to the place you went to 2 years ago in the mall to get your eyes examined? And the outcome of that exam turned out to be exactly the same as it was 2 years ago? So you found out several things anyway. First of all that other doctor did a very poor job of examining your eyes. Also if there hasn't been any change in your vision for the past 2 years your eyes must be pretty stable now and likely won't be changing until later on when you may start to find a need for bifocals. And it never hurts to have 2 pairs of glasses to change into for a change in looks. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2015, 15:04</p><p>Thank you for your responses.  It is nice to have a choice.  I really like both frames.  I wore my new glasses to school today.  ( I am a teacher in an elementary school.). My students noticed right off the bat and said that they approved.  I also. Got nice compliments from several people that I teach with.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2015, 04:28</p><p>Julie, </p><p> </p><p>I'm glad everything worked out for the best with your original glasses.  And it never hurts to have a spare pair or 50.  :)  I always carry several pairs with me; granted I do wear 6-7 pairs a day.  With the same prescription, you can alternate glasses by day, or wear one at work and the other elsewhere, or one in the morning and one after noon, etc.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>antonio</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2015, 16:53</p><p>really nice to hear Julie,  </p><p> </p><p>how strong are they and do you plan to wear them and if so whatfor ?  </p><p> </p><p>best regards,  </p><p> </p><p>   antonio</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2015, 16:27</p><p>I would like to thank all of the nice people on here.  I have my glasses back.  Unfortunately, I got the message as my other glasses were being made after my appointment.  I have two pairs of glasses now.  The new pair has the same prescription as my old pair.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2015, 17:27</p><p>After reading this yesterday, I decided to bite the bullet and go to the place in the mall that I went to two years ago.  I have an appointment tomorrow afternoon after I get off of work.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 May 2015, 07:41</p><p>Julie </p><p>Being a member of a Lion's Club I hate to tell you but the chances of them finding your glasses now is very remote. I know because I have been picking up the donated glasses myself for many years. When I make my pick ups I have about 35 locations I pick up from and I try to hit all 35 locations within a couple days around the same time each month. So some locations may only have a few in the box (10 - 20), but others may have 40 - 50. So I had a rather big box in my car and would dump what i picked up in the big box so by the end of the day i would have several hundred pairs of glasses in the larger box. Even worse if the person that works in that area goes directly to the main drop off point now they will be mixed in with collections from all over town and it could be many hundreds there.   </p><p>At this point I think you should demand that she compensate you in some way. Maybe see if she will refund you the cost of the eye exam you got. Anything would be better than nothing. You seemed to know what the prescription was in your glasses that she decided to donate. My suggestion is since you felt like your vision was still quite good with those glasses I can help you order a nice pair of quality glasses from Zenni. You have well over 800 women's glasses to choose from for under $22.00. The site is zennioptical.com and the price I gave you is fro a complete pair of glasses including the AR coating (anti-reflective)I have ordered several hundred pairs of glasses from them in the past 11 years or so. I can help you with making sure you get the proper size glasses that fit your face well. Honestly it is really very easy and you will have your glasses within 2 weeks time. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;30 May 2015, 06:56</p><p>Thank you all for your advice and support.  Alas however, the Lion's Club had come by that morning to collect the glasses that were donated.  The doctor said that she would contact the club to see if the glasses could be returned.  I sent off an e-mail also but have not heard back from either this week.  I wasn't especially pleased with how the doctor discussed my request in front of a room full of patients in the waiting room.  That is another story though. </p><p> </p><p>I hope that you all have a fantastic weekend.  Thanks again!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maurice</b>&nbsp;25 May 2015, 14:58</p><p>Julie, this is really a strange story.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;24 May 2015, 21:07</p><p>Julie, </p><p> </p><p>Go demand your glasses back. Donating old glasses to Lions is voluntary. Taking them from you is theft. They are your private property.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 May 2015, 01:17</p><p>Miku, </p><p>You need to supply the PD when you order glasses online.  Your PD is pretty easy to measure if you don't know it.  Some people can see well enough without glasses to make the measurement, but others need someone to help them. </p><p>Could you provide your complete prescription?  That would help me suggest an appropriate method of making the measurement. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>miku</b>&nbsp;24 May 2015, 00:30</p><p>Thank you, Cactus Jack! </p><p> </p><p>I am a little worried, because I always got glasses online. I became a little paranoid when my PD reading showed 59, 61 and 63 on different occasions.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;23 May 2015, 23:23</p><p>Miku, </p><p>Yes, but it depends on the difference between what the PD should be and if it is too much or too little.  Incorrect PD causes Induced Prism in the glasses and is often used for small prism corrections. </p><p>The actual amount of Induced Prism depends on several factors.  Look up Prentice's Rule for the details. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>miku</b>&nbsp;23 May 2015, 14:46</p><p>Hello again, </p><p> </p><p>I apologise if my question comes across as a little stupid, but does getting glasses with the wrong PD affect the health of my eyes? I mean, would it hurt the muscles or deviate my eyes and cause strabismus? </p><p> </p><p>Thank you!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;23 May 2015, 12:32</p><p>Thank you so much for your explanations and advice.  I really, really appreciate it. </p><p> </p><p>I will go and try to retrieve my glasses after work on Tuesday.  I think that she will be closed for Memorial Day on Monday if I remember a sign in her office correctly.  I hope that they are still there. </p><p> </p><p>Pseudomyopia?  Did she think that I was pretending to need my glasses?  I really do see better with them on. </p><p> </p><p>Thank you again and I hope that you have a fantastic weekend.  I will let you know if I get my glasses back.  </p><p> </p><p>Answering your other question, I teach first grade and I live in New York State in the United States.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;22 May 2015, 21:51</p><p>Julie </p><p>  I strongly agree with the others here,that the doctor had no right to take your glasses,and donate them. If I were you,I would demand their return,and if they are not available,demand that the doctor provide you with a pair for free. </p><p>  Now,about the test numbers.It looks like the first few sets may be the eye chart numbers you read,and also the ones you missed. This could have been a computer generated analysis by an autorefractor. </p><p>  The thing that I find most interesting is that some of the latter numbers show a small minus ,and small cylinder correction,and then later numbers appear that a small plus correction is required while your eyes were dilated. </p><p>  I believe that the final analysis is that you have a small amount of pseudo myopia due to close work,and they are suggesting plus lenses for reading to help with that. </p><p>  I think that because of this part of your test. </p><p>  </p><p>C1. Dilation Time: 1:35 PM </p><p> </p><p>CRx: </p><p> </p><p>OD: +0.25 </p><p> </p><p>OS: +0.50 </p><p> </p><p>Dx: DV- WNL, D/C WRxGl STAT, PsoM, Emmotrope, F/U 2 yrs.  </p><p>  </p><p>Notice the notation PsoM,Emmotrope, F/U 2 yrs </p><p> I believe that means pseudo myopia,and Emmotrope means normal distance vision,and then they want you to have a follow up exam. in two years. </p><p> If I am correct,you would have better,and more comfortable distance vision,with your old glasses,especially since you are used to them,even more reason to demand their return,or replacement of their prescription.BTW, I would select a very expensive frame when demanding replacement glasses,if they can not produce your original ones.If they refuse threaten then with a report to an optometrist ethics board,and The Better Business Bureau.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;22 May 2015, 20:03</p><p>Julie and Soundmanpt, </p><p>It looks like you (Julie) had a very through eye exam and there is a lot of information there to establish a vision and overall health base line.  Many silent health problems are first noticed on an eye exam.  Frankly, I don't fully understand some of the abbreviations, but it appears that you and your eyes are healthy. </p><p>Based on your Date of Birth, you are in your early 30s and it is unlikely that Presbyopia will be of much concern for a few more years, but as a teacher,  you use your eyes a lot for close work.  At some point some functional close help may be useful for comfort.  You can get some low cost, low power (+1.00) clip on magnifier/readers, to make extended close work more comfortable.  We can tell you where to get them. </p><p>I agree that you should demand your glasses back.  They belong to you and the ECP had no right to forcefully "donate" them to any cause, no matter how noble. </p><p>I believe your refracted Rx, which gave you slightly better than 20/20 with both eyes was: </p><p>OD: -0.50  </p><p>OS: plano x -0.50 110 </p><p>Even with this low prescription, it indicates that your vision is quite good out to about 2 meters or nearly 7 feet, but I believe you really need to be to see what is going on at the back of the class room, effortlessly. </p><p>Classroom vision is a two way street, if a student required this prescription, they would likely need glasses unless they were seated on the first row.  A teacher needs to see the entire classroom with excellent vision all the way to the back. </p><p>I am not certain, but I believe your existing glasses Rx was: </p><p>OD: -0.50  </p><p>OS: plano </p><p>If new glasses were to be purchased from a Main Street Optical Shop, for several hundred dollars, I would not recommend it.  There simply is not enough difference to justify spending that much money.  A new pair from an online retailer such as Zenni, might be worth the low cost, particularly if you want a new frame style.  I would suggest at least the low cost Anti-Reflective coating, but no other options until you find out if they suit your needs.  </p><p>Actually, Zenni's $6.95 glasses are of such quality and so reasonably priced, I would be tempted to order a pair just to see if I liked the optical difference and also learn how to order my own glasses.  If you like the results, you can order any frames and options you like and still save a ton of money.  We'll help you do that also if you wish.  Soundmanpt has considerable experience in Optical retailing and has ordered many pairs of glasses from Zenni with good results.  I have also ordered glasses from Zenni, but Soundmanpt is the expert.  Either of us can tell you how to easily measure your PD, which is the only other number you will need to order glasses.  Traditionally, the Eye Care Professional (ECP) does not furnish the PD.  Normally, the dispensing optical shop does that when they order the glasses made. </p><p>I hope all this helps.  Please let us know what you decide to do and don't hesitate to ask more questions if you wish. </p><p>May I ask where you live and what grades and subjects you teach? </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 May 2015, 18:08</p><p>Julie </p><p>Are you kidding me? She really did that? That takes quite a bit of nerve to do that. I guess you were stunned. The irony of that is at least they went to a good cause because I am a member of my local Lion's Club and have been for years. </p><p>But even if your glasses were only -.50 in both eyes that is still enough to make a difference in your vision and if your driving at night even more so. Honestly if I were you I would go straight back in there and tell her you want your glasses out of the box locked or unlocked. If she needs to call the person that put the box in so be it and while your there ask for a simple written prescription not that information sheet she gave you. But it's not right that you may have to wait 2 years now just to get any glasses.  </p><p>If you can ever get her to provide you with a REAL prescription we can help you buy glasses on line for less than $20.00 and very nice as well. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;22 May 2015, 17:34</p><p>Thank you so much for responding again.  Btw, I hope that your impending surgery goes well.  I just saw that.   </p><p> </p><p>At the end of my exam, she told me that my glasses were unnecessary and deposited them in a clear plastic Lion's Club donation box that had a little padlock locking the top opening.  I thought that was really nervy but at that point I was stunned.  I don't have any glasses to wear. </p><p> </p><p>Thank you again and may all go well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 May 2015, 16:44</p><p>Julie </p><p>That is one of the most confusing prescriptions I have ever seen. But the one thing that is clear none of the numbers are much at all from what I can tell. Maybe "Cactus Jack" can better understand it than I can. My best guess is your just a little bit nearsighted based on the O.D. -.50 and the O.S. -.50 I see. There are some other numbers down lower that might indicate a very slight plus prescription for close up, but it is so weak I doubt it would make any difference in your vision. For the time being if you have glasses and they seem to work for distance then I would continue wearing them and with your doing close work take your glasses off. That is as good as wearing a weak reading prescription just doing that.  </p><p>Otherwise you might want to return and ask her to write out your prescription in simple terms. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;22 May 2015, 14:18</p><p>I absolutely disagree with the doctor.  It is true that I could see okay without glasses but my vision was a lot better with my glasses.  She said that she could prescribe computer glasses for close work but I wore glasses for distance.  That make no sense.  I don't think she knew what she was doing.  My insurance will not pay for another appointment for another two years now.  I should have gone back to the place in the mall instead of seeing her.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 May 2015, 09:32</p><p>Julie </p><p>Just as "Likelenses" said no one here can help you unless you post the numbers or verbage on the printout you received. Also you said this doctor didn't agree with your previous doctor, but I assume you must have gotten glasses based on that doctors prescription? Your the best one to tell how well you were able to see with the glasses you got as the result of that exam. Also it might be helpful if you can provide what the problems your having with your vision that seems to be causing different opinions from different doctors. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;16 May 2015, 19:25</p><p>Julie  </p><p>  If you tell us what is on the printout,we can explain it to you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;16 May 2015, 12:15</p><p>I had my eyes examined yesterday and I am confused.  I questioned the doctor's diagnosis and she said that she that she thoroughly examined my eyes and that her diagnosis was correct.  She questioned the previous doctor that I had seen previously.  She seemed upset and had the receptionist give me a printout of my exam and told me to go ahead and get a second opinion but the result would be the same. </p><p> </p><p>I don't understand the printout.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2011, 12:02</p><p>country girl, </p><p>Image size reduction primarily applies to glasses and is caused by what is called Vertex Distance which is the distance from the front of the cornea to the back of the glasses lens.  Contact lenses have a Vertex Distance of Zero.  Image size reduction does not particularly affect acuity until you get into very high minus Rx.  The reason for this is that the retina has many millions of rods and cones (light sensors) so a small reduction has little almost no effect.  Curiously, many people like to be slightly over corrected because the images seem sharper. </p><p>You will see best if the astigmatism is accurately corrected.  Glasses provide the best correction and you really want it corrected.  Contacts are different.  Sometimes, a compromise sphere only contact lens Rx is used to avoid toric contact lenses, which have their own set of problems.  The compromise is to increase the sphere by 1/2 the cylinder.  Sphere only contacts only come in 0.25 diopter increments in your Rx range.  Toric contacts are not available with cylinder less than -0.75. </p><p>Your optician probably used a trial frame and there is probably a tiny knob on the outside edge of each lens holder that is used to adjust the axis. </p><p>You didn't mention where you live, but opticians in some countries tend to under correct.  It seems to be pretty common in the UK.  If you think you are slightly under corrected, you can get a new exam and order the glasses on line with a slightly stronger Rx, we can tell you how. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>country girl</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2011, 10:32</p><p>thanks cactus jack for replying back, this is the first time i have posted a question on here.  </p><p> </p><p>I have read somewhere that the image size is reduced by 2% for every 1 dioptre of prescription, so in the eye that I am not seeing as well out of, does the reduction in image size only play a arole with glasses and is it minimised or eliminated when wearing contacts seeing as they are right on your eye?  if so, would the approx 6% make so much of a difference combined with the potentially off astigmatism correction account for why i cant see the 6/6 line? </p><p> </p><p>Also at the next test, am i able to request the optician not to put any astigmatism correction in , or is that not an acceptable thing to do? I know that they are qualified in diagnosing and correcting eye defects but if i feel that i could see better without that astigmatism correction, do i have any input as a patient?  </p><p> </p><p>im not quite sure what you mean by placing my own hand on a dial of some sort , as the last test i had i had those big glasses frame put on my face and he was doing all the lens moving.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2011, 19:58</p><p>country girl, </p><p>It is easily possible that the astigmatism in your glasses is not right.  Low astigmatism correction is very hard to prescribe because its accuracy depends on your skill more than the skill of the optician.  I know it sounds funny, but to get it right, you have to be able to judge relative degrees of blurriness.  Letter with straight lines make that hard to do.  I usually do two things.  One, concentrate on an "O" if possible.  Also, I ask the examiner if he/she will let me fine tune the axis for sharpness at the appropriate time.  Often they will place your hand on the axis adjusting knob and you can move it back and forth a few degrees - like fine tuning an old TV - for the sharpest image.  Remember, the examiner can not tell what you see only what you tell him you see. </p><p>Astigmatism is generally caused by uneven curvature of he front surface of the cornea.  The amount of unevenness is extremely small for small amounts of astigmatism.  For-0.25 it would be a fraction of a mm.  Hard contacts can easily correct the unevenness and soft contacts can smooth the unevenness some and -0.25 doesn't take much smoothing to fix so it is easily possible that you see better with the contacts. </p><p>Mention the difference to the examiner at your next exam. </p><p>You are pretty close to the Rx where there is a difference between glasses and contact Rx.  That Rx is between -4 and -5 in your glasses.  It should not be necessary in the -2.75 to -3 range. </p><p>C.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>country girl</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2011, 18:34</p><p>hello just need some advice, I have a glasses prescription and a contact lens prescription for -3.00 and -2.75, the only diference is the glasses has a -0.25 astigmatism correction for the -2.75 lens, I had an eyetest about a year ago and couldnt read the 6-6 line out of my -2.75 -0.25 eye but could see the 6-6 line with the -3.00 eye, </p><p> </p><p>i shortly got contacts, without the astigmastism correction in it and i found that i could easily see the 6-6 line with the -2.75 eye </p><p> </p><p>is it posible that the astigmastim correction isnt right for my eye and causing me problems to see, i also mentioned this to the optician that i am able to see things with much more shaprness and clarity when i wear contact lenses and he said that people in my eyesight range tend to see better with contacts, what are other peoples experiences of this, can you see better with contacts and is it becasue of the reduced minification( i think thats what the optician called it) </p><p> </p><p>iv got a test coming up soon and its causing me a bit of worry that im not going to be abkle to read the 6-6 line, even though i know that my eyes are capable of it in contact lenses</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2011, 10:40</p><p>Jess </p><p>If it has been as long as you say it has been since your last eye exam, I think much has changed. Expect the exam to take about 35 - 45 minutes and now eye exams can even determine if you have diabetes or even heart trouble. And of course it cover all phases of your vision.  </p><p>Computers have become eye doctors best friend over the years. It is not surprising that working at a computer for long hours each day for the past year is having an effect on your vision. What you described is very normal, the burning of the eyes, feeling tired and noticing that car plates and other things after dark are increasing more difficult to make out. what happens to most is you become transfixed on the monitor and your eyes get set at looking at the same distance for long periods of time and you tend to not blink enough. Everyone that spends their day at a computer should make a point to take breaks and look away from the monitor and off into the distance so their eyes have a chance to refocus every so often. It is almost certain that you will be prescribed glasses for distance and since the computer is a factor I would suggest that you also wear them while on the computer as well. </p><p>Do let us know the results of your exam and be sure to ask for a copy of your prescription as well. </p><p>By the way will you be okay with wearing glasses or a little shy about it? It may help now if you mention to friends, family and co-workers that your going for an exam and you think you may get glasses. That makes wearing them much easier for the first time.</p><p></p><hr>

It has all started in the last couple of months, I think it might be due to my new job which i started about a year ago which involves being on the computer for the majority of the day. </p><p>I have noticed that my eyes started to ache and feel tired in the evenings after being at work.

<p><b>very progressive</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2011, 14:29</p><p>As I had mentioned on another thread, I have now been told that I have very early cataracts. My opthalmologist (an assoc of the Dr I used to see) told me she could see that my lenses were showing signs of crystallizing?  </p><p> </p><p>As I had recently gone to an optometrist to fit me with multi focal contacts (different practice), and had been told that I don't have cataracts, I am concerned. When realizing that I had come in without my glasses on. She did not know that I had received contacts from another Dr., she was concerned that I wasn't wearing my glasses as much as I need to. I told her that I had been wearing contacts, and removed them for the exam.(medical problem, not a refraction). She questioned me as to when I wore my glasses. I told her most of the time. She seemed bothered by that , (although my rx is not at all strong), and informed me that I should consider wearing my glasses more. I asked her vaguely about the progression of presbyopia and at what age it would stabilize. I beleive she may have meant the cataracts, and said that vision increasingly gets worse, and never better. She is concerned about my not wearing my glasses as she states I will develop asthenopia (eye strain). Is her concern about my not wearing glasses (have a mild rx) because of the cataracts?, am I likely to need increasingly stronger glasses?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2011, 22:29</p><p>Since getting the 3D Base In Prism Prescription in each eye back in February I have noticed I am a little more walleyed especially with glasses on, which I wear all the time anyways.  I assume this is normal.. My left eye tends to sit a little farther out then my right eye.  I'm not crazy about the way it looks because I look a little cross-eyed/wall eyed now and never remember my eyes sitting like that before even when I had a 2D base in prism prescription in each eye. But the prescription is very comfortable.. I have tried my older glasses on with no prism just to see what it feel like and I feel a big pulling effect in my left eye and everything is double when I try to read.  With noticing how my eyes sit now, I am worried I will need another prism increase at my next exam.. I'm just not too crazy about the wall eyed look and my left eye sitting so far out.. Anyone have any thoughts?    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2011, 08:01</p><p>Buck, </p><p>The probable reason you have had no response is that you didn't supply enough information to provide an explanation. </p><p>I can't speak for others, but I do not maintain records of every Rx I am asked about and I do not have time or inclination to go back and manually search all the posts on all the threads to see if I can find where you posted it last.  Please include your COMPLETE (all elements) Rx and If we are being asked to explain differences between two Rx, we need both Rx and the elapsed time between them. </p><p>One of the most common reasons for  small differences in Cylinder Axis is measurement error caused by lack of exam experience on the part of the patient.  I have explained the reason for this many times.  Accurate determination of the Axis is very subjective and requires the patient to judge relative blurriness of two images as the examiner flips a supplemental lens 45 degrees each side of the trial axis.  It is not easy and a few degrees don't make a lot of difference in blurriness at low cylinder powers.   I suspect the reversal you stated is simply a coincidence and within the range of typical error is the cylinder is -0.50 or less. </p><p>Another common reason for a big difference (around 90 degrees) is one Rx is written as - cylinder and the other is + cylinder.  Either one is valid and if the lens maker is given a + cylinder Rx, he will convert it to - cylinder and make the lens. </p><p>I can't explain the differences in vertical prism except to say that prism determinations can be highly variable except in rare instances where the eye positioning muscles or their control system cannot function at all. </p><p>If the glasses are not right, you need to have them re-made from a new exam.  Even small errors in vertical prism are difficult for you to compensate for.  Your muscle control system is not programmed to allow individual control of vertical motion of your eyes. </p><p>Theoretically, with proper calibration of the optical powers of the exam equipment, the eye chart can be at almost any known distance.  However, my experience has been that the most accurate exams are where the distance eye chart is actually 20 ft or 6 meters away.  Many exam rooms have mirrors to keep their size small, but they are compromises and not as good as the real thing, partially because the mirror coating is on the back side of the glass (for protection) optically accurate mirrors are front surface, but they are subject to becoming tarnished. </p><p>The distance from you to the chart is VERY important, you need to not allow yourself to be distracted from YOUR chart of you introduce variables that can affect the exam results.  By concentrating on the wrong chart, the exam is invalid and the resulting glasses are likely to be not right.  Actually, the fault may be yours and not the examiners.  A good eye exam is the result of good teamwork between you and the examiner.  The examiner has no way to see what you are seeing and you have to give him accurate answers to his questions. </p><p>C. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 May 2011, 11:45</p><p>russell, </p><p>You are right.  Auto refractors print out the sphere, cylinder and axis that they measure and the examiner can use that as an initial setting of the phropter which is essentially what they do as a result of the initial (objective) part of an eye exam.  All a machine or a human examiner can really tell by looking into your eyes is how an image appears to focus on your retina, not what you are seeing. </p><p>In some countries, particularly where myopia is extremely common, glasses are sold based on the results of a auto refractor.  I suspect that it does not take very many exams to get a pretty good idea of how far off the auto refractor is from a prescription the customer will be satisfied with and adjust it accordingly.  From a sales point of view, in a predominantly myopic market, a little bit of over correction in sphere would be the smart thing to do because it can be compensated for by a little accommodation. </p><p>Some members probably have experience buying glasses prescribed by an auto refractor.  Perhaps they can tell us about the experience. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>russell</b>&nbsp;30 May 2011, 09:10</p><p>Never having seen a printout for the autorefractor, I assumed it was a prescription determined by a machine, thus leaving the examiner not much to do when prescribing.  I preferred the old days when the doctor did it all him (or her) self.  Am I wrong in assuming that in some countries, glasses are sold based on an autorefractor exam only?  I seem to remember seeing optical shops in other countries that have an autorefractor on the counter, waiting to be used by the customer.  Correct me if I'm wrong on any of this.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;29 May 2011, 20:30</p><p>russell, </p><p>I doubt seriously if you could "beat" an auto refractor, nor is it worthwhile trying. </p><p>First of all, they are not extremely accurate anyway and they are rather quick.  By the time you figure out what you want to do, they have made the measurement.  They really have only one function ant that is to perform the objective part of the exam where the examiner looks in your eyes with an opthalmoscope to get an Idea of your approximate Rx. </p><p>You are much better off getting the most accurate Rx you can and then ordering the Rx you want online as long as you understand what you are doing. </p><p>Andrew, </p><p>Eye exams have been done without auto refractors for years.  Many examiners still prefer to do the objective part of the exam manually.  Your final Rx is determined in the subjective part of the exam where you tell the examiner what you see.   </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2011, 18:56</p><p>So I got my new glasses with the 3D Base in Prism for each eye... They will take some getting used too..  This is the 1st time i've used them on the computer.  They seem a little more comfortable.. But still feel more pressure on my nose and my eyes seem to be taking a little while to get used to them.  The inside edges seem a lot thicker to me than my last ones which were 2D Base In each eye.  Here is the link to what they look like... The pictures aren't the best.. But they will at least give you an idea of the thickness of the lenses.. Zoom in for a little better look..  </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://community.webshots.com/album/579809274vZmcxf" target="_blank">http://community.webshots.com/album/579809274vZmcxf</a>  </p><p> </p><p>I really hope they don't get much stronger.  Because 3D Base in is strong enough looking.. At least they are on the inside edge instead of the outside edge because the inside edge isn't as noticeable.  I have a feeling though I'm going to continue to need more prism because my eye doctor has said several times, she could give me a lot more prism but didn't want to give me too much too soon.. My glasses won't look too pretty if I get over 5 to 6 D of prism in each eye. I even have high index lenses in my glasses, but i don't think that affects the prism correction at all. I have also noticed since I 1st got the prism in my glasses last year if I take a photo without my glasses, my eye wanders out.  So I really try to keep my glasses on for pictures. I'm sure if I wear these for a few days I'll get used to them.  I'll let you know how it goes.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2011, 14:45</p><p>Kylie </p><p>In my opinion there is not much you can do to reverse what is happening. That is your actual rx may drop back some more. But as you asked the other day about what prescriptions can be worn full time? Well -1.50 and -2.00 is still in the area where full time is a good idea. But remember very few people know much about rxs and I have friends that only wear -.50 and they wear them full time for fashion mostly. The only thing that you can do is what your doing, continue wearing the strongest glasses that your eyes can tolerate and never mind what your actual rx is. If your -3.50's are too strong back down to maybe -3.00 or even -2.75 whatever works for you. Wearing stronger than need glasses can't hurt in trying to keep your true rx up some.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kylie</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2011, 14:25</p><p>Thanks Tom, Soundmanpt and Aubrac </p><p>My current prescription is only -1.50 and -2 and it seems to be getting less each time I go. I used to have -2.5 and -2.75 and I wore my glasses alot of the time, I got lots of compliments and really felt that they made me look more serious. I'm really disappointed that my prescription is going down and i'd really like to stop it. I feel glasses add to my look but I don't want to wear what might look like quite a low prescription full time. If I could coax my prescription back up again it would be a brilliant result.

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2011, 02:35</p><p>Kylie </p><p> </p><p>That depends on the optician and how keen he is to sell glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I took my 17 yo daughter for a check up several years ago and he prescribed +0.25 in one eye, plano the other, needless to say we did not bother getting it filled.

Simple answer is it can be different for each person and what type of rx you have. In other words there is no set answer.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2011, 07:06</p><p>Astra, </p><p>There should not be any difference in 1,3, &amp; 4 of those factors mentioned, provided the frames a appropriately sized so the optical center of the lenses is close to the central axis of vision.  There would be a small increase in convergence to read at the same distance of the wider spacing and geometry involved.  The wider spacing should theoretically improve depth perception and 3-D perception because of the wider spacing of the two "cameras". </p><p>If you have ever seen a 3-D cinema or TV production where they make something many meters or feet away (distance to the screen) appear to be in your face, that is done by increasing the spacing between the two cameras.  However, remember that vision actually occurs in the brain and everyone's brain learns to deal with the images as presented in constructing your perception of the world.  A person's PD changes from birth to adulthood verrrry slowly so the brain has a lot of time to work out the differences.  A good example of how the brain can compensate for image differences, consider the minification effects of changing from from contacts to glasses when a person need a high minus correction and how quickly the brain compensates.  It is almost as if the brain stores two image processing algorythms and loads the appropriate one for the situation.  GOCers, really experience the effect when they first start wearing a high minus combination, but it is amazing how quickly the brain compensates for the image size on the retina and everything just starts to look "normal". </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2011, 20:40</p><p>Brian, </p><p>BI prism is much less noticeable than BO prism.  For the most part if people notice anything is is the thickness of the outer edges of the lenses.  With BI prism, the outer edges get thinner and the inside edges get thicker. </p><p>I don't think this is the time to get too worried about appearance.  Your vision is the primary consideration. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

I've tried my old glasses with no prism correction, and I feel my left eye drifting out some and if I try to use the computer or read, I have a headache within 5 minutes.. With my current prescription with the prism, I still notice at times when my eyes are tired or relaxed I still get a little double vision and have to refocus things when reading or using the computer.. Most of the time its not bad.. Kinda of reminds me of the way things were before I got a prism correction originally.  I do notice more fatigue now than when I first got the prism correction which makes me think I might see an increase.  Hopefully it will stabalize soon because I've seen some of the thicker prism prescriptions and they don't look pretty.  2D is probably not noticable to anyone unless I tell them I have a prism correction in my glasses but im sure if it increases anymore it will start to get more noticeable. Thanks for the response.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2011, 19:15</p><p>Brian, </p><p>Are you noticing any double vision when your eyes are very relaxed or when you read?  2D of prism is not very much but it is it is useful to see how well you tolerate BI prism and if the prism increases your comfort.  I suspect you will be prescribed a bit more prism if the current prism has helped. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2011, 11:44</p><p>I'm going to get my annual eye exam next week.  It will be my first exam since getting a prism correction in my glasses last year so I'm interested to see if my prism will stay the same or increase or maybe decrease(I doubt that will be the case). I have a feeling it will increase because I was told the 2D Base In prescription I received in each eye last year was likely a starting point.  My distance prescription was relatively stable last year staying at -6.00 and -5.25 so I don't expect much of a change there.  For those of you that wear prism did you notice much of a change after you went for your 1st exam after getting a prism correction?  I'll let you know next week how things turn out.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;01 Feb 2011, 10:39</p><p>Tom, </p><p>I think you have enough information to order some glasses from an online retailer if you want to.  If you feel uncomfortable doing that, I think if you could find an Eye Care Professional to prescribe some glasses for driving with a low minus sphere correction. </p><p>You need to be aware that it will not be long before presbyopia rears its head, but even when it does, you may find that bifocals are not the full answer for both work and general wear. </p><p>If asked, I would suggest that you try some low cost glasses from Zenni Optical with the following Rx. </p><p>OD Sphere -0.50, Cylinder -0.75 x 90 </p><p>OS Sphere -0.50, Cylinder -0.75 x 90 </p><p>The only other thing you need to place an order is your Pupilary Distance (PD).  If you don't have it, you can measure it very easily with a rule marked in mm and a bathroom mirror.  I think Zenni has instructions on their web site, but I will tell you how, if you can't find it. </p><p>Because this is an experiment, I would suggest ordering a low cost frame similar to your prescribed glasses, if possible, and perhaps the anti-reflective coating for night driving.  Even with International Shipping, the total cost will probably be less than US$25.00. </p><p>I hope this helps.  If you have other questions, please ask. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;01 Feb 2011, 08:38</p><p>Cactus Jack, thanks for your advice. </p><p> </p><p>I am 36 yrs old, working in finance (computer work and/or reading papers almost all day), living in the NL. </p><p> </p><p>I presume that, whatever SPH correction I want, I should not change the cylinder and axis? I might ask my optician to provide me with a low minus SPH together with my correct cylinder? </p><p> </p><p>Cheers!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2011, 18:19</p><p>Tom, </p><p>Based on your Rx, you are very slightly hyperopic (long or far sighted), but the dominant element in your Rx is the astigmatism as indicated by the -0.75 cylinder.  Astigmatism affects sharpness at all distances and would be most noticeable when reading small text at any distance. </p><p>If you went for another exam, unfortunately, you probably would not get the Rx you prefer.  If you combine your GF's glasses and yours you wound up (approximately) with: </p><p>Sphere -2.75 Cylinder -0.75, Axis 90 in both eyes.  The sphere over correction was accommodated by your internal crystaline lenses and the result was extremely sharp vision, particularly at night.  The way your crystaline lenses compensated for the extra minus was by responding as if you were reading at about 13 inches or 33 cm even though you were looking at more distant objects.  Depending on your accommodation range, you may or may not have experienced some discomfort trying to read with them, but the images would have probably been sharp. </p><p>By the way, intentionally wearing excess minus correction is what people do who would like to be more myopic or near or short sighted.   They like the sharpness and slight minification offered by the over correction.  Check out the Induced Myopia thread. </p><p>Depending on a few factors, you can order almost any Rx you want at very low cost, on line, without a formal prescription.  We can teach you how. </p><p>Could I ask a few more questions? </p><p>1. Your Age? </p><p>2. Your Occupation? If attending University, your field of study? </p><p>3. Where you live? </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2011, 16:53</p><p>Two months ago when driving at night I told my girlfriend I experienced ble some trouble to discern the road from the pastures bedsdes it. She was in her glasses that night and jokingly passed them to me. I had never tried them on before (she's usually in contacts) but I did when stopping at a traffic light, and to my surprise things seemed sharper though "spinning" a bit. I went for an eye test the next weekend and was prescribed SPH +0.25 CYL -.075 90Â° for both eyes. I handed them back to her as I didn't feel that comfortable to drive in them, and she said she felt naked without. </p><p> </p><p>However, when I got my glasses, I didn't experience much improvement when driving, but I did for closer work (computer, newspaper reading). This puzzled me as I remembered how my girlfriend's glasses did improve distance vision, which I told her. She got her glasses out of her bag for me and we did some "testing". The best result for distance vision was for me when looking to both her and mine glasses together. Close vision best with my glasses only. Hers are SPH -3.00 both eyes, no cylinder.  </p><p> </p><p>Should I go back to the optometrist? to another one? tell them what I found out beforehand or not?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2011, 15:38</p><p>Soundmanpt - my friend is similar to me, (she's -2.50 and -3 nowadays) so I knew she'd got it back to front! This was a new prescription last year and her old contacts were -2.75 so I guess the glasses prescription she had at the time was less. </p><p> </p><p>And you have very good recall, my cyl is -0.50. I assume it'll stay the same, although a friend of mine had -0.75 of cyl that completely disappeared but here spherical prescription went up. So I suppose nothing is necessarily a constant.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2011, 14:02</p><p>Clare your friend had it backwords anyway. With a higher rx than -3.00 or -4.00, usually the glasses need to be slightly stronger than the contacts. This is because the contacts sits on the eye and glasses are about 1/2" away from the eye.  </p><p>The only difference for you is your glasses have your astigmatism correction in them and your contacts don't as I recall. If I recall your cyl is only -.50. not enogh to bother with for the contacts. However at -.75 you may need to get toric lenses, sadly they are quite a bit more expensive.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2011, 13:33</p><p>And - my contacts and glasses prescriptions have always been the same (which I understand is usual under -4). But a friend of mine was under the impression that glasses should be less than contacts prescriptions and was annoyed because her optician had given her the same for both. </p><p> </p><p>Like Lenses - actually, not that long, probably 10+ years so I think I have a while to go before I have any corneal issues.And if it did happen? Well I guess I'd get on with it, I'd probably still take them off and on alot but that can be quite theatrical!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Obsessed</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2011, 18:07</p><p>I think that the cut-in becomes very apparent once you reach -1.5 D in your RX.

The lens is thinner, but the cut-in and the visual minimization of your eyes behind the lenses are not really affected by the index. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2011, 13:43</p><p>I know this question has been asked a thousand times before, but could one of the experts weigh in on the minimum prescription at which cut-in becomes visible? </p><p> </p><p>Also, am I correct that the index of the lens material cannot alter cut-in, but only minimise edge thickness?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>contact lens issues</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2010, 16:32</p><p>hi clare,  </p><p> </p><p>did you find that your vision was ok in the air optix lenses? I have heard that they are quite good,  </p><p> </p><p>what is your prescription if you dont mind me asking? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2010, 13:45</p><p>contact lens issues - I wear contacts and have found a noticeable difference between brands, to the extent that they directly affect my near/far vision. I regularly wear Air Optix but fancied some disposables. I'd previously had to give up disposables as my eyes became sensitive to them. I tried Day Soft which were really comfortable, unlike my old Focus Dailies, but the vision I got from exactly the same prescription as my regular silicone hydrogel (Air Optix) wasn't comparable.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2010, 16:53</p><p>contact lens issues, </p><p>Probably not, but you can order some on line without an Rx if you want to.  Are the lenses a recognized brand or are they private label? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2010, 15:48</p><p>contact lens issues, </p><p>The difference could have been part of it, but I suspect the biggest part of the problem was the CLs. </p><p>Actually, with the -2.50s you are slightly under corrected for distance and you are getting little help in focusing on the music.  The important thing is the comfort and utility for performance purposes. </p><p>The slight under correction with the contacts might cause your distance vision to be marginal for driving purposes, but perfectly acceptable for everything else.  If you need to drive, just take out the contacts and wear your glasses. </p><p>If you find that you prefer wearing contacts and you need a little better distance vision, you can try -2.75 or -3.00 in both eyes.  Just stay with the same brand, BC and Diameter as the comfortable -2.50s. </p><p>I'm glad you have found a solution.  Please visit as often as you can.  The more you learn about your vision and optics, the better you can manage it. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;18 Dec 2010, 14:37</p><p>contact lens issues, </p><p>That seems a little close to me, but of course it depends on your instrument. </p><p>I am more familiar with Pianos and Organs.  On a large Organ with 3 or 4 manuals (keyboards), the music can be more than arms length away in the 30 to 40 inch range. </p><p>You should not be experiencing any issues with CLs that fit well if you are not having any problems with your glasses.  If you were a little less myopic, you might be able to read the music quite well without glasses or contacts.  In the -3.00 range, your focus distance is around 13 inches. </p><p>In winter with low humidities, eye dryness can be a big problem with contacts.  If you have problems with low tear production, there are some new Rx (in the US) eye drops, called Restasis, that help some people increase tear production. </p><p>I urge you to get to the core of the problem.  You might need to see an independent Eye Care Professional.  Ideally one that specialized in CLs.  </p><p>May I ask your instrument?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2010, 15:36</p><p>contact lens issues, </p><p>Sorry about my error, that changes things a bit.  Because the -0.25 cylinder is in the Right Eye and the sphere is -2.75, the compromise Rx for that contact lens would be -2.875 which is not available.  Either -2.75 or -3.00 should be satisfactory, but I would choose -3.00 because you can easily accommodate the small over correction.  The -3.00 contact should be correct for your Left Eye. </p><p>The reason for the difference between a glasses Rx and a CL Rx, other than cylinder compromises, is vertex distance, but its effects on Rx below -5.00 are so small that they are ignored. </p><p>I am wondering if there is not something else going on perhaps related to the base curve and perhaps tear production.  Winter, with its low humidities are very hard on CL wearers with low tear production. </p><p>At your age, there should be an extremely low probability of presbyopia, but it is not out of the question.  The fact that you have no problems reading with glasses confirms that it is very unlikely in your case. </p><p>I am mildly suspicious that there is some issue with the contacts themselves and I might be worthwhile to go back to the prescribing optician and express your complaints.  Not all brands of contacts are alike, even though they have the same Rx, BC and Diameter.  It is not unusual to have to try several brands to find the ones that you like best.  </p><p>The same applies to CL solutions.  The unfortunate thing about hydrogen peroxide solution is that it may not have any lubricant.  Have you found any Artificial Tears with lubricant that you can tolerate?  Another possibility are one day wear contacts.  They are typically stored in sterile saline solution and no disinfection is required because you throw them away after each day of wear. </p><p>One thing you might try is slightly lower power CLs for use with sheet music.  If you will measure the typical distance from your eyes to the sheet music.  If you will measure the distance and let us know, we can suggest a CL power you can try. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2010, 20:30</p><p>contact lens issues, </p><p>I need a little more information about your glasses Rx before can be of help on your CL Rx.  If possible I need your complete glasses Rx.  I am concerned about the following: </p><p>1.  It appears that you have no astigmatism or cylinder correction in your Right Eye.  If that is so, the CL Rx for that eye is theoretically correct. </p><p>2. You indicated that you have some astigmatism in your Left Eye requiring 0.25 cylinder, however you did not indicate if it was + cylinder or - cylinder.  For now, the axis is not particularly important. </p><p>Ideally, a person with astigmatism should wear toric contacts to accurately correct it.  However, toric contacts are expensive, hard to fit, and often do not give good correction for low values of cylinder because they often rotate on the cornea as you blink.  Unless the toric CL is at the correct axis angle, they make the astigmatism worse rather than better.  Glasses don't have this problem because the axis of the cylinder is fixed. </p><p>A compromise solution is to use a sphere only contact with 1/2 the cylinder added to the sphere correction. </p><p>If the cylinder correction in your Left Eye is +0.25 then a sphere of -2.50 would be a possible compromise.  If the cylinder correction in your Left Eye is -0.25 then the sphere only CL Rx for that eye should be -3.00.  Remember, adjusting the sphere to partially accommodate the cylinder is a compromise because the astigmatism is not corrected properly.  Unfortunately, uncorrected astigmatism causes fine text and lines to not be clear at all distances and if you are left eye dominant you would likely notice it reading music. </p><p>Fitting contact lenses is an art and some brands of CLs work better for some people than others.  May I ask the brand you are using? </p><p>Also, humidity and the lubricating quality or your tear film can make a difference.  May I ask where you live and what brand of CL solution you are using? </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

I have an interesting problem that has got me beat and hope someone can 'explain'. </p><p> </p><p>I wear -6.0 contacts pretty much most of the time. I also wear +2.00 readers over the contact at work on the computer. I've been doing this for a few years (i'm 38) as they help with reading. I usually will wear them most of the time in the office as distance vision does not matter all that much there as everything is close. </p><p> </p><p>Last week I didn't bother to take them off when I went for a walk to get lunch as I wanted to read my favourite magazine. I noticed that didtance was rather clear! How can that be? I took them off only to discover that there was a slight blurr. So i left them on. I tried leaving them on for the rest of the day even on the way home. I was trying the on-off-on-off thing and i felt that they assisted for distance as well. The next day I also left them on intentinally during the day and i noticed that I could read distant book covers...before no chance. I left them on for a few days (even though my wife was saying not to) and started feeling that i needed them. </p><p> </p><p>Now here is the issue...lurking around here for years made me become learned so I dug up an older pair of contacts that were -4.25 fresh out of a box (even though the expiery date was off) thinking that my age may mean that I need lesser Rx. I put them on and everything was blurry. I felt i needed that extra minus. I even tried my older glasses and same thing. </p><p> </p><p>SO how can wearing +2 over -6 contacts give me clear vision while a -4 contact does not?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2010, 22:04</p><p>Dave, </p><p> </p><p>You can do a lot better than the trial lens set you showed on eBay. Pay a little more  and you will get much more (I bought a very complete, almost new set with trial frame for about $150). You can always resell it on eBay when you are through.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Angela</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2010, 21:53</p><p>Edmund,  It took a day or so to fully adjust to them.  I could actually feel my eyes relaxing more with them on now. At first it felt like my eyes were repositioning themselves if that makes any sense. Not a bad feeling just different.  But they really help. Computer work and reading is so much easier now.  How long have you worn prism glasses?  Do you have any pictures of your glasses?  Hopefully mine don't end up being that strong. I do notice a lot of double vision now when I take them off.  Not that I can even see much at all to begin with, when I am not wearing my glasses anyways.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Edmund</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2010, 21:18</p><p>Hi Angela </p><p> </p><p>I also have prism correction, 8 Base in per eye.  How was it to adjust to those glasses?  My RX is -3.25 cyl -1.25 add +2.25 8 base in each eye</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Angela</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2010, 18:17</p><p>I'm 31 years old and just got a prism correction for the 1st time as well.  Unlike some others that posted earlier, I've always worn glasses, got my 1st pair when I was 8 years old. Tried contacts when I was 16, but dry eyes prevented me from ever wearing them with success. I was having trouble focusing when reading and thought I might need bifocals.  The doc said its an eye muscle problem and have been reading with no problems since I got the new glasses with prisms.  I'm 3D Base In for each eye.  -6.25 -5.50.  I uploaded some pictures of my glasses.  Sorry they are not in great focus.  I'll try to get some others up that are in better focus.   <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57062976@N06/5261647875/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/57062976@N06/5261647875/</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Jul 2010, 15:51</p><p>Heather </p><p>Very glad to hear that it took care of the problem. I know you were concerned about not have clear vision from your right eye. Did they charge you for a new lens? I ask because how long was it since you were given the -4.25 / -5.00 rx? If it was only a couple of months they must have under prescribed you and should not have charged you. But the good news is that now with the stronger lens your vision is crystal clear. You should soon start to stablize I would think. I'm sure you hope so. Remember even though your glasses are a bit stronger again, the main thing is that you can see 20/20 with them. Once someone decides on full time wear via glasses or contacts the only real difference is what you can't see without them.  </p><p>Glad you like your new glasses, i'm sure they look very nice and thin too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;16 Jul 2010, 15:31</p><p>As you may remember, I had noticed that my vision wasn't perfect in my right eye (my better eye) although I only had an eye exam a few months ago where I got a prescription of -4.25 (right) and -5.00 (left). I ended up going back to the optician to get to get my rechecked today and sure enough I got an increase in my right eye but luckily not my left eye. I am now -5.00 in both eyes. I got my right lens replaced immediately with a -5.00 lens and everything seems cristal clear now. Thickness is not really an issue as I got very thin lenses (1.74) and I have been used to the thickness from my left eye already. I am just glad my weaker left eye did not deteriorate.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2010, 18:41</p><p>Dave, </p><p>Be sure it includes a trial frame.  You can learn a lot about optics and vision with just a few lenses,  It is unfortunate that it does not have two of each. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2010, 16:44</p><p>CJ, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for that. </p><p> </p><p>Yes it has enough lenses to make either eye but not both at the same time.  From this set I couldn't see how to get -1.75 and -2.25 cylinder at the same time. </p><p> </p><p>The lenses are: </p><p> </p><p>Concave Cylinder Lens: -0.25, -050,  -1.00, -2.00 </p><p>Convex Cylinder Lens: +0.25, +050, +1.00,  +2.00 </p><p>Concave Spherical Lens: -0.25, -050, -075, -1.00,  -2.00, -3.00, -4.00, -5.00 </p><p>Convex Spherical Lens: +0.25,  +050, +075, +1.00,  +2.00, +3.00, +4.00, +5.00 </p><p> </p><p>It is surely a low budget and less-than-adequate set for anyone in the business.  I'm just interested in playing around and seeing if I can fine tune my Rx beyond what the optometrist says. </p><p> </p><p>Dave</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2010, 15:05</p><p>Dave, </p><p>You could, but most trial lens sets have two of everything unless some are purposefully missing.  Theoretically, if you do the conversion from - to + cylinder properly, it should make no difference.  In reality, lens makers, if given an Rx with + cylinder, do the conversion and make the glasses from the resulting - cylinder Rx.  If the set does not have two of each lens, you can do as you described.  If you do decide to have glasses made, be sure and convert the + cylinder back to - cylinder so that the Rx is in the same format for both eyes. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2010, 13:50</p><p>Cactus or anyone else who knows. </p><p> </p><p>Question about trial lens sets.  I was looking at a cheap set on Ebay to play around with.  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2dlluhq" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/2dlluhq</a> </p><p> </p><p>There aren't enough lenses to make my prescription.  Is it possible to use - cylinder notation on one side and + cylinder on the other side? </p><p> </p><p>for instance: </p><p> </p><p>OD -0.50 -2.25 x 165 </p><p>OS -0.50 -1.75 x 015  converted to -2.25 + 0.50 x 105 </p><p> </p><p>would the converted Rx give the same effect in a trial lens set? </p><p> </p><p>Thanks, </p><p> </p><p>Dave</p><p></p><hr>

One senior manager declared they suited me, and was talking  with another colleague about being previously worried they were a bit bold. He said not at all, they are nice. Still getting used to myself in them though- seems a little strange when I pass a mirror.

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;10 Jul 2010, 07:47</p><p>Aubrac - welcome to the capital city, and what a hot week it's been! Which part of the country do you live in? Interesting that you make the observation that there are lots of glasses wearers in town - if you add the number of contacts wearers (like my friends, Hollie, me ...) there must be a lot of people who could be wearing glasses. Plus, of course, those who should but aren't and it's a lot!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;10 Jul 2010, 00:27</p><p>daffy/soundmanpt </p><p> </p><p>I've been spending more time in London recently and was amazed at how many people are now wearing glasses. It could be that vision is getting generally worse with increasing use of close focus screens and would be interested to see the stats on this. </p><p> </p><p>However, I think it is as Soundmanpt said, more to do with needing better vision for hand held devices, smaller text size, lower levels of lighting, etc. Also the fact that is more 'cool' now to wear glasses. In my local town far more teenage girls are wearing low plus glasses FT and seem to like showing off their glasses look. </p><p> </p><p>Regarding prisms, I got my wife glasses with 3 degrees base out nearly a year ago. Since then she seems more comfortable wearing them and is nearly FT now. I got her spare also made up with prisms and tried wearing them for a few hours. The cylinder correction made me feel a little groggy and as though my legs were sinking into the ground, and after taking them off my eyes tried to cross for quite a time. I can only think that after FT wear for a few weeks, the eye muscles would get used to the adjustmnet, and it would be hard to do without them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daffy</b>&nbsp;09 Jul 2010, 04:32</p><p>Brian...yes i did 'experiment' with prism...i didn't actually want to have cross-eyes so i went with 3 Base In in both eyes. I was naturally -6.00 with some -0.75cyl. It took about a week or two initially to adjust without feeling dizzy as i felt it pulled my eyes out. I then liked the feeling. That feeling went away so i did 6 Base In.  </p><p>It wasn't too long that I got used to them...but the thing was that after about 3 or 4 days, i noticed that the reverse happened...I really needed to wear Base In to feel like i can see comfortably. So I was wearing the 3Base in mostly then only on odd occasions wore the 6base in. </p><p>I then changed my mind and wanted to not wear them any more. BUt i couldn't do without. I went to the eyedoc and explained what i did. He done his usual tests and i was really prescribed the 3 base in. </p><p>I actually regret doing it because i became dependant on them. I can;t wear contact either. I've been posting here a couple times detering people from experimenting with prisms.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2010, 08:05</p><p>Daffy,  That is interesting about your sister-in-law.  I know awhile back you talked about getting prisms in your glasses.  What is your current prescription and prism correction?  I got prisms in my glasses for the 1st time this past March that are 2BI in each eye.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2010, 07:12</p><p>daffy </p><p>I am beginning to think there is no normal anymore for vision needs. I have come across 2 people in the last month both in there early 30's that were just prescribed their first glasses and both have minus lenses mainly needed for driving. At the same time in the last 2 years I have more young people needing reading glasses than in the past. I think it has something to do with so many small hand held devices in use these days.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daffy</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2010, 07:00</p><p>just a question...is it normal for a 36 year old to suddenly need glasses for myopia? My sister in law suprized me today when she turned up at an event with me wearing glasses. I asked her the Rx and it was -1 with -0.5cyl on left and -0.5 -0.5cyl on the right. She used to brag that she was the only one in ther family that didn't need glasses. She went every year for a check up. I would have expected plus glasses at this age not -1!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2010, 22:35</p><p>Heather </p><p>If it bothers you enough then you may want to go back sooner. Holding out will not do any damage to your eye.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2010, 21:52</p><p>You're cool, Heather...............:) Pete</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2010, 20:50</p><p>One more thing: As some of you may remember I got a new prescription of -4.25 (right) and -5.00(left) about two months ago. While I can generally see well with these glasses, I noticed that my vision in the right eye (the -4.25 eye) does not seem to be perfect. If I squint, that makes the vision slightly better. Also, if I look through my left -5 lens with my right eye, my vision is really crisp and clear. So I guess I will probably get a slight increase on the right side in my next eye exam ... frustrating! I am now wondering whether I should wait until my next eye test is due or go back to the optician sooner than that. Not that I am keen to get an increase, quite the opposite, but I am concerned that the eye could further weaken if I don't put the proper lens in front of it. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2010, 20:08</p><p>Soundmanpt - Tennis is okay with the new glasses. Not great but much better than with my old glasses. The thing is that when I had a weak Rx I was able to wear contact lenses so I never had to wear glasses for tennis. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus jack</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2010, 10:52</p><p>Questioner, </p><p>If non-straight, non-plumb lines bother you and your background and training demand perfection, very high Rx glasses have lots of distortion problems, will probably drive you nuts, and the fundamental problem will still exist.  High minus glasses are famous for "barrel" edge distortion and chromatic distortion and high plus glasses have that plus extremely narrow fields of view, similar to binoculars.  After a while your brain can compensate for the glasses distortion, but the corners will still not be square. </p><p>I strongly suspect that as you said, your older home has settled and it probably does have a lot of non plumb and non square corners.  I think you really have only a couple of choices: </p><p>1. Learn the Prayer of Serenity and repeat it frequently: </p><p>       "God, grant me the serenity </p><p>       To accept the things I cannot change; </p><p>       Courage to change the things I can; </p><p>       And wisdom to know the difference" </p><p>2. Sell the house and build one you like - maybe somewhere warmer in winter - on a slab foundation where there is extremely stable soil.  I live in Houston and even slabs have problems here. </p><p>3. Speaking as a bit of a perfectionist myself, I don't think a "shrink" is the answer unless your wallet is in extremely good shape.  The money would be better spent fixing the problems if the fix is worth it.  There is not much wrong with perfection, as long as you know when good enough is good enough and tilting at windmills is a waste of time. </p><p>4. I can give you some free advise that a doctor friend gave me one time.  When I complained that every time I did some particular thing it caused pain.  His response was the surgical fix is hardly worth the risk and money.  His suggestion was to not do the thing that caused the pain.  It worked. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Questioner</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2010, 08:04</p><p>In answer to your questions: I live in New England (USA). I am a retired mechanical engineer who does a lot of carpentry on my own house.  </p><p> </p><p>My ability to discern deviations from straight is a blessing when it comes to building things to a high standard, but a curse when dealing with an older building where nothing is straight, plumb or level. I get too caught up with getting it "right". If I didn't immediately see when a line is "off" maybe I could gloss over it - and finish my building projects.  </p><p> </p><p>One could reasonably argue that what I need is a psychologist not special glasses... </p><p> </p><p>My question arose when I put on my wife's glasses and noticed that horizontal lines appear to be curved when not looking straight at them  or when moving my head (of course, everything was blurred as her glasses are much stronger than mine).  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I understand that vision is a partnership of brain and optics, with the brain taking a controlling role, so I would expect that my brain would adapt to any optically induced distortion. But would that adaptation take over instantaneously whenever I put on the glasses? Or could I enjoy a few hours of distortion each time? </p><p> </p><p>I suppose one way to answer that question would be to find out how the perception of straight changes for someone very nearsighted who alternates between glasses and contacts (which I assume have not distortion). </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2010, 19:52</p><p>Questioner, </p><p>I believe that you need to approach the problem analytically.  You have presented a very complex issue potentially involving astigmatism, optics, eye muscle imbalance, balance sensors and even the visual cortex in the brain. Glasses and or contact lenses may not be the answer to your situation, though it is possible that you may need some prism correction in your glasses or even some eye muscle surgery. </p><p>The brain is easily fooled by intentional or unintentional optical illusions.  Vision actually occurs in the brain.  The eyes are merely biological cameras and the eye - brain combination is extremely sensitive to small details. </p><p>You have enough astigmatism that without your glasses, you brain is presented with slightly distorted images.  Normally, when presented with slightly blurry or distorted images, the brain will soon learn to correct the images so that true perspective exists.  You brain should have been able to adjust to any distortion with or without your glasses by now.  However, there are some optical illusions that are so clever that it does not matter how long you look at them, they still fool you. </p><p>It is possible that you have some eye muscle problems.  Each eye has 6 muscles that control the position of the eyes. There are two pairs of muscles for left-right and up-down, but also there is a pair of muscles called oblique that can move the eyes at an angle.  Certain combinations of muscle action can also cause the eyes to rotate slightly which can present unusual images to the brain.   </p><p>You should also consider that the semi-circular canals in your ears, which are your head position sensors, also play a role in what you see because their input is also available to the visual cortex and the eye positioning control system. </p><p>Have you had any dizziness or balance problems? </p><p>I can give you a few personal examples.  When got my first glasses at 14, I trouble for a day with ceiling corners of rooms not looking square.  After that everything has looked normal even with many Rx changes, cataract surgery, and wearing prism glasses.  Years later, when flat panel monitors were introduced, my reaction and that of several others were that the monitors were concave, not flat.  And then we realized that we had been looking at spherical faced monitors for years and out brains had made them look flat.  When presented with a flat image on the monitor, our brains tried to correct it, they looked concave for a few hours and then started looking flat.  Curiously, spherical faced monitors still looked flat so the brain recognized the difference and was able to compensate instantly even with flat and spherical monitors side by side. </p><p>I would suggest that the first step is to verify that your house is in fact not square, level and plumb.  This should be easy to do with a laser level, plumb bob, and carpenters square.  To check floor level over several rooms use a water level with a long water tube.  That is the tool that foundation repair people use to check for foundation problems. </p><p>It is possible that for some reason your brain is unable to compensate or adjust quickly for distorted images.  It could be a blessing or a curse depending on your visual needs.  May I ask your occupation, age, and where you live?  Also, do you have any problems with the appearance of the inside or outside of other structures? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

Maybe with the use of a sweat band as well, should help some.Were you able to find that anti-fog cleaner? The problem with needing glasses and playing tennis must have started with your first rx?

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;23 May 2010, 08:50</p><p>Brian-16, </p><p>The reason I asked you to contact me privately at cactusjack1928@hotmail.com is that your question requires a somewhat lengthy and complex answer that is hard to do here.  However, if you want me to answer here I will try to make the answer as concise and complete as possible. </p><p>The short answer to your question is:  With the information I remember about your Rx, astigmatism MAY be a small part of your acuity problem.   </p><p>I suspect that other, more dominant, factors such as high sphere, prism, eyeball elongation, retinal condition and retinal stress may be lager factors. </p><p>In my own situation, with a low minus Rx, the required introduction of significant prism (&gt;10 diopters BO) in each eye) caused apparent over correction that I could not deal with because of lack of accommodation.  The optometrist and the glasses maker could not explain the source of the problem because a another refraction and a check of the Rx in the glasses revealed that both were correct.  I wound up finding a "work around" to the problem by wearing a supplemental +1 lens (contact or clip-on) with the glasses.  With the supplemental +1 lens I have very near 20/20 vision with 15/15 BO to the amazement of both the optometrist and the optician (glasses maker).  I still do not know the exact cause, but I have several suspects in mind.  My vision is so good with +1 contacts and the glasses, that I haven't bothered to pin down the exact cause or combination of causes. </p><p>I had hoped that with your high myopia, you might be willing to help explore some possible causes, isolate them, and possibly even improve your vision with your glasses.  I am very suspicious that the combination of myopic eyeball elongation and the eye socket shape press inward on the back of the eyeball as prism is introduced.  Pressing inward on the back of the eyeball causes the length of the eyeball to be reduced slightly which in turn changes the sphere Rx from the refracted Rx which is generally done with the eye pointed straight ahead looking through the optical center of the lens in the phoropter or trial lens frame.  I also think that incorrect optical center placement because of the prism is a factor and may cause an apparent change in cylinder correction and sphere power. </p><p>Could you provide your current Rx to refresh my memory? </p><p>C. </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;20 May 2010, 14:46</p><p>One of my problems with sports is that I tend to sweat more than other people so even if the glasses don't slide down my nose or if I use a strap, the lenses tend to steam up or sweat keeps dropping on the lenses, both of which doesn't necessarily improve my vision :)! However, even with that my vision is still better than without glasses. So some types of sports where I sweat a lot are just a big struggle. I haven't done any sports with the new glasses yet though. We'll see.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Vicki</b>&nbsp;20 May 2010, 13:59</p><p>Have any of you ladies ever worn your glasses during sex? I love to keep mine on while in bed. Not only can I see what is happening, I get to rip them off my face just as I am about to orgasm. Plus, sometimes my man will spray all over them so I can lick the lenses. You should try it sometime if you haven't already!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;20 May 2010, 12:50</p><p>Heather, </p><p> </p><p>You can try using a strap to hold  your glasses in place when you're doing something physically strenuous.  It's always worked well for me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;20 May 2010, 02:43</p><p>Heather </p><p> </p><p>I play tennis and run/jog a lot often wearing glasses. They are rimless with non-hinged bendy arms and thin lenses and are very light in a -5.00 prescription. </p><p> </p><p>They never slip and if you get the slightly larger lenses give a very good field of vision. </p><p> </p><p>Suggest you try these for sports and then wont find any 'down the nose' slipping problems.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 17:47</p><p>The seaweed looks very blurred :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 17:00</p><p>ehpc - If you swim without glasses at -7.00 you must see about as much (or as little!) above water as below water I would imagine.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 16:57</p><p>Glasses are the BEST!!! :) I seaswim a lot at around minus seven.However, that really isn't a problem.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 15:51</p><p>And - Your girlfrient is quite lucky. At -7.50 contacts are certainly a lot more comfortable than thick glasses. Unfortunately, my eyes don't tolerate contacts any more so I am stuck with glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>I am not really able to function any more even around the house without glasses (except for very simple tasks). Sports has become somewhat difficult because you tend to sweat quite a lot and then glasses slide down the nose and steam up. Playing tennis, which I like a lot, has become a major struggle for me with the glasses but it is impossible for me to see the ball without correction.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 15:41</p><p>Heather, my gf is fortunate that she can tolerate contacts really well as her rx in contacts is -7.5.  </p><p>Can you still manage around the house bare-eyed ? I know folk with strong prescriptions have commented on here before about how they still manage to go swimming and play sport so don't let it stop you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 15:06</p><p>And - I think there is quite a big difference between -4.00 and -5.00. At -4.00 you can still make out a few large items in the distance without correction but at -5.00 everything is a total blur. One of the problems is to get a haircut. When I wore contact lenses this was no problem of course. However, as I can only wear glasses now, I have to take them off during the haircut and then cannot really see my face or my hair although it is only about 1.5m away in the mirrot. Every time the hairdresser asks me a question how he should do the hair, I have to put on my glasses first to see what he has done so far. This can be quite an ordeal if he keeps asking questions.  </p><p> </p><p>I felt that I became quite dependent on glasses once my prescription was about -3.50 although even then I often did not wear my glasses at home for housework because I was still able to make out things roughly. Now, this is impossible. Even after taking a shower, the first thing I do is put on my glasses again. I also go for Yoga classes from time to time which is quite difficult for me with the glasses. On the one hand I have to wear them to see but on the other hand if you sweat a lot and have to do gymnastics, then they slide down your nose and you are barely able to keep them on. Therefore, I have to put them on and off all the time which is quite a hassle and sometimes almost defeats the purpose of Yoga being relaxing. That's qhy sometimes I keep thinking that maybe as someone who has to wear strong glasses you have to chosse hobbies that are "glasses-friendly"! </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 14:42</p><p>Heather, do you think there's much difference between -4 and -5. When did you start to feel dependent on your glasses ?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 14:32</p><p>I was corrected down to 20/20 but I am sure in a year's time we'll start at 20/40 or 20/60 again. I guess that is just my dilemma. -5.00 feels really strong now but I have to enjoy my time with only -5.00 until -6.00 or even more will come. This is quite frightening in a way. I already have 1.74 index lenses but who knows what's next!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 12:14</p><p>Clare, </p><p>Unfortunately, no.  6/7.5 is about the same as 20/25. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 11:38</p><p>Yes Jennifer, I am! Despite the reduction in my rx I've become entirely dependent on glasses except for computer and reading.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 11:21</p><p>On the correcting 20/20 discussion ... At my last contacts check up it was interesting that though I was a little ponderous about some of the letters on the 20/20 line he just put it down to the -0.50 of astigmatism. He presumably wasn't bothered enough to correct it as I figure I get 20/20 with both eyes. I guess it doesn't mean that I can't be corrected to 20/20 although I did have one prescription that said my corrected acuity was 6/7.5, is that better than 6/6 - I haven't a clue!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dee</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 10:31</p><p>Like lenses </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for explaining what cut in was. I have seen the term on the site before and did not know what it meant. Stated another way, I guess I have lots of cut in. Out of couriosity before I posted this, (and I had to buy a metric ruler) but my ear tips appear 35 mm in viewed through my glasses. On the lense itself, it looks like about 5 mm in from the outside of the lense. (BTW, my husband thought I had lost it while I tried this in the mirror.) </p><p> </p><p>I see 20/20 corrected and at my last eye doc appointment even made out 2 or 3 things on the next line I think, by luck and I had a good nights sleep the night before. My eye doc told me I should be happy as some myopes with a strong a prescription as mine cannot be fully corrected. I have no idea if that's right or wrong. I do know if I'm really tired things don't seem to look as sharp.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 08:51</p><p>Well Phil, lets hope you are now wearing your glasses full time???</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 07:50</p><p>With those nice frames and new thin lenses you can now just sit back and enjoy the inevitable stream of compliments!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 04:46</p><p>Phil - I hope it will stabilise soon. I can definitely feel that the RX is "real"!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 02:44</p><p>Nice choice of frames Heather. Don't worry about your rx: it's just strong enough to be "real" but not distorting. I had some increases in my minus rx in my late 30s. But then things stabilised. Last time my rx actually dropped from -4 to -3.25 (though I think somewhere in between would be right). The optician said that that was not unusual as one entered one's 50s. The next challenge for you will be the onset of presbyopia and varifocals!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 02:35</p><p>I went back to the optician first thing this morning and decided to get a new frame and new lenses. I ended up getting this frame </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.vision2you.co.uk/store/paul-smith-glasses/paul-smith/ps1017" target="_blank">http://www.vision2you.co.uk/store/paul-smith-glasses/paul-smith/ps1017</a> </p><p> </p><p>It is very different from the one I had previously. Somewhat smaller and much lighter. I had them put in 1.74 index lenses (as my insurance is going to pay for that). I got the lenses put into the frame within immediately and I am already wearing them now. They are PHANTASTIC!!!! Even the -5.00 left lens is really thin and they are very light compared to what I experienced before. The lenses feel really strong and intense though. After having worn them for an hour I'll probably feel the need to take a break until I get used to them.  </p><p> </p><p>I am so glad now!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;19 May 2010, 00:48</p><p>Like Lenses - Why do wear something stronger than you need for distance rather than wearing your actual prescription for distance vision and then wear a slightly weaker prescription for reading?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Like Lenses</b>&nbsp;18 May 2010, 22:21</p><p>Dee </p><p>  With your prescription there is no getting away from the facial distortion ( Cut in ) unless you would get myodiscs. </p><p>  I like the cut in,and flat front surfaces of glasses like yours. </p><p>  Do you have 20/20 with your glasses on?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Like Lenses</b>&nbsp;18 May 2010, 22:14</p><p>Heather </p><p>  At 36 with the amount of recent increase you need to hold reading material as close as possible,and perhaps get a pair of online glasses with -.50 more power,and wear these for most things except reading. </p><p>  I think that you need to do these things to stave off your next prescription from becoming bifocals. </p><p>  My actual prescription is -3.50 in each eye,but I wear -4.50 for everything but reading. I can read with the -4.50's but not real comfortable,unless my eyes are tired. My distance vision with them is 20/10.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DS</b>&nbsp;18 May 2010, 21:42</p><p>Heather, </p><p> </p><p>Go for some 1.61 lenses.  They're thinner than poly and have better optical properties.  At your prescription, going higher index has diminishing returns. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;18 May 2010, 20:35</p><p>To Heather - I'm real sorry you don't like your brilliant glasses.I wonder how the eye test went.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;18 May 2010, 20:32</p><p>Heather - the frames are absolutely great :) Couldn't do better :)And with thick lenses :) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dee</b>&nbsp;18 May 2010, 17:04</p><p>I was so excited to get smaller glasses with thinner high index lenses and especially to minimize the front view where it makes my ears look squished in. At -12 I was so happy to see how thin my lenses were but was then disappointed that my facial distortion was still there. The glasses person (I appologize, they must have a title) explained that light still needed to get back to my deformed eyes. I have adjusted to it now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;18 May 2010, 12:44</p><p>Brian - The stronger lens (-4.50) is about 6-7mm (about 1/4 inch) thick. You are right that this cannot be seen from the side since the frame hides the lens from the side but you can see the thickness well from the front. Also, the lenses are quite heavy because of the thickness. However, given that I might get a new prescription again next year, maybe I should not spend an extraordinary amount of money now and just stick to the Polycarbonate lenses even for the new prescription, although right now I cannot yet get used to the thought of wearing even thicker (and heavier) lenses. I need to give this some thought.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;18 May 2010, 12:08</p><p>Heather,  How thick are your current lenses with that frame?  I would think that frame would do a pretty good job hiding the thickness of the lenses and no one who is looking at them would even be able to tell they are very strong due to the way the frame would likely disguise the lense thickness. Even with that current frame, I still think you'll be ok with polycarbonate lenses.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;18 May 2010, 11:24</p><p>Heather - mine are 1.6 index</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;18 May 2010, 10:25</p><p>Brian - I am 36 already. That's why I am quite surprised that my prescription keeps increasing. I just got new frames last year but only realised afterwards that I should have bought smaller frames. This is the frame I have </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.smartbuyglasses.co.uk/designer-eyeglasses/Emporio-Armani/Emporio-Armani-EA-9465-MH9-24667.html" target="_blank">http://www.smartbuyglasses.co.uk/designer-eyeglasses/Emporio-Armani/Emporio-Armani-EA-9465-MH9-24667.html</a> </p><p> </p><p>Actually it's size 53 so I was wrong earlier. So the combination of frames and thick lenses is quite heavy but since the frames are still quite new I am hesitant to get new ones. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;18 May 2010, 09:56</p><p>Heather,  How old are you?  Usually when you get to you late 20's and early 30's your prescription will generally start to stabalize.  My prescription is -6.00 and -5.25 and I even have a 2D Base-In Prism correction in my glasses and have polycarbonate lenses in my glasses and the lenses in my glasses aren't that thick at all.  I did get a smaller frame which really does cut down on the thickness.  So that would be my advice, just get a smaller frame with the polycarbonate lenses and you should be in good shape.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;18 May 2010, 08:28</p><p>I just came back from my eye exam. As I had almost anticipated, there has been another increase although luckily not a really big one. Basically, I have now gone from -4.00 (right) / -4.50 (left) to -4.25 (right) / -5.00 (left).  </p><p> </p><p>What really annoys me though (apart from another increase in the power) is that the thinner lenses are much more expensive than I had thought, so I decided to do nothing right now and check with my insurance first how much they are going to pay.  </p><p> </p><p>I would be okay paying a lot for thinner lenses if I knew my prescription remained stable now but if there is another increase in a year I have to change the lenses again. This is really frustrating!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;18 May 2010, 05:25</p><p>I have an appointment for an eye exam today. I am keeping my fingers crossed! I am also planning to have thinner lenses put into my glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 May 2010, 14:56</p><p>Brian-16, </p><p>Would you please contact me at cactusjack1928@hotmail.com </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;17 May 2010, 12:58</p><p>Heather, </p><p> </p><p>My lenses range from 1/4-inch thick to 1/2-inch thick, depending on frame size of course.  And yes, it's the cost ($40 per pair as opposed to possibly hundreds) that keeps me in thick lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;17 May 2010, 12:52</p><p>Melyssa - I guess you are right. However, your prescription in regular plastic must be extremely thick. Do you get regular plastic for cost reasons or for other reasons? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;17 May 2010, 12:43</p><p>Heather, </p><p> </p><p>Be thankful you do not have to deal with glass lenses, as I did in the 1960s and early 1970s.  Even with my -9.00 RX, I still use regular plastic CR39 lenses in all of my frames, and a lot of them are larger than your size 52 glasses.  But then, I've had plenty of decades to get used to the thickness.  ;)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;17 May 2010, 12:03</p><p>I think if my prescription is still -4.00 / -4.50 I might get 1.67 lenses but if it has increased to -5.00 or more in at least one eye, I might even go for 1.74 lenses. That should do the trick!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;17 May 2010, 11:48</p><p>Clare - The optician recommended the Polycarbonate lenses which he said were thinner than regular plastic lenses. I guess this is true but they are still relatively thick for my prescription. What type of lenses do you have for a -3 prescription? I am wondering which type of lens I should go for? It will of course also depend on whether my prescription has remained constant or whether it has increased again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;17 May 2010, 11:36</p><p>Heather - I'm surprised your optician didn't recommend thinner lenses, even with my Rx, my optician said that above -3 there's no question that they're the best bet.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;17 May 2010, 10:38</p><p>Cactus Jack- I too have astigmatism in both eyes and was wondering if this is why I do not have 20/20. I should be getting an exam early this summer.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;17 May 2010, 08:57</p><p>Large frames are just the best, Heather :) Black rectangular plastic frames with wide sides? :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 May 2010, 05:50</p><p>Astra, </p><p>Yes, I have different lenses for distance, intermediate, and close.  They are called tri-focals.  The are very handy and work very well. I wore tri-focals before the surgery so there was no problem getting used to them. I also have a pair of single vision reading glasses that I wear when I am doing a lot of reading (in bed in particular).  I also opted for Monovision.  The power of my IOLs were selected to give close to 20/20 for distance in one eye and the other eye is slightly nearsighted (-1.50) for closer work.  My vision without glasses is not perfect because of some astigmatism, but I can function pretty well (including reading labels on medicine bottles) without them, if I have to get up at night.  I could have opted for multi-focal IOLs, but at the time (2001) they were not very good and I like being able to see well.  Most opthalmologists I have talked to will not fit multi-focal IOLs in people who like or need really sharp vision.  Curiously, the IOLs are about 6% more efficient in light transmission than natural lenses which means that I can see very well at night, but very bright days require sunglasses for comfort. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;17 May 2010, 05:48</p><p>I made the mistake last time that the frames I chose are for relatively large lenses (size 52) which increases the outer thickness of the lenses. Moreover, I selected Polycarbonate lenses which are supposed to be thinner than regular plastic lenses but they are still fairly thick. I think I will probably get the lenses replaced with thinner ones. That should make wearing the glasses more comfortable. However, since my last eye test is already almost a year ago, I might as well go for a new test before putting in the thinner lenses. I just hope that my prescription did not increase again because that might undo the effect of the thinner lens type. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 23:06</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>Since you have practically no accommodation, does that mean you need different rx for reading and distance?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 18:06</p><p>Heather - I reckon you are greatly into the self-image I described :)Fabulously healthy, fit, strong, confident, brainy, confident, self-assured.................and projecting the SLIGHEST bit of adorable feminine vulnerabilty by wearing thick glasses :) After all, wouldn't it be lovely to have a strong man around to take you home and look after you if you broke your hot glasses and didn't have another pair on you? :) Hey :) Hey:) And what a great image (and reality) too.................. :) Pete </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 15:01</p><p>Andrew, </p><p>You are very fortunate. To put that in English notation, 6/4 would be the same as 20/13.3 or a little better than 20/15 but not quite 20/10.  6/6 or 20/20 is typical good acuity for the general population, but there are exceptions where some people have a bit better than typical acuity.  The examiner probably thought that you were very happy with being able to see 6/4 and saw no reason to "improve" it.  There can be more causes than just refractive errors that cause a reduction in visual acuity. including optical quality and clarity of the cornea, crystaline lenses, aqueous humor, and the vitreous humor.  On top of all that, the performance of the retina can play a significant role. </p><p>Remember, humans really do not have superior eyesight compared to some creatures in the animal kingdom.  It has been said that some birds (e.g. eagles, hawks etc" have incredible visual acuity and could theoretically read newsprint at extreme distances and can spot a mouse at over a Km.  This is, of course, an example of the evolutionary process in action.  The birds with good eyesight got plenty to eat and reproduced.  Those with less acuity went hungry and died before they had a chance to pass on their genes. </p><p>Fortunately, in humans, superior eyesight is not directly necessary for survival though good corrected or uncorrected eyesight can be very helpful. </p><p>There are a few exceptions. Not so much so today, but in WW 2 superior eyesight really helped the survival of fighter pilots.  The farther away you could see an enemy aircraft the better chance you had of either engaging him favorably or if you had limited armaments, getting away before he saw you. </p><p>May I ask your age? </p><p>BTW, I'm 72 and have had my crystaline lenses replaced with IOLs, because of an unusual type of cataract.  I can be corrected to 20/15 and make out some letters on the 20/10 line.  Not bad for an oldster.  Remember, I have NO accommodation so the Rx has to be pretty close to my actual needs. </p><p>C.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 13:06</p><p>I had my CLs checked yesterday.   With the present lenses, I was able to read the 6/4 line (I hope I have got the numbers the right way round).   I just wonder what would have happened if the man checking my eyes had decided that 6/6 ought to be good enough for me and reduced the strength of my lenses until that is what I could see...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 12:49</p><p>Anyway, although thick minus lenses do have their own appeal, it is hot frames which get me going. Heavy minus does have it's own attraction, but so long as the frames are hot, the tiniest minus (or even plain glass) is fine for me:)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 12:46</p><p>Not at all. It isn't the 'dependence' that is attractive. The reverse, again. Wearing glasses is a sign of strong character - OVERCOMING the problem!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 11:44</p><p>Independent ... except for their dependence on strong glasses ... :)!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 11:40</p><p>Finally..........(for the moment:)) it is the fact that glasses make women look so BRAINY that is the turn-on :)Brainy, confident, self-assured and independent :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 11:37</p><p>And in any case, glasses are what overcome the problem!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 11:35</p><p>Short sight is indeed most certainly not a disability. Having no legs, as a friend of mine has, is a 'dsiability'.And I can tell you she does extremely well with her life.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 11:31</p><p>Not at all, Heather :) The complete reverse:) My philosophy is that if you have perfect health, you have EVERYTHING - EVERYTHING ELSE you can sort out, personal, professional, financial. I just meant it's a rather cool 'image' combination - serious (glasses) and fun (beachwear). Strictly the 'cool image' is what I meant :) Getting pleasure from other people's disabilities is indeed evil, and no-one believes that,and has reason to believe that, more than me. However, short sight is not a 'disability'. Pete</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 10:17</p><p>Melyssa - Yes, usually if they are diligent, they double-check whether you can actually read the same letters with the weaker lenses also. However, I noticed that some opticians don't necessarily want to spend that much time and they will just give you the higher power once you said that this seems to make things clearer. At least for me, a higher power usually "looks better" to me but I think sometimes it just makes things smaller and darker, making it look "nicer" but the additional power may not be strictly necessary.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 08:44</p><p>Heather, </p><p> </p><p>As for sports, I bowl (rather well for someone without a ton of strength), and I can see the pins (and more importantly, the arrows).  I am fortunate never to have had to wear glasses or goggles while swimming.  And I stopped playing softball before I started wearing glasses full time. </p><p> </p><p>As for your 2nd question, usually they start testing me with my current RX, and if I have trouble reading something, they make the test lens stronger.  They also give me the old "Which is better, 1 or 2" routine, and sometimes I have to try it a couple of times to make sure things aren't blurrier.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 08:37</p><p>Melyssa - do you do any sports with the glasses on. If you do, how do you cope? As explained in my previous post, this is my biggest struggle! </p><p> </p><p>On another note: I was wondering, if you have an eye test and the optician gradually increases the minus power, at least within a certain range, doesn't more power almost always make things at least as clear as less power even if you don't necessarily need all that power to see what you have to be able to see? So, in other words, if the optician doesn't thoroughly check whether you are actually able to read the same letters with less power, you end up with more power than you necessarily need. Also, since with more power the letters tend to look blacker, one might confuse this with "better".</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 08:28</p><p>Heather, </p><p> </p><p>I certainly hope you've reached your limit as far as your prescription is, as well.  As for me, I have no intention of getting that Lasix, as I know of 2 women for whom it has not worked properly, as opposed to 1 woman who is quite happy with hers.  And the people I know who had that RK done, now have to wear reading glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 08:28</p><p>For me by the far the worst part with having to wear these fairly strong glasses all the time, is doing sports. I play tennis frequently but the glasses part is a constant struggle, they keep sliding down the nose and steam up when you sweat and if you use one of these rubber bands or whatever they are called, then they can't slide any more but they steam up even more and sweat constantly drops on the lenses - a nightmare! Probably good to adopt new glasses-friendly hobbies! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 08:21</p><p>Melyssa - Given that your prescription stabilised at age 36, there is at least some hope for me on that front as I am 36 now! I guess I just have to learn how to cope with things as I think I am not a candidate for surgery either. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 08:12</p><p>Heather, </p><p> </p><p>I was 27 when I had the big jump, and my RX finally stabilized at 36.  I have worn glasses since age 8, and with my excessive astigmatism (3), I was never able to wear contacts.  Fortunately, I have lots of pretty pairs of glasses to wear.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 08:07</p><p>Melyssa - How old were you when your prescription stabilised? -9.00 is really strong. I guess it is more or less okay if you are able to wear contacts but being stuck with glasses with such a prescription must be quite something. I am already struggling with the -4 / -4.5. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 08:01</p><p>Heather, </p><p> </p><p>When I was half my current age, my prescription skyrocketed (possibly 2 more diopters to the negative side), and for a couple of weeks after I got my new glasses, the floor always seemed to look very close to me.  I told the ophthalmologist about it, and he said it was normal for things to seem a bit off for a little while after getting a much stronger prescription.  Fortunately for me, my eyes got used to the new lenses.  By the time I reached what is now 2/3 of my age, my RX was up to -9.00, and I deal with it just fine.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 08:01</p><p>Clare - 16 hours is still pretty good. I guess in theory I could still wear contacts. However, it is a constant struggle. Although my eyes don't become red or anything, they hurt quite a bit and I have to blink all the time to be able to see clearly for some reason. Too much of a hassle. A few years ago, I did not even notice I was wearings contacts. It is strange how things change sometimes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 07:24</p><p>Heather - I can understand that. I'm a 99% contacts wearer (the 1% constitutes wearing glasses at home) and am not particularly tolerant of contacts - I can do up to about 16 hours max (although not always), yet friends of mine can go longer. Afraid I'm probably not one to encourage as I'd feel exactly the same!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 07:13</p><p>Clare - Thanks for your response. I certainly hope that this experience is not indicative of my future prescription but I guess I just have to wait and see! Also, after wearing only contact lenses for many years, my eyes don't tolerate them any more, so I have to wear glasses whatever the prescription is. Even the -4.00 / -4.50 glasses are still quite a nuisance to me (even after having them for about 9 months). It is hard to go suddenly from 100% contact lens wear to wearing glasses full time especially if you have quite a strong prescription and need thick lenses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 07:00</p><p>Sorry, I meant that my Rx now is similar to that prescribed a few years ago ... but didn't check the post before hitting send, duh!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;16 May 2010, 06:59</p><p>Heather - I had a similar experience a few years ago. I went in to the test with a prescription of -1.50 and -1.75 but came out with one of -2 and -3.50. I was quite upset and came away with contacts of -1.75 and -3. I wasn't at all happy and didn't feel the prescription was right so, like you, went back and came away with a prescription for -2.25 both eyes. Years later my Rx is -2.75 and -3 -0.50 x 140. With the benefit of time it's easy to say that my current Rx isn't so different from the one that I wear now. I'll never know if I just couldn't cope with it then or, coincidentally, just ended up somewhere near it. Whatever, you're right to go back and - yes, other people have similar experiences. Not good.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Heather</b>&nbsp;15 May 2010, 20:44</p><p>I am new to this site. I have been wearing glasses for the past 18 years  but recently had quite a strange experience in an eye test.  </p><p> </p><p>I came to the eye test wearing -3.50 (right) and -4.00 (left) glasses. They then tested me with that prescription but I wasn't able to see all the letters properly so they increased my prescription relatively quickly asking whether I could see better with the additional power which I confirmed. When they had found the right prescription, they added this prescription to trial frames and asked me to walk around the store with the trial frames on and then asked me whether I was able to see well and whether things looked very far away and small or distorted. However, I thought things looked kind of okay. They then removed the trial frames and told me that my prescription had increased to -4.50 -0.75 (right) and -4.75 -0.75 (left). I was quite shocked when I heard about that, especially since I thought I had been able to see relatively well with my old glasses. They then immediately put the new lenses into my existing frames within one hour. Although the lenses were high-index, I thought they were still REALLY thick!  I had never thought that I would need such thick lenses. At first the vision was okay (however, somehow really intense) but once I had kept them on for several hours, my eyes hurt badly and my vision was distorted as well. I then called the optician but they said that this was normal given the relatively large prescription increase. So I persisted and even went on holiday for a week taking only these glasses with me. However, besides all my friends making fun of me walking around the beach with really thick lenses, my hurt more and more and I ended up wearing no glasses at all during the last few days of the holidays but it had become unbearable. Once I was home again I went to see another optician at the same store telling her about my problems and she tested my eyes again and found that my new prescription was only -4.00 (right) and -4.50 (left). Quite a differnce from before! So had these lenses put into my old frame immediately and since then things have been a lot better. However, it seems strange to me that made such a large error.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2010, 08:05</p><p>Not sure, </p><p>You are correct, but what actually happens is that objects stay about the same size vertically (along the axis) and object are shrunk along the horizontal axis because of the minimizing effects of a minus lens.  They tend to make people look thinner. </p><p>However, you should remember that the job of the minus cylinder correction is to neutralize or cancel out the increased 90 degrees of  plus cylinder power in an astigmatic cornea.  Uncorrected 90 degree plus cylinder in the cornea will make people look fatter, but the brain can fix that problem.  What it can't fix is the two different focus points in the vertical and horizontal axes.  It requires an external lens to do that. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Apr 2010, 08:14</p><p>Clare </p><p>That machine you refer to I must admit I have not seen, but my guess is that it is designed to give the best possible vision correction. When it refracted you to -3.50 most likely you would have been able to see the 20/10 line on the eye chart had you ordered glasses based on that. As we all know doctors only want to correct to 20/20. I have known several opticians that after getting their annual exam have increased their rx by -.50 because they wanted that that extra clearity for themselves.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2010, 23:27</p><p>Hollie - the only interaction was with a human who led people to the testing machine. Interestingly it was also possible to have a full test but they were equally prepared to make up a pair of glasses based on the electronic test result. Given that I once had one of those give me a reading of -3.5 a few years ago at Boots Opticians I have never trusted them, I was really only -2.75 in th end.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hollie</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2010, 12:26</p><p>Clare </p><p>So there is no contact with a human examiner?? I know the refraction I've had has been a diopter or so above my final prescription before (my most recent eyetest it was almost bang on!) - is over refraction common I wonder? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2010, 00:08</p><p>A couple of years ago I bought some glasses in India where they are very cheap compared to UK prices. There they test remotely too - the customer looks into a machine which produces a ticket like a receipt with the prescription printed on it. Like the early stages of a regular eye exam but that's it. I didn't have the test as I had my prescription with me but I wonder how pleased people who bought glasses based on that refraction might have been?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2010, 21:08</p><p>Dave, </p><p>Your math is correct.  Ideally, the check of distance vision should be done with the target object is so far away that the rays of light from the object arrive at the cornea, parallel.  For all practical purposes, the light rays from small letters 20 ft or 6 meters away arrive at the cornea so close to parallel, that it doesn't matter.  If the target is closer, they light rays are not parallel. </p><p>Mirrors can work because they ideally reflect the parallel light rays by the same amount, maintaining their parallel relationship.  The snag with the mirrors is that they are probably NOT front surface mirrors (that is what you find in high precision optics and telescopes) because they are very expensive and very fragile.  Light being reflected by a back surface mirror must encounter the front surface before being reflected and angular errors can be introduced.  Fortunately, the error isn't large, but it can be there and I think you get more accurate result when the chart is really 20 ft or 6 meters away. </p><p>As I mentioned in a previous post I was not impressed by the quality of the refraction done with the clever optics and probably very high priced curved mirror.  As our UK friends say, "It was too clever by half".  I haven't been back to that ECP.  The refraction just didn't look right and I didn't bother to get the glasses made. </p><p>I have not heard too many complaints about Zenni and very few complaints about Optical 4 Less.  If you get a low cost frame, Zenni is so inexpensive you can afford to try them and toss the glasses if you don't like them. </p><p>C. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2010, 18:23</p><p>CJ, </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for your detailed answer.  I wondered if the mirror distance was less than 20'.  The distance for .25D of myopia to kick in is 4m (13+ feet) - is that correct? </p><p> </p><p>I think I will do the online buy next time.  I've been thinking of that for cost also.  I seem to spend at least $250 per year for lens updates.  Seems like I could get glasses and lenses a lot cheaper online. </p><p> </p><p>I've not heard of quality issues with online retailers.  Any complaints out there?  I have strong astigmatism 1.75, 2.25 so I notice if the cylinder is out by any significant amount. </p><p> </p><p>Dave </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus jack</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2010, 13:59</p><p>Dave, </p><p>Ideally, the distance is 20 feet, often reflected by a mirror in small offices.  I agree with you that the very best refractions seem to be done with a true direct 20 feet, but that arrangement seems to be rare these days.  I have also been refracted with a remotely controlled phropter and what seemed to be a very fancy curved mirror about  5 feet from the phropter.  The resulting Rx left a lot to be desired. </p><p>Also, optometrists seem to be trained to be stingy with the minus and correct only until the 20/20 line is readable with a little effort.  I personally prefer the 20/20 line to be very crisp with some of the letters on the 20/15 line to be easily readable. </p><p>It might be worthwhile to tell the examiner that you prefer very sharp vision even if you are slightly over corrected.  Prescribing in 0.25 steps does not always result in the best Rx and I have known some ECPs to prescribe in 0.125 steps, but that is very rare. </p><p>If that doesn't work, just order your glasses online with -0.25 more than prescribed.  </p><p>Remember, you have to live with the results. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

This time I was seeing double images with the left eye especially at night looking at street signs. </p><p> </p><p>Near the end of the refracting process (presumably step 4) he asked which was clearer.  I think I unexpectantly chose the higher minus.  He asked me all kinds of questions, why does it look clearer?  Is it actually clearer, or just darker.  I said it's smaller but clearer.  I was looking at a small letter p and said that the round part looks a little better filled in. </p><p> </p><p>I think he was trying to hold back the minus power and my answer convinced him to go with it.

<p><b>Adam</b>&nbsp;22 Jan 2010, 13:10</p><p>Hello I've just been prescribed glasses for the first time, am abit surprised as hadnt noticed that I had been having any vision problems! Was just wondering if anybody had any stories on how they first found out they needed glasses, and also the best way to let friends and family know.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2009, 12:31</p><p>Astra, re your friend Kate, what often happens with new, youngish myopes (I think you said that was what she was) is that before they get their first myopia correction, their accomodative eye muscles are very good (actually, more good than they ought to be) at relaxing for a given visual distance and thus they automatically get a kind of free correction (but not all of it) thanks to being young and having a generally more flexible visual system. </p><p> </p><p>This means when they walk in off the street and get their first prescription, they can see down to say 20/80 but get an RX that would correct someone apparently able to see only say 20/200 or more. This is because the optician knows there is more myopia there than is apparent, and it is being masked by the eye's ability to relax. </p><p> </p><p>Why the apparent overcorrection? Well - firstly it's not really overcorrection, and also in later years payback will come because the eye muscles are still strong enough to accomodate without bifocals. </p><p> </p><p>It is not unknown for people of Kate's age to see 20/100 and get prescribed -5 of correction. Also - when she takes off her glasses, is there a few seconds when everything is really blurred, then it reverts to something like the state before she got glasses? If so, her eyes are starting to become accustomed to the correction - but not wholly.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2009, 11:42</p><p>Due to my recent difficulties on reading text, I've consulted an eye doctor for further eye check.  </p><p> </p><p>He told me there are no pathologic eye problems detected, but my visual acuity for reading is inadequate, which was 0.2. Distance acuity is 20/30 with the best correction, which is worse than 20/20 last time. My distance acuity without is 20/100. </p><p> </p><p>That means I can't read text smaller than 14 pt without the aid of magnifying tools, even at reading distance, with the reading add. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2009, 11:18</p><p>Puffin, regarding the age of Kate. She was 20.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2009, 11:17</p><p>Puffin, I have mentioned some of the phenomenon observed for Kate (my friend) on the thread "Going without glasses".  </p><p> </p><p>Of course there are more observation, they seem to be more relevant to this thread.  </p><p> </p><p>About some tricks mentiioned on "Going without glasses" thread. It was easy, close the indoor lighting at night, and I ask Kate to describe the shape of the slit (which is thin, rectangular). There we have my own old glasses (no, I wasn't wearing them) with a prescription of -2.0. If she could see past the -2.0, then she probably got over-correction. But with -2.0 on, Kate told me it was almost like no change from without, still blurry. I have a -2.5, and let Kate to try them on, and this time she told me it is somewhat better, but still unable to see the slit properly.  </p><p> </p><p>Kate has to use her -3.5 to see properly. Everything from 0 to -2.5 doesn't really help much, since her visual acuity without was 20/80; with -2.5 correction, she probably got 20/40.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Angie</b>&nbsp;10 Oct 2009, 07:50</p><p>Latte, </p><p> </p><p>The 3 base out means that the thickness will be at the outer edge, by the temple.  I have glasses with 4 base out, and wear those when I have a lot of files to read at work, or a great new book that will lead to hours of reading.  I don't think the thickness at the edge will be very noticeable, but that may also depend on your prescription, on top of the prism. Are you near or farsighted?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>latte</b>&nbsp;10 Oct 2009, 06:56</p><p>Hi not sure if this is the right thread to use.  I have just been prescribed prism in my lenses, it will be a 3 base out. I however forgot to ask him if it will make my lenses thicker and for base out prism where will the thickness of the lens be? can anyone help me until I get to chat to my optom on Monday?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Like Lenses</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2009, 19:08</p><p>Obsessed </p><p> You are correct. In my case my uncorrected vision is 20/450 in each eye, and I can see 20/20 with my prescribed -3.50 glasses, but I wear a pair of overcorrected -4.50 to induce myopia, and have 20/10 with them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Obsessed</b>&nbsp;05 Oct 2009, 18:24</p><p>Astra, the vision acuity only partly depends on the refractive power of the eye.

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;05 Oct 2009, 01:45</p><p>Reading one of my old post on this thread got me amused now. On that post, I've try to imply there could be direct relationship between prescriptions  and visual acuity.  </p><p> </p><p>Throughout this year I got really convinced that prescription does not have "linear relationship" with visual acuity. Prescription and visual acuity are entirely different things, even though stronger prescription would likely to cause lower visual acuity because of the limited ability to accommodate with the off-focused image. </p><p> </p><p>I was amazed when I saw one of my friend with a prescription of about -3.50 going bare eyed because she lost her glasses. I got curious and asked her about her visual acuity on her last eye test, and she told me it was 20/80.   </p><p> </p><p>20/80 sounds more like the expected acuity for an uncorrected -1.5 to -2.0 , I wonder how is that possible... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>happy</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2009, 10:02</p><p>I have just posted to the induced myopia thread - but perhaps my question is more relevant to this forum.  I have had a relatively stable prescription of about -4 for about 10 years until the last 3 years when my myopia has incresed - reconfirmed today by a further increase in my prescription to R -7.75 cly -0.25 and L -8.25.  I wondered if anyone could tell me why I have started to increase my myopia, and if it is likely to continue at this rate?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2009, 02:51</p><p>guest </p><p> </p><p>Maybe one reason the optometrist wants your friend to visit in only a year is to check other issues regarding eye health. At my last eye test, the pressure in one eye was borderline on the limit and so I too was asked to come back in one year rather than two. </p><p> </p><p>Distance prescription can decrease with age but there is no rule to this, my sphere went up -0.25 in one eye, the first change for twelve years! Also my add at +2.00 remained the same as itï¿½s been for six years. </p><p> </p><p>The bottom line of your friendï¿½s prescription is that with her right eye she will only have +0.25 of plus to help her reading, and only +1.00 in the left eye. It is a negligible amount in the right eye and will make hardly any difference as it almost like not wearing glasses, and for the left it is the lowest amount that OTC readers can be purchased with. </p><p> </p><p>If she can read well with just her right eye than the prescription may be sufficient, although on the scale of things at age 48 it is on the low side. Your optometrist sounds well qualified but should be open to hear concerns that the prescription may not fulfil her reading needs. He should have done the test for reading and computer acuity and possibly your friend could ask if with the trial lenses she can read a book or paper, and also look at a computer screen. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 08:41</p><p>Another question? How much if any does the added cylinder make? Since it is such a small amount, I'm wondering if even that will be helpful with her near vision? Isin't it much more common for people nearing the age of 50 to see a decrease in their myopia and an added need for correction for reading? I wonder what the optometrist meant when he told her that now that her correction for distance isin't so"off" this will make her overall vision much improved, at all distances? My friend told me that he acted as though he assumed she wore her glasses full time, and as I mentioned earler believes she will need changes again in a year. He told her never to wait for 3 yrs to have her eyes examined, as she had. He is a very reputable optometrists that works under the direction of an opthalmology group.    </p><p> </p><p>Again Thanks!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 07:49</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I believe her rx is od sp- -2.00 cyl-+.50 add 2.25. os sp--1.25 cyl +.50 add 2.25. Like I said her previous rx had no cylinder and was .75 less in ea eye, but the add was 2.25. She went because she has been experiencing problems with computer and reading for long periods of time. She fully intended to be told that her presbyopia was increasing as she is now 3 yrs older. She told me that she doesn't see to have a problem with her distance and she usually only wears her glasses at work and to read. She was very surprised when asked to read the chart (at a distance) with her glasses on and she couldn't read beyond 20/50 or so. Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't this new rx show an actual decrease in the add strength, as her rx is stronger for distances? How will this rx be helpful with the computer and reading? </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for your Insight!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 07:34</p><p>guest, </p><p> </p><p>If your friend's prescription for astigmatism was written as a "+", which is the practice for ophthalmologists in the USA, that amount is added to the sphere.  In otherwords, a prescription of -1.00 with a +.50 added would become -1.50 +.50 followed by the angle (with no actual increase in myopia).  It might help to determine the actual increase if you tell us the entire RX before and now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 07:01</p><p>guest </p><p> </p><p>I really donï¿½t know what the Dr. means by ï¿½distance vision being offï¿½. Do you know what your friendï¿½s add is? If it is a high add e.g. +3.50, then it might presently be overcompensating with the result that reading for long periods is difficult, and now the sphere has been increased, it is correct. </p><p> </p><p>If the new prescription is correct and her present add is, say +2.00, then her new prescription would give her the same (except for a small improvement with astigmatism correction) reading acuity without glasses as with glasses, because a +2.00 add would cancel out the -2.00 sphere. </p><p> </p><p>Let us know what the add is, and we can work out a simple test using over the counter readers to see what the result would be. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 05:57</p><p>OOPs, Post below is from me! Guest</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 05:56</p><p> She said that when she went to the optometrist, the only problem she had been having with her current rx is for reading for long periods of time and working on the computer (with glasses on). She does work at a computer all day and reads alot on weekends as well. Her computer screen is about 3 feet away. She then mentioned that when the Dr had her read the line on the chart with her glasses on she thinks it was 20/30 line she couldn't read at all with either eye. Her right eye couldn't see the 20/40 line either. Her former rx was only about -1.00 in left and -1.25 in right. She now also has a minimal rx for astigmatism in both eyes +.50. Both eyes had an increase in sphere of .75. She is concerned about filling the rx (as you mentioned) because no accomodations were made for reading. She told me the Dr said that when "your distance rx is as "off" as hers, that effects vision at all distances". He told her that she shouldn't wait 3 yrs to return as her eyes seem to be changing quickly. Should she fill this rx? I'm still concerned about the rx that I have received being correct, and haven't filled it. We are now both in a quandry.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Like Lenses</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 01:28</p><p>guest </p><p> Has she been doing a lot of near work, or computer work?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 01:10</p><p>guest </p><p> </p><p>The sphere increase of -0.75 itself is a little unusual at age 48 as usually the eyes have stabilised by this time. What is your friendï¿½s full prescription?  You said she is slightly myopic and so this increase would seem to be quite high. </p><p> </p><p>As you say, one would think the add would also increase to compensate for the additional sphere correction unless her current add is sufficient. However, at 48 her presbyopia is likely to have increased over three years. </p><p> </p><p>It may be worth having the prescription checked by the optometrist before it is filled because it is possible he has made a mistake. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2009, 18:01</p><p> </p><p>A friend of mine who is 48, as I am had an eye exam today. She hasn't had an exam in 3 years and is slightly myopic and presbyopit.

<p><b>LD</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2009, 02:05</p><p>Actually, I've always preferred being undercorrected. I just like the impressionist way of life more than the realist's.  </p><p>In any case,I remember about a year and a half ago when I gave up contacts that my sight was quite bad, with contacts but even more with my glasses. No problem, I didn't mind, so I didn't have my eyes checked or anything. Then this spring things were getting sharp. In retrospect I can say I just felt my eyes getting better, although at that moment I was just puzzled, looking at the trees and seeing all the young leaves in different shades, amazing that was. It was a bit like when I started wearing contacts at 19, I just couldn't get over it how things looked. My idea then was that the beauty of nature struck me because last year I was mostly at home with a terrible pregnancy, feeling bad all day. Thinking about it now though, it wasn't just my mind feeling better.  </p><p>The whole thing does keep me busy all day, even all night. At first, I had these euphoric dreams, but now I notice I'm feeling anxious. I dreamt I was going abroad by train and starting to panic because I didn't bring my glasses, having convinced myself I don't need them anymore. I suddenly realised I was going to need them at some point, but there was no going back...  </p><p>So I guess I'm going to keep them on just a bit more and see what happens.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sum1wholovesgirlswithglasses</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2009, 21:37</p><p>LD im not an expert but i suspect that your glasses were likely overcorrected without  noticing,according to some ophthalmologist's assistant i had found on different forums a lot of young patients really prefer being over minused  cause they believe more minus equals improvements in visual acuity or overall sharpness,its nearly impossible that your last pregnancy was the cause of a decrease in myopia,nearsightedness usually gets worse or stay pretty much the same</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2009, 12:40</p><p>LD - I wouldn't worry about feeling guilty if you prefer what you see with glasses. I suppose the psychological effect is different when your rx is going down to when its going up. I can understand if you'd taken some time to get used to it, like me, then it must feel weird. But if you've become comfortable with wearing glasses then you should carry on. Folks here will say there's no absolute that says when anyone should, or shouldn't, wear glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>I think my rx is pretty stable now although I've never tried to increase it. I've never really taken to wearing glasses - as people here will testify -so I wear contacts. For a long time I would go avoid wearing glasses when I couldn't wear contacts. I have a pretty good relationship with contacts now so that rarely happens.  </p><p> </p><p>I'm sure others here will have some hmore scientific thoughts on what's  going on with your eyesight as I'm no expert.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LD</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2009, 10:19</p><p>Clare </p><p> </p><p>I don't even really notice the difference, I can do the same things without glasses now as I used to.  </p><p>And enjoying it, I don't know. I'm actually feeling a bit confused, having spent a lot of money on new glasses and possibly having to buy new lenses again (and again and again?). I should have thought about further improvement before buying new glasses.  And also, I'd finally got used to wearing glasses (and seeing well) all the time, and now I'm afraid I'll be able to do without most of the time, but having to sacrifice sharp sight. Most people (as I did 13 years ago) go the other way and become full time wearer after living with some blur. I think now it will be hard to do that again. Of course I can still wear glasses all the time, but I'll actually feel a bit guilty. I guess most people here don't understand that.  </p><p>Do you have problems with your eyes deteriorating or were you hoping for it?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2009, 12:21</p><p>LD - congratulations! A long time ago I read that distant vision tends to improve ahead of presbyopia but I guess you have a while to go before that. I've also heard pregnancy is more likely to increase your myopia rather than decrease it. Sorry, not being hugely helpful. </p><p> </p><p>But these things don't go to plan it seems. My prescription has been increasing through my 30s which is not that usual and I'm now at -3 and -2.75.  Are you enjoying your improved vision, or does it just seem strange not to need glasses so often?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LD</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2009, 06:41</p><p>Hi </p><p> </p><p>I'm not sure if anyone can help me with this, but how can improvement in vision be explained? </p><p>I'm 31 and have had around -4, -3,75 for about 10 years, but at some point found myself seeing sharp with my -3,5, -3,25 glasses. After some more months I got headaches, especially when reading with my glasses on, although I preferred not wearing them all the time.  </p><p>A visit to the eye doctor taught me I now have only -3, -2,5! Wearing my new glasses again I seem to be getting headaches. Possibly my eyes are getting better still? </p><p>I'm really curious what may be causing this. Could it be not working currently, having less/no stress? Could it have to do with my last pregnancy or breastfeeding?  Could a treatment by an osteopath (for neck problems) have helped? </p><p>of course I'm glad with the improvement, but I'm also a little bit afraid. After having hated my nearsightedness for 15 years, I now fear losing it! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 May 2009, 15:09</p><p>Philpit, </p><p>Yes, but it is up to the wearer to determine if the corrected vision provides enough benefit for full time wear.

<p><b>Philpit</b>&nbsp;30 May 2009, 14:25</p><p>Hi Cactus </p><p>Interesting that full time wear is recommended at such low levels of astigmatism. Is that common?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 May 2009, 03:56</p><p>bon, </p><p>She probably suggested full time wear was because of the cylinder correction for your astigmatism.  Astigmatism affects vision at all distances and is usually most noticeable when reading small print. It isn't too bad at low levels, but it causes increased fatigue because it is impossible for your eyes to focus properly for sharp, comfortable vision without external correction. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bon</b>&nbsp;30 May 2009, 03:20</p><p>Clare, no the doctor didn't explain, and I'm afraid I didn't ask. </p><p> </p><p>She was kind of surprised when I told her that I didn't wear my old glasses all the time. The old prescription was similar to the new one, but without astigmatism correction.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;29 May 2009, 11:40</p><p>bon - did he say/did you ask why the recommendation to wear them all the time? Especially given that you think you see okay without them some of the time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 May 2009, 07:42</p><p>bon, </p><p>Astigmatism can develop over time. it does not increase like myopia, but it does change.  Astigmatism is usually the result of unevenness in the curvature of cornea whereas myopia is the result of a mismatch between the total optical power of your cornea and crystaline lens and the length of your eyeball.  Changes in myopia are usually caused by growth and elongation of the eyeball. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2009, 06:45</p><p>Well Andy, if your vision was all right and you don't want to wear glasses, why did you go for a test? Could it be that somebody observing you thought you weren't seeing as well as you thought you were? Honestly, it's up to you whether you get glasses now or in a year or two when your eyes have got worse - as they almost certainly will, because it's in the nature of short sight to get shorter. You can put off the evil hour until that myopia really starts to bite -  or you can get them now and have them handy for those moments when you find you can't see the cinema screen or the TV or the destination of the bus that's approaching. It really is up to you. How old are you by the way? I'm guessing between 16 and 20.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andy</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2009, 08:15</p><p>Ok so you would recommend getting glasses? As i hadnt noticed anything wrong with my vision before the test, and am not that keen on having to wear glasses!! If i did get them when would i need them?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2009, 08:08</p><p>Andy: it means you are a little bit short-sighted and have a little bit of astigmatism.

I would not be surprised if certain states allow driving at age 14.  Either way, a person must have vision corrected to near 20-20, whatever the exact number may be by state. I began wearing glasses fulltime at 16 just so I could be allowed to drive.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2008, 10:26</p><p>Nikki, </p><p>Yes, that is correct.  You simply cannot tell how well a person sees by the power of their glasses.  Remember, the only function of the corrective lenses is to provide sharp focus on the retina, the "film" in the biological camera.   </p><p>We do not yet fully understand how the biological image processing of "vision" works.  However, we are making progress by doing it artifically.  A good example, if you recall, are the early images of the Hubble Space Telescope that were so out of focus as to be nearly unusable.  By applying massive computer resources, it was possible to improve the images enough to make them useful.  Yet, by the simple fitting of the "camera" aboard the telescope with "glasses", the images were rendered spectacularly sharp and revealing of the wonders of the universe.  Admittedly, the effort required to determine the "prescription" and get the lenses into place were huge, but it was worth it and now the computer resources can be put to other uses. </p><p>I guess you could say the same thing about vision correction with glasses or contacts.  It frees up the brain to do more constructive tasks.  But, of course, if you weren't planning on using your brain for anything anyway, it might as well be trying to process blurry images. </p><p>C.   </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>benn</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2008, 07:18</p><p>I think Catus Jack is sage with his comments. What is a problem to one is of little notice to another. </p><p> </p><p>I demand sharp vision, my wife does not. At times she does not know if she has her lenses in or not. </p><p> </p><p>I am always testing my vision by checking signs or car plates to make sure I am, seeing correctly.  </p><p> </p><p>My wife never looks. I will say to her read that sign, and she can't and I say doesn't that bother you? and she says "no, I know there is a sign so why do I need to read it" </p><p> </p><p>It flips me out.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nikki</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2008, 06:54</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p>When you say - brain is perfectly capable of creating its own images without any input from the eyes - to me that suggests that even people with very bad vision can get by because the brain is cleverer. </p><p> </p><p>I was thinking of being more charitable when seeing someone who has a very low prescription, thinking that perhaps they could still have vision as bad as someone with a much stronger one. ie that people who look like they have low prescriptions may have worse sight than you'd guess from their glasses. Does that make sense?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2008, 06:29</p><p>Nikki, </p><p>Yes, the actual optical correction required for BCVA is loosely related to quality of vision.  After an image is sharply focused, actual visual acuity depends very much on the condition of the retina, its image pre-processing capability, condition of the optic nerve, and image processing capability of the brain.  Obviously, the Garbage In - Garbage Out rule for computers applies here also.  The brain's image processing capability can "improve" on poor image quality, but in general, it must know what something is supposed to look like to be effective and it takes time and effort.   </p><p>The brain is perfectly capable of creating its own images without any input from the eyes.   </p><p>For example: dreams, halucinations, and simply seeing thing as you wish they were rather than as they really are. Another ready example is the graphic images used on some web sites to veryify that a human is responding rather than a computer.  Humans are extremely good at pattern matching and a human can recognize a familiar pattern and decipher the letters easily, but a computer can't without considerable effort.  Try identifying the letters in the image if it is blurry. </p><p>I chuckle at those who "heroically" go without their glasses and expound on how well they can function.  If you were to put them in an unfamiliar environment, where they had not "seen" what something was supposed to look like, and remove the supporting clues (audio for instance), they would be lost. If you put them in an environment where images change rapidly, they HAVE to perform, and "instant" evaluation of the situation is necessary, such as driving, they would be positively dangerous to themselves and others. </p><p>As you can see, the causes of poor vision are many and varied.  Sharply focusing the images on the retina is only one very important element in good vision.  Simply saying they need -1.50 or -3.00 or they only see 20/50 doesn't say much about how well they "see". </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nikki</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2008, 02:53</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p>Does that mean then  </p><p>- that two people with -2 could see entirely differently? </p><p>- that someone with -1.5 might see as bad as someone with -3 </p><p> </p><p>Do you know what it is that causes it? </p><p>Thanks </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2008, 19:43</p><p>eyespy, </p><p>The eye is simply a biological camera and the purpose of corrective lenses of any Rx is to focus images on the retina.  Quality of vision (Acuity) is determined by how well the retina and the brain process the images to produce vision.  A vision exam hopefully results in what is called Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) and it must be based on the patient's response because, while the examiner can determine pretty closely how well the images are focused on the retina, it is impossible for the examiner to know how well someone actually sees.  In that regard, the examiner must depend on what the patient says. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eyespy</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2008, 13:57</p><p>Just wondering since I read recently that uncorrected visual acuity differs even between two people who have the same prescription, does the eye dr know what you can see from the chart? </p><p> </p><p>Has anyone come across someone with a similar prescription whose eyesight is much better/worse than theirs? </p><p> </p><p>It must be possible that people like Kelly and Emma with low prescriptions sometimes have eyesight much worse than you'd imagine for that prescription?

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2008, 12:19</p><p>Sandra - this takes me back a bit! I was about 27 or 28 when I first got glasses, a weak prescription that meant I was legal for driving. That's all I wore them for. It crept up and in the early -2s I got contacts but I didn't always wear them, just for sport. I finally went fulltime with contacts around -2.75.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sandra S.</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2008, 07:32</p><p>And, I don't really have interesting stories, since I usually wear my glasses when I need to, for driving, watching tv, movies and other activities that require good distance vision.  </p><p>I don't wear them outdoors during the day because my vision is good enough in the bright light. As soon as it gets dark, my vision becomes poor, and I put on my glasses. </p><p>I also don't wear them at home (except for tv), and at work, because I work on the computer and don't need glasses to see the screen. </p><p> </p><p>Well, there was one embarrassing moment without glasses at my work: I was walking with my colleague along a rather long corridor, when I spotted another colleague approaching on the other end. I greeted him, saying his name, only to find that it is not my colleague, but my boss! I was so embarrassed.

<p><b>presbyope Challenged</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2008, 18:04</p><p> Cactus Jack, Thanks. I suspect that her ciliary muscles are better than most. For example, we were out to dinner the other night and she was able to get through the menu without glasses. Meanwhile at another table was a couple we knew with a woman the same age and she immediately pulled out her reading glasses. But my wife does like to read in bed and she always does it bare eyed with the book about 10 inches from her face. And she always has contacts or glasses on, claiming she is absolutely blind without them. I am hoping that the progressive lenses are quite satisfactory so that even with contacts she uses her reading glasses more frequently.  it has become quite apparent that when she goes to read something she is pulling her head back, but I do not think she has embraced reading glasses yet, although she says they are better than regular glasses</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2008, 09:32</p><p>Jenny, </p><p>Glad to be of help.  I hope you kept your single vision glasses. Even with the bifocals, your ciliary muscles are having to work some for intermediate distances and reading and they will gradually become re-conditioned.  You may find that in a few months you don't need the bifocals except for very lengthy close tasks. </p><p>Please let us know from time to time how you are getting on. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2008, 09:24</p><p>Presbyope Challenged, </p><p>The relationship between age and the amount of external focusing help required is an extremely loose one.  There are two elements to presbyopia, stiffness of the crystaline lens and conditioning of the cilary muscles.  Stiffness of the crystline lens is somewhat related to age, but genetics and the biochemical environment for the lenses is more significant.  Conditioning and responsiveness of the cilary muscles is almost unrelated to age.  People with uncorrected myopia in the -1.00 to -3.00 range are particularly susceptible to de-conditioning of the ciliary muscles because they don't have to use them much.  As cases in point, Phil's and perhaps Jenny's comments nearby about  focusing problems in their early 20s when their -2.00 and -1.50 myopia was first corrected.  I suspect their crystaline lenses were and are quite flexible, but with -2.00 and -1.50 uncorrected, they were / are in effect wearing +2.00 or +1.50 readers all the time and their brain and cilary muscles forgot how to focus.  Over time, with effort and probably some discomfort, the cilary muscles and the control system for could re-train and re-learn how to do it. But, re-training the cilary muscles isn't much different than any other muscle building course: No Pain, No Gain. And, it doesn't happen overnight. Sometimes temporary bifocals will help with the re-training.  You don't start weight lifting with 50 Kg. </p><p>I think if you are patient and make the right and timely supportive comments, your wife will accept the fact that her uncorrected vision is really limiting her quality of life and she will come around. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jenny</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2008, 09:09</p><p>To All, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for all the advice.  This place is really a Godsend.  I went back this morning, told them my problem and they were very helpful.  I had my near vision rechecked with my glasses on and low and behold was told the same thing you have been saying.  I received bifocals.  She gave me an add of +1.50 which in affect takes away the distance correction.  I am not real excited about the bifocal at 22 but am relieved that my vision is now clear.  I went with the lined and am getting used to them as we speak.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2008, 03:16</p><p>I wish I'd had this advice when I first got glasses. </p><p>I was about 21 and was prescribed just over -2. My distance vision had been getting worse but I hadn't had an eyetest for about 3 years. The optician was horrified and told me to go fulltime at once. </p><p>When I picked up my glasses I was amazed by the clarity of my distance vision: I could read the names over the shops opposite and pick out the features pf passers-by. But when I came to write a cheque to pay for the specs I couldn't focus on the chequebook. I mentioned it to the optician who seemed unconcerned. Things never really improved, probably because I never wore fulltime. </p><p>It was only when presbyopia set in and tests started to involve reading tiny close-up print wearing my distance rx that things improved. I got a 1.5 add and now have 2.25 (after nagging the optician) and can read well wearing glasses. </p><p>I wish I'd gone for bifocals right from the start. But, in the UK at least, it's not something that opticians seem to suggest. Things seem more enlightened in the US.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2008, 02:44</p><p>Jenny, I think bifocals or progressives may be convenient for your situation, but did you compare your acuity for close-up without glasses? I think it is advisable to have 2-3 pairs of glasses of different prescriptions. For me, I need +2.00 correction (In addition to -2.50 for distance) for reading (focusing within circa 70 cm).  </p><p> </p><p>I think your situation is quite normal, as the flexibility of ciliary muscles varies between individuals. Some may adapt well between close-up and distance, while some may find it difficult. (Though most would not encounter problem until they reach their 40s). I don't think you should forcibly adapt to the -1.50 for close-up, as this may prove adversely affecting your adaptation for distance. In fact, that process is exactly the same as inducing myopia to your eyes, and your myopia would probably progressing very fast that way.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Presbyope Challenged</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2008, 21:16</p><p>Cactus, The other glasses are single vision, so my concern is whether or not the progressive lenses will be satisfactory (I know you can only offer an opinion, albeit a very knowledgable one).  I suspect she may have needed a stronger add, but she is reluctant to wear glasses at all, although she does not mind the chic readers that she has.  Now, when she wears glasses instead of contacts, she is often having to pull the frames down for anything very close. I am hoping that the progressives will be more compatible and that she will wear more. I suspect a +2.00 add might hasten that process. Although that add seems a bit high for someone who is 45</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2008, 20:55</p><p>Presbyope Challenged, </p><p>I suspect sha may have really needed a stronger add than +1.00 or that her ciliary muscles have become deconditioned pretty quickly.  It can happen with surprising speed. </p><p>She will probably like the +2.00 bifocals, but may not like the progressives because the transition zone will likely be every narrow and the area of useful close vision will be small.  If she has both lined and progressives, she may opt to wear the lined bifocals around the house and the progressives in situations where she only needs to do a little reading. </p><p>You know your wife better than anyone else, is the fact that she is needing additional reading help oausing her any problems? It could be hard for her to deal with and she needs support from you. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2008, 20:34</p><p>Jenny, </p><p>It would not be unreasonable to go back to the eye doctor and tell her the problem.  She may suggest bifocals or waiting a little longer.  If she suggests bifocals you have two choices, lined or progressives.  You will be sorely temped to get progressives, but frankly lined bifocals are much better from an optical standpoint until you get into some very expenive lenses.  One solution would be to get some bifocals with an inexpensive frame for classroom use only and keep the single vision glasses for general wear. Treat them like "readers". </p><p>Remember, you are looking for and paid for is visual comfort and efficiency.  If you don't get it from these people, it is not unreasonable to ask for a refund and go elsewhere, but don't delay. </p><p>May I ask where you live? </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Presbyope Challenged</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2008, 19:36</p><p>Cactus, Quick question.  My wife has ordered two pairs of glasses.  The pair in which she wanted progressives, the optician said the lens was not tall enough  -  needed 26 ml.  So she switched to one that was slightly taller.  The reading add is +2.00, which seems to me to be a lot for someone who just got a +1.00 add about 4 months ago.  Do you think she will be able to tolerate the progressives with this add?  What was interesting as the optometrist was inserting plus lenses, there was some hemming and hawing and then he popped in the +2.00 and she said she could read everything</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jenny</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2008, 14:01</p><p>No they didn't.  It was my first time ever in an eye place so I guess I was clueless.  I also was really nervous and excited about looking across the room and it being all clear.  I didn't even think about trying to see things up close.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kelly</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2008, 13:56</p><p>Hi Jenny, I was checked for both distance and near at the eye dr's. When you got your glasses did the sales people not ask you if you could see better after they placed the glasses on your face? I had to read from a pre printed card and the chart on the wall. I also did this after I got the contacts, the only difference was that my eyes were watering like Niagara Falls. Or so it seemed.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jenny</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2008, 13:43</p><p>Kelly, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks.  It is good to know there are others kind of like me.  I don't have any astigmatism.  My doctor did say that I could take them off to read but while taking notes off the board that is really hard to do.  I don't think she ever tested my near vision with my prescription.  She tested my near vision before she had my lenses in the machine.  I really wish she had done that.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kelly</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2008, 13:12</p><p>Jenny, I also just recently was prescribed glasses.My prescription is  </p><p>-1.25 I was told by the eye dr. that it may be easier to remove the glasses for reading and computer work. I asked on here about contacts which I got a couple of weeks ago and obviously not being able to remove them and would it affect anything. To be honest my close vision with and without glasses/contacts I feel is about the same.  </p><p>Do you have the astigmatism in your glasses, and would that be a possible reason? Maybe Cactus Jack could answer that for you.   </p><p>My eyes were perfect as soon as the sales lady placed the glasses in front of my eyes. She also had me read close up and the chart on the wall in the shop. Did they do that for you? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>benn</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2008, 12:43</p><p>That's why I started with bifocals at age 19. My reading ability skyrocketed as I didn't get fatiged. I never looked back. That was 49 years ago when the only bifocal was lined or curved. </p><p> </p><p>The key is your eye sight.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jenny</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2008, 11:53</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for the quick response.  I have had my glasses for a little over two weeks.  How much more time should I give the eyes to adjust before going back in to see if there is a problem?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2008, 11:38</p><p>Jenny, </p><p>I believe what is happening is that your ciliary muscles and crystaline lenses are having to go to work to focus close.  Without your new glasses, your eyes are naturally focused at just about note taking distance. With your glasses, your eyes are focused for distance and the ciliary muscles and crystaline lenses are having to do what they were intended to do, which is add some plus power to focus closer. </p><p>It will take a few days or weeks for the muscles to get conditioned and used to providing the necessary focus power.  This is common is a situation like yours.   </p><p>In some instances, bifocals are prescribed as a temporary measure to help.  I don't remember the exact thread, but if you look back about 6 months for some posts by Carlos Jr., he discusses his son, Carlos IIIs, new glasses and how he had to get bifocals for a couple of months until his eyes got used to being corrected. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jenny</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2008, 11:13</p><p>I am a 22 year old college student who recently got my first pair of glasses.  They are for distance and my RX is around a -1.50.

<p><b>Presbyope Challenged</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2008, 00:56</p><p>Aubrac and Cactus Jack, Thanks for the advice. Actually after a bit the contacts were sharp, but there was strain.

I would prefer  minus lenses because I think they look better, although I think use of readers on the right person can be quite attractive. </p><p>My wife said yesterday that she thinks her eyes are getting worse as she wore her readers, so there is hope.

It is interesting that your could accommodate -3.75 contacts.  Are you sure you are not a little myopic? </p><p>As your wife get older, it is likely that she will soon need some stonger reading glasses if she continues to wear contacts and as the readers get stronger, she will need them more and more.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;29 Feb 2008, 20:01</p><p>George, </p><p>This is a little complex to explain so other members will understand what you want to do and my recomendation. Based on what you posted, your glasses Rx of: </p><p>OD -0.75  Add +1.25 </p><p>OS -0.50  Add +1.25 </p><p>Corrects your distance vision to 0.00 in both eyes and provides +1.25 of the approximate +2.50 necessary to focus at 16 inches or 40 cm reading distance. </p><p>Your Monovision contacts Rx of: </p><p>OD -0.50 </p><p>OS +0.75 </p><p>corrects you to effecively </p><p>OD +0.25 </p><p>OS +1.25 </p><p>and gives you the same effect as the reading add of +1.25 in your left eye, but does not provide full distance correction in your right eye, which is usually done for true monovision. </p><p>Your proposed full reading correction does not result in the same reading Rx in both eyes.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2008, 07:14</p><p>meep77, </p><p>Most astigmatism is caused by unevenness in the curvature of the cornea. The actual cause is unknown. Unlike myopia, it is not known to be progressive, but it can be slightly variable. </p><p>Some of the variance is caused by the fact that low astigmatism is hard to refract accurately because the final Rx depends on YOUR skill. During that part of the exam, You have to decide which lens is blurrier as the axis is being adjusted rather than which lens is clearer. It is hard to do without experience. I personally concentrate on letters like the "O" rather than letters with horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines like the "E" or "V" because it is easier for me to get it close. Then I ask the examiner if he will let me fine tune the axis at the appropriate time.  Most will place your hand on the correct knob and you can adjust it slightly at that point for the sharpest image. </p><p>Uncorrected astigmatism causes a lot of fatigue because it is impossible for the brain to focus the eye properly, no matter how hard it tries. </p><p>The point of all this is: Don't sweat it, just try to understand your role in that part of the exam to get the Rx as accurate as possible.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2008, 04:42</p><p>meep77, my cylinder has bounced around constantly as an adult and I have been a frequent wearer of both glasses (with cyl)and contacts (without cyl). In fact in one eye, my last exam was -.50 cyl, the previous was zero, and previous to that was -.25. I think it is more of a process of fine tuning. One thing for a myope with -.50 cyl, is that the doc often will "split the difference" in the contacts prescription and give an extra -.25 sphere to accomodate for no cylinder. </p><p></p><hr>

My prescription has always been for simple myopia, and stabilized around -3 for the past five years or so. But when I had my eyes tested yesterday, I was surprised that the doctor prescribed -.50 cylinder correction for astigmatism as well. </p><p> </p><p>Is this common to become astigmatic at my age? Is astigmatism progressive? Will wearing glasses with cylinder correction make the astigmatism more likely to get worse? Is it difficult to switch between classes that correct for astigmatism and contact lenses that don't?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2008, 05:11</p><p>Anja, I've been doing monovision for years with an RX close to yours. Why not consult your doctor? Typically, you're "dominant" eye (the one that you favor to use the most) will be used as you distance eye. The other one will be adjusted so that it is comfortable to read.  The doc can usually give you sample lenses to try for a week or so, then decide what really works best for your circumstances.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2008, 13:45</p><p>I don't know how you could put a number on the improvment, but I believe there is some.  There is a lot more to vision that just the optics of the eye.  Vision acutally occurs in the brain and it ideally has two images to use as a soucre to construct what we perceive as vision.  Some poeple are better than others at the task, but the more information the brain has to work with the better. </p><p>One thing for certain, if one image is better than the other, it will use the best image as the primary source and use data from the other image to improve the picture.  The best thing of course is to provide the brain with two sharply focused images. </p><p>C. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eyespy</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2008, 13:18</p><p>Cactus, do you know how much acuity is improved by seeing with two eyes? If someone is -3 maybe they are 20/200 when one eye is tested but with both eyes does that improve by a percentage?  So does seeing with both eyes make a 20/200 in one/each eye a 20/150 when using both? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2008, 21:02</p><p>If you have a strong plus lens, such as a jeweller's eyeglass, a crossed wire "sight" (as on a rifle, but can easily be made),an anglepoise lamp and a good metre rule to hand, you can construct an "optical bench" which will enable you to calculate the power of your lenses. The maths is too long and complicated to post here, but if you are interested, I can e-mail you the method. </p><p>This will only work if the plus lens is stronger than the minus lenses - which you can easily check by putting the two together and observing whether the effect of the combined lenses is plus or minus (magnification or minification). </p><p>Btw, this method is how I discovered a long time ago that spectacle lenses are always made in multiples of 0.25 dioptres!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2008, 16:27</p><p>Anja, </p><p>You already have "reading glasses" it is called low myopia. It is just not the same in both eyes. </p><p>You did't mention how much astigmatism you have and even low astigmatism can affect reading. Ideally, you should do monovision with the reading eye the one with the least astigmatism. As an easy test of your suitability and tolerance, you might try just wearing the -3 contact in your right eye only. That would be about the same as a +2.25 reading glass for the left eye. </p><p>It may take a day or two for your brain to learn to do monovision. Please give us a report on the results. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anja</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2008, 15:09</p><p>I am 46 with a prescription of -2.25 (L) and -3 (R), some astigmatism but not so much. Half of the time I wear glasses though socially I wear contacts. I suppose it is to do with my age but I find in low light conditions that it's hard to read. I have a friend who wears mono vision contact lenses, does anyone here have experience of them?

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2008, 08:07</p><p>Ruth, </p><p>Pretty much, but DO NOT order different reading adds unless you are absolutely certain of what you are doing and why. High plus lenses have a very narrow range of useful focus and you might find that you what was in focus for one eye was out of focus for the other and vice versa and you might wind up reading with one eye or the other. </p><p>The function of your distance Rx is to correct your overall refractive error to 0.00 in both eyes. Then, the add is applied equally to give you comfortable reading at various distances. </p><p>C.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2008, 17:49</p><p>Ruth, </p><p>Lots of good questions. I'll try to answer. </p><p>1. Sphere is one of the major elements of an optical Rx.  Cyklinder and axis (they go together) is another major element. </p><p>In this case sphere means that the lens is a section of a sphere or globe where the curvature is the same over the whole lens. Sphere generally corrects for refractive errors caused buy the length of your eyeball.  In your case, your eyeballs are a little bit too long for the plus power of your cornea and crystaline lens and light reays from distant objects focus just in front of your retina. The minus sphere in your glasses move the focus point back a little so it focuses on your retina. </p><p>Cylinder corrects for astigmatism.  It looks like a section of a can (like you find in your pantry) and the axis is the angular direction of the long axis of the can.  In the optical world, 0 degrees is horizontal and 90 degrees is vertical. By tradition, cylinder axis is from 0 to 179 degrees. </p><p>Cylinder and axis usually correct for unevenness in the curvature of the cornea. </p><p>2. Except for the fact that you have a cylinder correction for astimatism, YES. Glasses neutralized your refractive error and at low Rx, the optical poser of  </p><p>your eyes are actually the opposite Rx of your glasses. At highter Rx they will be different because of vertex distance, which the distance from your cornea to the back surface of the glasses. Low myopia without astigmatism means that you have natural (built in)reading glasses and you need "Distance Glasses". </p><p>3. YES. Except for the astigmatism (cylinder and axis) Prescription Single Vision Reading Glasses geve you a much larger field of view for comfortable reading than bifocals. Which is nice if you are doing a lot of reading or close work, the disadvantage is that distant things are very blurry with them, like you were more nearsighted than you are. </p><p>4. Opticians don't always prescribe the same add for both eyes, but it is rare because most people need the same amount of focusing help in both eyes. </p><p>Hope all this makes sense. It really is just straight forward optics.  See, you understand more optical physics than you thought you did. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2008, 20:32</p><p>guest, </p><p>It depends also on the width of the lens and the index of refraction of the lens material.  I think you are close.  Please let us know when you get them. </p><p>I'm wearing CR-39 15 BO in each eye with a low - Rx and the lenses are about 54 mm wide and 18 mm thick at the outer edge.  The inside edge is very thin, but with your -5.00 it may be a few mm thick. Hopefully, the lens maker will adjust the PD inward for the prism so your line of vision goes through the optical center of the lens.  If not, you may experience some   reduction of acuity. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2008, 19:19</p><p>I just ordered new glasses.  My prism prescription went from 5 BO in each lens, to 12 BO.  My old glasses are noticeably thicker on the outer edges.  I would estimate they are about 10mm on the outside edges.  The prescription is about -5.00 x -2.00.  If what I've read in this post is true (about 1mm edge thickness per prism diopter), then can I expect my new glasses to be 17mm thick?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2008, 08:08</p><p>Buck, </p><p>The amount of displacement of the optical center of the lens for prism is a function of the distance from the center of rotation of the eyeball (not the cornea) and the point where the axis of vision intercepts the rear surface of the glasses lens. You can calculate the actual displacement by using trig functions. </p><p>If the eye is not pointed straight ahead, moving the glasses away will change the point of intercept (trig again), but depending on the prism Rx, the change may not be very significant. The higher the amount of prism, the greater the displacement caused by increasing the distance from the center of rotation. </p><p>In some ways it is a bit like the effects of vertex distance on the effectiveness of a high sphere or cylinder Rx except, that effect is a square function and the OC displacement caused by prism is linear. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2008, 14:45</p><p>John, </p><p>If the Opthalmologist knows what he is doing, there should not be much danger or risk in getting rid of your secondary cataract.   </p><p>For those who are not familiar with secondary cataract, here goes: Modern cataract surgery involves emulsifying the clouded crystaline lens and sucking it out thru a very tiny incision in the side of the cornea. The rear membrane of the lens capsule is left intact to prevent mixing of the vitreous humor inside the eyeball and the aqueous humor between the cornea and the crystaline lens. </p><p>Then a replacement Intra Ocular Lens IOL is inserted thru the incision and positioned in the capsule. Tiny "feet" which protrude from the outer edge hold the lens in the center of the capsule.  In a few days, the intact rear membrane of the capsoule will attach itself to the IOL.  Over time, the eye may try to regrow the crystaline lens and the rear membrane of the capsule will become cloudy which is the "seconday" cataract. To eliminate this situation, a YAG laser is sharoply focused on the rear membrane and a number of pulses of the laser are used to vaporize small holes in the rear membrane until the central area behind the IOL is vaporized and no longer obstructs vision. Because the membrane is attached to the outer edges of the IOL, there is no mixing of the humors. </p><p>The procedure is used only if necessary and it is a once in a lifetime event for each eye. The procedure is painless, but the flashes are very bright and some machines make a "snapping" noise when they fire. The retina in this case is not burned by the YAG because of the tight focus in the plane of the rear membrane. By the time the laser beam gets to the plane of the retina, it is out of focus and so dispersed that there is not enough concentrated energy to damage the retina. In those instances where a YAG laser is used to re-attach the retina, the beam is focused on the plane of the retina and it so difused as it passes through the cornea and crystaline lens or IOL that it causes no damage there. </p><p>To better understand the focus method of the YAG laser, think of how a magnifiying glass burns a hole in paper when the sun's rays are concentrated and the cautions about looking at the sun or a laser beam without protection. Concentrated light energy from any source can damage the retina. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2008, 14:39</p><p>Buck, </p><p>Sorry to take so long to answer. </p><p>It is very difficult these days to find an Optician (Glasses Dispenser) who knows how to adjust the location of the optical center of a lens for prism. The problem is that common muscle surgery as almost eliminated the need for large prism corrections in glasses and few are trained on how to do it and few know where to find it in their reference books. The adjustment ranges between 0.25 and 0.3 mm per prism diopter depending on the amount of prism. The ideal situation would be for the central axis of vision of each eye should intercept the rear surface of the glasses lens at the optical center. </p><p>As you can see from the above, the small amount of base out prism you require would reduce the total PD by about 1 mm, though I am slightly suspicions of the 33/33.  With your low Rx that would almost be inconsequential except for the fact that you want progressives and your axis of vision needs to be close to the center of the channel for the least distortion. The more critical item is the vettical prism. My suggestion, would be to try to find another Optician who seems to understand how important getting it right is. Also, be sure that they will remake the glasses if you are not comfortable with them. </p><p>I am trying to remember the name of the primnary text on the making and fitting of glasses, I think the author is Swann or something like that. Perhaps another member can help out here. If you can locate the text, you might see if you can find the reference yourself and show it to the Optician, otherwise he will probably not believe you, after all he is the EXPERT, and you are merely the patient who has to wear the glasses. </p><p>On the effects of Vertex Distance on effective strength of lenses. In you increase the Vertex Distance of a minus lens, it becomes less effective which has the effect of reducing the - Rx.  A plus lens is just the opposite, increasing the Vertex Distance effectively increases the strength of the lens. It is hard to calculate for your Rx because of the low + sphere and the higher minus cylinder. This is a SWAG, but I would guess that at about 6" or 150 mm the effective Rx would be something like. </p><p>+1.25, -1.50 x 78 </p><p>+0.75, -1.50 x 84 </p><p>A more important factor is the distance from the glasses to the object being viewed. </p><p>We have an expression in our part of the world if information is considered very accurate, "You can take it to the Bank". I wouldn't! </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2008, 11:41</p><p>Astra -- I think one diopter approximates 100 in the denominator.  When my prescription was -12 (it's -13 now), my optometrist said my unaided vision was about 20/1,200.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2008, 15:00</p><p>Clare, </p><p>I've never been convinced that there is a linear mathematical relationship between an optical Rx and visual acuity as measured by lines on a Snellen Chart.  Right around the 20/20 line it seems a 0.25 diopter step in the plus direction will drop visual acuity to 20/25 or 20/30 and a 0.25 step in the minus direction will improve it to about 20/15, sometimes.  There are too many other factors that affect visual acuity than just sphere correction such as accuracy of the cylinder and axis correction, retinal contition, or what you did the night before.  The farther you get away from the 20/20 line toward the top of the chart, the more any mathematical relationship falls apart. You can identify the big E many clicks of the phropter before it is sharp and clear, which is why the final Rx is derived using little bitty letters near the bottom.  </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eyespy</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2007, 09:23</p><p>Came across this post randomly and it struck me how interesting people's thinking about their own vision is. Possibly needing a restriction on the license can only make this person maybe 20/60?? </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://wolfwyndd.livejournal.com/26076.html" target="_blank">http://wolfwyndd.livejournal.com/26076.html</a> </p><p>So I seem to have  misplaced my glasses at some point last weekend.  Marcy, Momma Lynne and I have torn the house apart looking for them and none of us can find them.  So I figured since it had been 18 - 24 months since I'd had my eyes checked I should probably make an appt. to get that done.  Lenscrafters is who did my eye exam last time and who I got my glasses from so I made an appointment over my lunch hour.  Well, I guess the REAL reason I figured I'd get my eyes checked again is when I pulled into the parking lot yesterday WITHOUT my glasses on, I lightly tagged the car in front of me.  Ooooooppps.  Ok, guess my eyes were worse then I thought.  So I went over at lunch, got my exam, picked out a pair of glasses and 312.00 later, I've got a totally new perscription.  According to the eye doctor my eyes have gotten at least one perscription strength worse in my right eye.  To the point that he said I'd probably have to have a resctriction on my license for glasses in the next two to three years.  That's the bad news.  The good news, according to him, is that most people in their 40's start to need reading glasses so when everyone else is putting glasses on to read menu's in restaurants, I'm taking my glasses OFF to read.  Oh, and just for some clarification, I'm near sighted.  VERY near sighted apparently.  You stick something in front of my face, I'm fine.  Hold something in front of my more then three feet and things start getting difficult to read.  Of course there's also that whole depth perception thing.  THAT'S where things get really iffy.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

It was something like-0.75 and -1.75 in the beginning and it wasn't till I got to somewhere around -2 and -3 that I found the interference from the -3 so irritating that I just decided it was more comfortable and sensible to wear them all day.That was about 10 years ago and I'm now about -2.50 and -3.50/-3.75.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Minnie</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2007, 13:44</p><p>Amsterdamer, </p><p>I have the situation of being +2.00 in my right eye and plano in my left.  I had never been prescribed glasses before, but finally got them this year and the change is incredible.  I am finally using both eyes!  I can actually feel my right eye working; when I remove the glasses, my right side becomes very blurry, I briefly see double, and I have the sensation that my eye is turning in.  My husband says that he doesn't see that happening, but that is the sensation that I get.  When I don't wear my glasses, I can see fine, but develop a headache rather quickly (so I guess I'm not seeing that fine, lol!).  I gather it makes a difference if one is myopic, but I thought I'd share from the one eye working harder perspective! </p><p>Good luck with the new glasses! </p><p>Minnie </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2007, 12:22</p><p>Amsterdamer - one of my colleagues was -1.75 and -2.75 and she was adamant that she couldn't go without her glasses.

Sometimes she would have go bare-eyed because she'd forgotten her contacts and would spend the whole day complaining that she had a headache. </p><p>Looking back, we were very unsympathetic, we just told her to get some spares and leave them in her desk!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amsterdamer</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2007, 11:23</p><p>Thank you again Cactus Jack. </p><p>Yes we have excellent transport here in The Netherlands and you know too that we like to ride our bikes! Good eyesight is advisable for that as well as driving. I think my brain is adapting to the new situation of seeing very well. I'll just see in the next months what happens and if my eyes start to tell me that they need glasses more than I now allow them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2007, 09:14</p><p>Amsterdamer, </p><p>What you are experiencing is absolutely normal for a person with your Rx. Vision actually occurs in the brain and your eyes are simply biological cameras that provide images to the brain. Cameras whose images are out of focus. </p><p>Human beings are supposed to see with both eyes and the brain uses the image from each eye to construct a 3 dimensional picture of the world about you.  The brain is extremely good at making the best of what it has to work with.  If the images from one eye is better than the other, it will use the better image and either ignore the other image or use elements from the poor image to add information to the good image.  It will not use information from the poor image to override the information from the good eye.  The brain does all this without any consious input from you. </p><p>If a very young child has better vision in one eye than in the other (a condition called amblyopia) the brain will often permanently stop using the image from the poor eye.  Even if the eye is optically corrected to 20/20 the brain will never use that eye again.  That is why it is so important to detect the condition early in young children (before about 5 or 6) and patch the good eye to force the brain to use the image from the bad eye. Fortunately, at your age, that is not generally a problem and if you correct the bad eye, the brain will soom learn to use it.  However, it may take a while for the brain to fully develop good depth perception.  Everyone is different. </p><p>After having said all that, the decision to wear vision correction, glasses or contacts, is yours. If you like seeing well, wear correction.  If you don't care or vanity is the overriding concern don't. You have apparently not had vision correction in the past, so your brain has much experience working with less than optimum input.  It now has to learn how to work with two good images and that takes time. </p><p>Because you apparently live in The Netherlands and have excellent public transportation, you may have no need to drive.  Whatever occupation you choose, you may not need good depth perception, so really good vision may not be all that important.   </p><p>My suggestion is to wear vision correction as much as possible so your brain will learn how to see really well (like the rest of us) and enjoy the beautiful fields of tulips in all their glory while you are young and your brain is agile. You can always not wear correction whenever you don't want to. In the final analysis, the choice is yours, no one elses. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amsterdamer</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2007, 12:51</p><p>Catus Jack, hi </p><p>This is the situation. In the last week and a half I have 'experimented' with these great new glasses and I have discovered that I can still see without them (better eye works harder), that they make the worst eye work immediately, and I can read with them and without them. I always thought people who wear glasses cannot see without them, you recommend glasses for comfort I read here tonight on Acuity &amp; Prescription. For anyone who can still see without them does this still make sense? I value your reply.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;09 Oct 2007, 14:46</p><p>Sorry about the typos in the previous post.  I think my fingers have a form of dyslexia - perhaps we could call it dystypeia. </p><p>I don't think I'm the only one with the affiction. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;09 Oct 2007, 14:42</p><p>Amsterdamer, </p><p>I am not an eye care professional, but I have had some personal expoerience with a situation similar to yours. Fourunately, my difference was discovered and corrected when I was 14 and I did not have too much trouble getting used to both eyes working together.  However, when I got to university and my reading load became great, I had to start wearing bifocals to keep from getting headaches.  </p><p>As I mentioned in my earlier post, your difference results in monovision where you use your -1.50 eye for distance (even though a little myopicly, it focuses at 66 cm) and you read with your -3.25 eye.  It is as if your -3.25 eye effectvely has a "built in" reading lens of +3.25 which focuses at about 30 cm. </p><p>I think I mentioned that your -3.25 eye will probably rebel at having to go to work, because now, the ciliary muscle and crystaline lens have to provide the additional plus power to focus close.  BTW, you can calculate the plus power required to focus close by dividing the distance in cm into 100.  For example to focus at a typical reading distance of 40 cm requires +2.50.  I suspect you are usesd to typically erading at about 30 cm because of the "built in" +3.25 in your right eye. </p><p>Your eyes were intended to work together rather than individually, but you are going to have to learn how and your ciliary muscles have to get conditioned.  It may take a few weeks to get comfortable.  However, if it causes too much discomfort, you may need to consider bi-focal glasses or a a poor, but probably comfortable Rx of: </p><p>OD Sphere -1.00, Cylinder -0.25 x 135 </p><p>OS Sphere -1.50 </p><p>You would still have monovision. but you right eye would not have to work quite so hard and you would begin conditioning your ciliary muscles. Later, the right Rx could be gradually increased until it was fully corrected. </p><p>I can understand the desire to avoid correction, but it really is not good to put it off because of the situation you are experiencing. </p><p>May I ask your age, occupation and gender? </p><p>C.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amsterdamer</b>&nbsp;09 Oct 2007, 13:26</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p>Hello. The new prescription has made a challenge for my -3 eye. I have worn them Sunday til today. When I put them on and take them off the vision in the -3 will change dramatically. I'd say it is like it jumps. After a moment or two it's okay. Obviously my vision is very good, I can see the small writing on the television now. </p><p>Without glasses it feels like the -3 eye is working hard and the other one does nothing, although I can see quite well with it so without glasses I don't feel (yet) so blind.  </p><p>My colleague says it will come that I must wear these all the time because the difference is so big.

<p><b>Amsterdamer</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2007, 14:07</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p>Again, thanks. I collected the glasses this afternoon - the optical shop gave no advice at all.  Your comments about the muscles are a concern. I'll test the new glasses out tomorrow.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2007, 13:06</p><p>Amsterdamer, </p><p>Thanks, I was a little concerned about the increase in your right eye, but -1.25 in 5 years is not unreasonable.   </p><p>Without correction, you effectively have monovision where you read with your right eye and use the left eye for distance (even though the left eye isn't 20/20). I urge you to wear your glasses of if you have a problem with that, get contacts.  It is important that both eyes are working together like they are supposed to, even though it may intitally be uncomfortable. The problem with monovision at your age is that your ciliary muscles and crystaline lenses are not being used and are probably out of contition.   This could ultimately lead to early symptoms of  presbyopia and a requirement for multifocals before you ordinarily would. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amsterdamer</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2007, 11:19</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p>It is a long time since my last test perhaps as much as 5 years but I'm 28. </p><p>Yes the 'OD' eye is bad but the other is not so bad. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2007, 08:53</p><p>Amsterdamer, </p><p>I would suggest full time wear.  There is enough difference to cause your eyes to not work together in a coordinated way.  The brain will always select the clearest image as the primary and use the other image to try to add information, if possible, and ignore the rest. In this instance, there is a small difference in image size with glasses, but probably not enough to cause problems. </p><p>May I ask your age and how long ago your old Rx was prescribed. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2007, 08:10</p><p>Amsterdamer, </p><p>It sounds like a very large difference, however the terms 20/70 and 20/300 do not describe the actual refractive error which is very important. </p><p>It is likely that the individual has monovision without correction where the brain ignores the extremely blurry image from either the 20/300 eye or the 20/70 eye depending on the optical situation and if they are trying to see something close or distant. </p><p>They probably need full time correction, but even with that, they may not have stereoscopic vision because of the possible difference in image size and method of correction (contacts or glasses). </p><p>Could you provide a prescription? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amsterdamer</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2007, 07:27</p><p>Hi </p><p>I read here recently that most people have a difference between their two eyes. Is 20/70 and 20/300 a big difference? </p><p>How much would someone with this wear  glasses? </p><p>Thanks </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2007, 17:34</p><p>No, I never did find there was a problem with double vision. Although, at that time I was still young enough that I had lots of accommodation.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2007, 16:25</p><p>Plus and Minus, </p><p>One thing I forgot to mention. You may be able to tell if you are surpressing one eye or actually fusing the images with the following test. </p><p>When the images appear to be fused, move your hand back and forth alternately covering one eye and then the other for about 1/2 second each eye. If the image jumps very much you may be surpressing the image from one eye. If it doesn't appear to jump much, you are probably fusing the images and using both eyes together as you should. There may be a very tiny jump because of the still differing image size. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2007, 15:03</p><p>Plus and Minus, </p><p>I believe the very best situation would be for the images to be exactly the same size on the retina. Which I believe would be accomplished by what ever sphere value contact lens provides the same sphere value in both lenses in the glasses. Remember, however that your brain has no experience with that situation. I suspect that your brain has been using one eye or the other, but rarely both at the same time. </p><p>Isn't it interesting that with considerable effort you were able to fuse the images? It is likely that it has been many years (or maybe never) since you brain could even attempt it. What that means is that your brain CAN learn how to do it. Each time it will get easier. See, old dogs can learn new tricks! Learning may not as easy when we get older as it was when we were young, but we can still learn. But, what is the point. If the solution is to wear a contact and glasses, you might as well get the very best possible solution. That solution is the one that provides comfortable 2-eyed vision for all purposes. </p><p>BTW, for small amounts of prism, if that is what is needed, all they do is move the location of the optical center (adjust the PD) of the lenses in the frame, which is no big deal. </p><p>I am excited about your progress. I don't understand why the OD didn't match the sphere values in the glasses to start with. Maybe he didn't have the right value + lens in stock, which isn't much excuse. He may not be too accustomed to creative solutions to unusual vision problems. I understand that problem. Been there, done that. </p><p>C. </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus and Minus</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2007, 12:34</p><p>Visitor, Specs4ever, and Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for the comments. </p><p> </p><p>Visitor, as for possibly having to wear prism forever, that is ok with me if it is a good solution especially for reading. I am getting up in years and reading, which is my priority, has gotten terribly uncomfortable and slow. In factg it would be ok to wear glasses all the time. The contact was to even up the eyes. </p><p> </p><p>Specs4ever, you at one time had a somewhat similar difference. Did you yourself experience prism glasses over the contact? </p><p> </p><p>Cactus Jack, I tried by concentrating to make the double image go away. After a tremendous effort while focusing on one word, it did. I don't know if it went away because of convergence or suppression. But it seems unlikely that my brain would ever be able to adjust if it takes that much effort. After this experiment my right eye felt so stressed that I was afraid it would be dangerous to try the experiment again. However, when I blink, for a very time moment the double image is not present. </p><p> </p><p>In your post where it says "... a different CL value that more closely matches the sphere value of each lens in the glasses will do it.  </p><p> ..." The near points when wearing the reading glasses over the contact seem to be about the same but the doctor put +2.50 in the left lens while only 1.50 in the right so the glasses lenses aren't as close as they could be. Are you saying that may be part of the problem? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2007, 06:28</p><p>Visitor, </p><p>Prism is useful for many purposes. In this case the amount of prism is likely to be very small. </p><p>The description of the problem was that "bed" looked like "bedd". That amount of displacement was about one letter width of (I assume) typical bookface type (about 2 mm)at a reading distance of 16 inches or 40 cm.  </p><p>The definition of a prism diopter is that amount of prism which displaces a ray of light 1 cm (10 mm) at a distance of 1 meter (100 cm). If we do a little ciphering, one letter width would be about 2 mm at 40 cm would be the same as 5 mm at 100 cm or about 0.5 prism diopter of correction. </p><p>That amount of displacement is very small and would normally be easily resolved by the brain's slightly adjusting the convergence of the eyes. However, I suspect that because of years of dealing with or NOT dealing with impossible image fusion problems, Plus and Minus's brain doesn't have much experience "fine tuning" eye convergence. If he can get the image size problem under control, it is likely that in time, his brain will get more skilled at image fusion. If a little prism doesn't do the trick, I suspect that a different CL value that more closely matches the sphere value of each lens in the glasses will do it. </p><p>There seems to be an almost religious aversion to using prism, but in reality, it is just another tool. Prism, in this case, may help with eye postiioning and position control problems in ways that are similar to the ways that sphere and cylinder lenses help with refraction problems. Unfortunately, humans tend to get rather dependent on tools of all sorts to help them solve problems. It is surely a weakness.   </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2007, 05:31</p><p>In this case the contact lens is used to reduce the difference in prescription between eyes.  Over the years I have seen a number of people with large differences in their script, such as a young 16 year old girl at Seal Beach Pier one Sunday who had about -16 in one eye and -8 in the other.  However, I am sure that she would have just ended up wearing contact lenses, rather than a lens in both eyes. At one time I had about -3.75D between both eyes, and I did wear a contact lens, but only in one eye.  </p><p>So, done this way, prisms will work because they will be in the glasses. And you are correct about becoming dependant on prisms, but if they are needed to bring the vision to a proper point, then I agree with Cactus Jack that they should be tried. However this is not a person who is prescribing their own problems, but is actually trying to get a handle on what he should ask his doctor.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Visitor</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2007, 03:39</p><p>Prism may well help you to focus on a single image, but if you start relying on prism correction you can say goodbye to contact lenses.Prisms are not easy to put into lenses and you will soon find that you need the prism correction all the time to focus on a single image.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus and Minus</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2007, 10:52</p><p>Thanks for the info about prism. </p><p> </p><p>There is no double image individually. </p><p> </p><p>Hope to see the optometrist this week. I'll have an idea what to expect.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2007, 10:10</p><p>Plus and Minus, </p><p>Glad I was able to help some. Sounds like you are making progress in solving the problem. Don't give up. </p><p>Here is a quick test to see if you really are having trouble with fusing the two imges or if you are experiencing monocular dioplia (two images with one eye. </p><p>If you are experiencing the dioplia (e.g. "bed" appears as "bedd"). Try covering each eye individually with your hand. If the individual images are OK, a little bit of prism may help or a closer match of glasses Rx may solve the problem. </p><p>Lenses with prism are just thicker at one edge than at the other. The thicker edge is called the "Base". The location of the base depends on what is needed. It is prescribed as Base Out (BO), Base In (BI), Base Up (BU) or Base Down (BD). Prism is more moticable in minus lenses than plus lenses because of increase of edge thickness which is about 1 mm per diopter at the base edge (the edge opposite the base gets thinner).  Actual thickness depends on lens size and index of refraction. Small amounts of prism are almost undetectable in plus lenses just by looking. </p><p>Your reading Rx with Base out prism might look like: </p><p>Left: +2.50 -1.50 X33 Prism 2 BO  </p><p>Right: +1.50 -.50 X95 Prism 2 BO </p><p>If a little prism would help your reading, a quick test with a trial prism lens or a "prism bar" while you are wearing your reading glasses and contact should answer the question. </p><p>A Prism Bar is a plastic bar with a series of prisms of different values cut into it. It allows a quick trial of many different amounts of prism by just moving the bar up and down. </p><p>Small amounts of prism do not generally affect acuity. Large prism corrections can cause optical distortion in the glasses and resulting acuity problems if not prescribed and fitted correctly. </p><p>Large prism corrections are rarely needed today because corrective muscle surgery is relatively easy and usually successful. Prescribing and fitting large prism corrections may be a lost art. </p><p>C.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus and Minus</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2007, 08:50</p><p> </p><p>Problem: Horizontal diplopia </p><p> </p><p>Here is a progress report - with more questions ! - pertaining to my situation which I posted on this thread on July 3. </p><p> </p><p>Basically there is a 4.75 diopter sphere difference between the refractions of my eyes. Reading glasses were not satisfactory due to the difference between the lenses of the glasses. The plan was to wear one contact plus glasses to get the lenses more similar. Cactus Jack suggested a simple soft contact with CYL in the glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Wearing now for reading: </p><p>Contact, Left: D +4.00 ACUVUE </p><p>Glasses </p><p>Left:  +2.50 -1.50 X33   </p><p>Right:  +1.50 -.50 X95 </p><p> </p><p>The contact is very comfortable. But to my surprise there is a horizontal double image. For example, looking at "bed" I see "bedd". At intermediate even without the glasses there is a double image. At distance it is hard to tell. </p><p> </p><p>Any comments about why this is and what solutions there might be will be appreciated. Is "prism" the solution and if so the only solution - I am not familiar with it but have started to look into it. What would a typical prism prescription look like?

<p><b>Plus and Minus</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2007, 13:06</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>It has been a long time since I last had contacts. I tried 3 technologies at different times with 3 different people: plain RGP, Soft(toric?), and toric RGP. For RGP and toric RGP they both did plain RGP first; the left lens would not stay centered; then they both increased diameter; left still wouldn't center. One guy gave up. When the other guy finally went to toric RGP the left was centered fairly well - as I recall.  </p><p> </p><p>The soft were my least favorite. The vision in the left eye was never good. They were hard to put in and a lot of money was spent on pure water.  Of course, that was what now would be 15-year-old technology. </p><p> </p><p>That's why I've been thinking of getting Toric RGP to begin with. </p><p> </p><p>When you say torics are hard to keep in place is that soft or RGP? Do you happen to know what the maximum plus correction is for RGP and soft nowadays? I agree the astig correction could be put in the glasses. And putting a bit more plus for example 4.75 could be handled at distance with -1.00 in each lens. From playing with these reading lenses I actually think I could use a little more plus in left eye for reading assuming I get a contact. </p><p> </p><p>In previous attempts I wore contacts on both eyes. Having only one contact may improve the odds of success because when a person has different shaped eyes with contact lenses of different shapes and weights, the contacts are never in synch in the way they move so the person rarely sees through the center of both lenses at the same time. At least that's my theory. </p><p> </p><p>Age: 64.  San Antonio, USA. Why? Do you know a super contacts person around here? And, by the way, are you involved in some vision field? I see a lot of posts. </p><p> </p><p>It was the first visit to this optometrist. After the research I'll run it by him. He apparently thought I should keep doing what I've been doing which is very unsatisfactory and gets more so with the years. He was on a tight schedule and no doubt not expecting someone with wierd vision. That doesn't let him off the hook entirely but I will give him another chance. </p><p> </p><p>If you are from the USA, happy Fourth. If not, the best to you anyway.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speculate</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2007, 07:31</p><p>i have wondered if someone would care to have a stab in the dark as to what the prescription may progress to for someone who was non cyclopleged at the age of 39 revealing 1 and 1.25D of hyperopia,with only eyestrain as a symptom currently.Is it possible that there is a fair bit of latency to come out or will this likely be the first and final script?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2007, 12:16</p><p>Plus and Minus, </p><p>The 4.75 D difference is probably causing most of your problems because of the different image sizes on the retina. The Astigmatism, while important, in probably not causing much problem if it is corrected. </p><p>A +3.75 soft contact to correct the sphere in the left eye would probably be useful.  It would even be worth considering a bit more in the left eye to make the image size equal.  You could then correct both with low minus glasses with some cylinder for the astigmatism.  Toric contacts are hard to keep in place at low cylinders. </p><p>May I ask your age and where you live? </p><p>Also, you might consider seeing another Eye Care Professional. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

It seems, without discussing this with the Dr yet, that it would be a big improvement if the left eye could be lasered, molded or corrected by contact lens; then reading glasses could be used with the same correction for each eye. </p><p> </p><p>One image is larger than the other which causes difficulty when looking from point A on, say, the left to point B on the right. The eyes have to move in a very unnatural way. There is double vision for a moment on the left end of each line. On the right end it feels like the eyes are trying to cross. </p><p> </p><p>The glasses really cannot be used for reading. But they are good when staring at a single word. The doctor wasn't inclined to give me a reading prescription but I wanted to be able to experiment. </p><p> </p><p>If that left eye correction, +3.75 -1.50 X 35, could be eliminated, reading glasses of +1.50 could be used for each eye.  </p><p> </p><p>According to internet searches the limit for molding is +3.00 so that won't work. Don't know yet the maximum correctable by laser or contact. Does anyone know if that much farsightedness and astigmatism can be corrected by laser? And can a rigid toric lens correct that amount of error? Or any other ideas for making reading more comfortable?</p><p></p><hr>

Best spectacle corrected and uncorrected visual acuity tests are performed separately for each eye (one eye at a time). Presenting visual acuity is measured with the participant's habitual distance correction. Lensometry is performed by an optometrist for those who use glasses. Visual acuity is recorded as the smallest line in which the patient can read the four letters correctly. If the person is unable to read the largest E letters in the chart (20/400 E letters) at 4 meters, then finger counting is done at 1 meter. The examiner stands one meter in front of the participant and asks if the participant can see his/her hand." </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for your help everyone.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;10 May 2007, 17:09</p><p>John, </p><p>Possibly. It might be better to make sure exactly what is happening, there are many different causes.  In some situations prism can help by reducing the work the positioning muscles have to do, but they are not always a perfect solution.  Prism can introduce undesired optical effects such as color fringing and adjusting the Pupiliary Distance of the glasses so the line of vision and the optical center of the lens is coincident is also important for the best vision.  An Eye Care Professional with experience and knowledge of muscle problems can usually help.  Even though she is an adult, a Pediatric Opthalmologist who also treats Adult Strabismus (muscle imbalance) would be a good ECP to consult. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

She has moderate hyperopia which is also called long or farsightedness.   </p><p>A low hyoerope may be able to see very distant objects clearly, but their focusing muscles in the eye must work very hard to do it.  Sort of like a person with normal vision trying hard to read somthing just 2 or 3 inches in front of their eyes.  A moderate hyperope, like your girlfriend, probably cannot make distant objects focus at all, without wearing plus lenses, in her case +5.50. </p><p>-continued-</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;10 May 2007, 15:13</p><p>John, </p><p>Part 2 of 3 </p><p>It is not unusual for some hyperopes to have problems with their eyes trying to cross.  This is caused by a coupling mechanism in almost everyoneï¿½s brain that causes your eyes to  turn inward (converge) when you focus on something close.  This is so you donï¿½t see double when you try to read.  Because a hyperope eye muscles have to work extra hard all the time, sometimes the convergence mechanism gets rather powerful and the inside eye positioning muscles want to pull inward when they shouldnï¿½t.  The outside muscles can sometimes fight the inside muscles, but like all muscles, they will get tired after a while and the eyes turn inward.  It is called Fatigue Esophoria. </p><p>-continued-</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;10 May 2007, 15:12</p><p>John </p><p>Part 3 of 3 </p><p>One way to minimize the inward turning tendency is to try to keep the focusing muscles relaxed so they donï¿½t trigger the convergence effect.  That is done with bifocals, so the focus muscle doesnï¿½t have to work to focus to read.  In your GFï¿½s situation, the +3.00 add does that. </p><p>If your GF is having some problems as you describe, it could mean that she needs a bit more + for distance. Or, perhaps she could benefit from tri-focals, so she doesnï¿½t have to work to focus at intermediate distances. </p><p>Her eye doctor knows what to do.  I would suggest that she schedule an appointment and tell him what is happening. </p><p>I hope this is helpful. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

I have a strong scientific background, and am fascinated with all things optical - lenses, glasses, microscopes, telescopes, prisms, holograms, etc.  My point is that it seemed inappropriate for someone to ask a group of people that he does not even know on the Internet what an eyecare professional should be doing about his girlfriend's eye turning in.  I am well aware that there is huge amount of expertise in this group; I consider myself part of that group.  But last I checked, none of us are practicing optometrists, opthomologists, or even opticians.

<p><b>Connie</b>&nbsp;09 May 2007, 16:42</p><p>Just back from the optical shop this afternoon. When I told them that I had blurry vision with the Freshlook one day 0.00 contacts they sold to me they did a measurement on my eyes through a machine which found that I was not nearsighted at all but had flat corneas. Thus I do not need glasses. I put on a pair of the contacts and they remeasured me in the machine which found that I need -.75 power in the contacts. They showed the results to their doctor who said that I could exchange the 0.00 lenses for -.75 power if I want to continue to use the contacts. Because of the way the lenses fit on my corneas there is induced nearsightedness when I wear these lenses. They had to order the -.75 lenses for me. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Connie</b>&nbsp;07 May 2007, 15:24</p><p>Thanks for everyone's help. My roomate let me use her old glasses which are too mild for her. She said that the right lens was -.75 and the left -1.25.

I then put on a pair of the 0.00 colored lenses and my long distance vision beyond 4 to 5 feet was fuzzy. However with her old glasses on top of these contacts the distance vision cleared up.

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;05 May 2007, 20:34</p><p>Hi Connie, </p><p>I have a theory as to why you see better with the minus 1 lens.  Lenses absorb most of the light but reflect some.  Therefore, the image you see through a lens isn't a bright as without.  If things are not as bright, your iris opens wider to let more light in, which reduces your depth of field and blurs your vision. </p><p>If you see better through a -1 lens, why not get a pair of them for yourself? It's a very weak lens and couldn't hurt your eyes. </p><p>Good luck.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hansel</b>&nbsp;05 May 2007, 15:37</p><p>Is it possible that having "seen great" wearing the -1.00 lenses, suddenly you are surprised that you don't see as well with the planos.  </p><p>I appreciate that you say that without them everything is great, but could it be that actually what you have really noticed is that -1.00 makes a difference to you? </p><p>Just a thought.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;05 May 2007, 14:49</p><p>Connie, </p><p>What you described would cccur if the lenses supposedly without a prescription, in fact had a plus prescription.  Check the box carefully is the prescription maked Plano or 0.00 in addtion to Diameter and Base Curve? </p><p>You can estimate the amount of plus (assuming you in fact you have 20/20 vision) by dividing the distance from your eyes to the most distant object you can see clearly into 1 meter or 3.28 feet depending on your prefered units of mesure.  For example, if things become blurry at about 1 meter or about 3 feet. 1/1 = +1.00 diopter or 3.28/3 = 1.09 or + 1 diopter. </p><p>Let me know if you need help estimating the power of the lenses. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Connie</b>&nbsp;05 May 2007, 11:28</p><p>I am confused. I have never been prescribed glasses but recently tried some colored contacts. My roomate who has worn contacts and glasses for years recently got some FreshLook one day colored contacts. Her right eye was -1.00 and the left was -2.50. The gray color looked great on her eyes. She gave me a pair of her right lenses -1.00's to try and I loved the color as well. I could also see with these lenses. I wore them out one night and had no trouble with them. I went to the optical shop to buy some of my own and got the same type of lens with no prescription. However, the next time I wore them out at night everything seemed blurry in the distance. Without the lenses I see just fine. I tried another pair of my roomates lenses -1.00's and saw great with them. Yet I don't need glasses and see well when not wearing lenses. </p><p>What is wrong with the plain colored contact lenses? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Marthe</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2007, 14:13</p><p>Hi </p><p>No that's definately not the reason. I could comfortably wear them all day except that I would take them off as habit. So nosepads is nothing to do with my issue!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2007, 13:55</p><p>I have a theory for this. Maybe they aren't the best fitting, i.e. for me most of the time the nosepads are too big. Actually I probably notice more about different types of nosepads than anyone else, but anyway.. my first pair even though reading and computer work gave me eyestrain I put up with it even with glasses because essentially they were uncomfortable. It took I think my 3rd pair (which was the same as my second one) with different nosepads for me to go full time as they were really comfortable and fit well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Marthe</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2007, 13:43</p><p>Hi Iï¿½m fascinated by when and how much people wear their glasses. Iï¿½m at a stage when I wonder if Iï¿½m unusual in not wearing mine more, judging by friends and wonder why is it that I am happy to wander around at home with slightly fuzzy things when friends of mine with similar prescriptions canï¿½t do without their glasses? My prescription is -2 and -3, I canï¿½t watch TV comfortably without them ï¿½ I can see thereï¿½s something there, but couldnï¿½t read any text ï¿½ I need them for driving too.  I could happily wear them more, my glasses look great, so am I strange to put up with things inside the house that are slightly out of focus or is it usual for someone with my prescription. Iï¿½m not blind without them (obviously) and Iï¿½ve been told that my better eye compensates for the worse, but am I being stupid not to get the best possible vision all the time? My guess is itï¿½s a subjective thing but Iï¿½d like to know what others here think too. Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2007, 15:07</p><p>Lentifan, </p><p>I have had cataract surgery with my natural lenses removed and replaced with artifical lenses.  Prior to the procedure, they used an untrasound device to measure the length of my eyeballs, and the thickness of my corneas and crystaline lenses. Using this information they calculated the power of the new lens required to to get me close to 20/20 or whatever I wanted. I chose monovision with a target of 0.00 in one eye and -1.50 in the other. The idea being that if I go up at night, I could function fairly well without bothering to find my glasses. </p><p>Because the new lenses are available in 0.50 D increments and they have no effect on astigmatism which is in the cornea, I wound up with +0.25 in one eye and -1.25 in the other with a little astigmatism. </p><p>With glasses, I have almost 20/15 acuity, with normal visual fields. I am slightly sensitive to bright sunshine because the artificial lenses are actually 6% more efficient in light transmission than natural lenses. They also block most UV whcih doesn't hurt anything. </p><p>The only downside is that I need trifocals, but I needed them before the surgery so no big deal. </p><p>Hope this was helpful information. </p><p>I have been thinking of writing up the whole thing as a true adventure, I don't know if Bobby would be interested or not. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2007, 13:03</p><p>I have a question.  If the natural lens is removed from an eye (lensectomy) and replaced with a spectacle lens of the correct power, is there any loss of visual acuity? </p><p>I can understand that there will be a loss of the field of vision, due to the magnification effect of the plus lens and distortion away from the centre of the lens, but my question relates to the visual acuity at the centre of the lens. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>OttO</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2006, 19:59</p><p>Wayne - Thanks for some interesting observations.  I can certainly relate to your experience.  I did get weaker lenses shortly after my eye exam in early 2005 (at age 56). I was not seeing very well with my distance lenses and was tilting my head back to see middle distances with my bifocal reading lenses. Pain in the neck! </p><p>I went L from -4.75 to -3.00 (I might have been a little overcorrected) and R from -3.50 to -3.00.  And it was 8 years since my previous exam! It will be interesting to see if my RX decreases any in the future.  </p><p> </p><p>Although I'm a myope I did get the tripple whammy - trifocals. To top it off I've now got correction for astigmatism (which I didn't have previously) so it's now more comfortable reading with my glasses than without.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2006, 18:59</p><p>I believe that it's very common for myopia to decrease as presbyopia sets in.  Over the last 12 or 13 years my distance Rx has decreased from a high of L-7, R-6.50  to L-5, R-4. </p><p> </p><p>In a similar manner, someone who has been emetropic and never previously needed correction may find that at a certain age they need not only reading glasses but some correction for distance as well. </p><p> </p><p>A hyperopic person can get a triple whammy.  Not only bifocals for reading but also a stronger distance Rx and a greater dependence on glasses because they can no long accomodate for distance as they could when younger.   </p><p> </p><p>It sort of evens things out.  When younger many hyperopes can function quite well for distance in many situations where even a low to moderate myope would might difficulty.  When older, however, the hyperope becomes more dependent on glasses while a myope has improved distance vision and the ability to read bare-eyed without glasses. Of course, anyone with a very high Rx + or - would always be dependent on correction.  </p><p> </p><p>Otto, I would recommend getting the weaker lenses as long as they give you 20/20 vision.  You are, in effect, somewhat hyperopic while wearing your current glasses.  This puts strain on your eyes to accomodate for the excess minus and could lead to headaches before long.  Also, as the presbyopia increases, you will eventually find that distance is not clear with the too strong prescription. </p><p> </p><p>I first realized that my myopia had decreased when I found that I could see distance better by tilting my head to look through the intermediate part of my progressive lenses.  I still need glasses full time to function adequately for distance but find I can now read at a comfortable distance without glasses.  I'm still sometimes surprised to find I can see things without having to get as close as I once did.  I'm 64 by the way.  Nearsightedness set in when I was 10 and presbyopia in my mid-40's.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2006, 10:10</p><p>I wonder if the reduction in myopia could be caused by relaxation of the crystaline lens and ciliary muscles Perhaps caused by fatigue.  There is such a thing as pseudo myopia "induced" or otherwise. </p><p>Myopia is generally thought to be caused by excessive eyeball length for the optical power of the cornea, crystaline lens, and there is also and element of refractive power of the fluids in the eyeball. The refractive index of the Vitreous Humor and other eye fluids can change as glucose content changes. Diabetics with uncontrolled blood glucose experience problems with 1 to 2 Diopter Rx changes over relatively short periods of time and some even have several pairs of glasses with different Rx. </p><p>If you are experiencing sudden changes in Rx, a quick, easy, and almost painless blood glucose check would be worthwhile.   </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rio</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2006, 08:33</p><p>I had a similar experience and went from -4 to -3 almost overnight.

Same thing happened to one of my colleagues who went from -3 to -2 and is nearly free of her glasses and very pleased.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>OttO</b>&nbsp;07 Oct 2006, 22:16</p><p>Merrill.  You don't tell us your age, but you say you can see just fine with your too strong lenses.  You must have quite a bit of accomodation yet.  If it were me I would just keep the lenses and go on my merry way with them. Enjoy them and save yourself some money! As far as we know it's not going to do you any harm. (I'm no expert.  It's just what I've read and learned from EyeScene et al.)  As for me, I'm past  50 and my accomodation is going.  The lack of ability to see through my now too strong lenses is what finally got me to go for an exam. With weaker lenses I'm able to focus normally again. The result of advancing presbyopia is that I've advanced from bifocals to trifocals.  The only real change I've noticed is that without glasses I can see a bit further without poking my nose into what I'm trying to see. My RX may have gone down some, but I do like the trifocals. </p><p>Enjoy the stronger lenses while you can.  The time will come when you can't.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Merrill</b>&nbsp;07 Oct 2006, 14:48</p><p>OttO </p><p>Wow that sort of problem didn't come up. In fact it was positioned as something I should really be pleased by. Funny thing is that I still seem to be able to see fine through my now too strong lenses. Because of that there doesn't seem to be any rush to pick out new frames. Should I go ahead and get the weaker lenses as I see just as fine as I ever did? </p><p> </p><p>Your prescription is stronger than mine but did you notice any benefit from the reduction?  Should I be prepared to be able to go without glasses sometimes or isn't the reduction that signficant?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>OttO</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2006, 19:38</p><p>Merrill </p><p>The same thing happened to me last year. Decrease in myopia, that is. Of course I went some 8 years between exams and had a significant increase in both presbyopia and astigmatism.  I went from R -3.5 to -3.0 and L from -4.75 to -3.0 (It's possible my left eye could have been a bit over corrected.)  Any way, the opthalmologist says that for the myopia to decrease is not all uncommon.  More recently I have read that decreasing myopia may be related to onset of type 2 diabetes (growth of veins in the eyes).  I'm not sure of the veracity of this.  However it may be a warning sign!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Merrill</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2006, 13:22</p><p>Hi there. I wanted to post that my prescription has dropped somewhat and I wondered if that was considered unusual. I have gone from -3.25 and -3 to -3 and -2.25. It seems like a huge drop to me. At least -2.25 seems very low from what I'm used to. I'm not sure how much that even means I'll need glases, although I realise I still have one eye that's pretty bad. I'd really like to hear if anyone else here has had a similar experience. Thanks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2006, 17:21</p><p>I don't think so. I have worn both larger dia. soft lenses and smaller dia. soft lenses that were the same size as corneas. But the larger dia. lens is much more comfortable to wear and stays in place better.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2006, 16:00</p><p>I have a question. I usually post only on the "Guys with Glasses" thread, but this is a little more general so I will ask here:  Are soft contact lenses with high minus prescriptions usually smaller in diameter than lower minus contacts?  I have this idea in my mind, and I'm not sure where it came from. When I see contacts in a guy's eyes, I'm always looking for clues to their prescription. Sometimes the edge of the lens goes way beyond the iris, and sometimes it is only a little bigger.  Does anyone know?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2006, 21:59</p><p>Thank you Matthew. Your post is most informative. Also today it is harder to spot a bifocal wearer because most wear in (plus or minus Rx) progressive lenses. The only exception is in mild plus Rx's when viewed from behind, the mild progressive lens has a "funhouse mirror" affect.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>matthew</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2006, 23:28</p><p>continued...I've known a few girls who were farsighted.  It seems like (in my circle of friends and acquaintances, which - again - is about 75% myopic) myopes outnumber them by maybe 10 to 1 or so.  So out of every 40 people, 30 would be myopic, maybe 3 would be hyperopic, 6 would have "normal" (hee hee...doesn't sound very normal to me) vision, maybe 1 would have something else - astigmatism without significant myopia or hyperopia, or another less common eye disorder.   </p><p> </p><p>I wonder, though, if there aren't a lot more latent hyperopes out there than I realize.  My 'real' prescription is about -3, but for the past couple years I've normally worn -8 glasses.  And while I sometimes find it difficult to focus at first, I have rarely experienced any eyestrain-related discomfort.  After a few minutes, they feel comfortable and normal and my vision is fine.  So as far as my eyes' lenses go, this is a lot like being a +4 hyperope.  And the hyperopic people I've seen have been +4 or less, not more than that.  So I wonder if there aren't a lot of hyperopes who are fairly young with a significant 'real' prescription but who never use correction.  So those who do use correction are those who find it relatively difficult to deal with the constant accommodation.  This would be consistent with something else I've noticed among reports on this site from "latent hyperopes": it's common for them to move to bifocals fairly soon after starting to wear glasses.  That would make sense, since I'm suggesting that most young hyperopes who use correction are those who have relatively poor accommodation (compared to the majority).   </p><p> </p><p>Obviously, a lot of this is spec-ulative and it's almost all anecdotal.  So it can't really be taken too seriously. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>matthew</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2006, 23:28</p><p>Tod...you asked about the percentage of women who wear glasses, and the break down by Rx type: myopia; hyperopia; astigmatism; full time wear and degree of Rx ; etc. </p><p> </p><p>I've never seen any particularly good data about this.  There was a post on this site maybe a month or two ago (I forget which thread) in which someone reported a breakdown by Rx. </p><p> </p><p>My experience between looking around reading, etc, is that the answers vary a LOT depending on demographics.  As far as I know, there isn't a big difference between men and women.  Certain Asian countries supposedly are about 80% nearsighted.  I've read that about 25% of Americans are nearsighted...but among my friends (Americans, mostly white, 20s and 30s, who mostly went to pretty intense colleges) the number is more like 75%.  One thing that makes it tricky is that most nearsighted young women wear contacts.  For example, of 15 friends/girlfriends of mine, 12 of them were nearsighted...of those 12, all but one wore contacts at least a fair amount of the time, and only two or three others wore glasses more than on a rare occasion.  (By the way, since so many of them wear contacts, and since I really don't think I can tell most of the time whether someone wears contacts, I am pretty sure that my being an OO didn't really contribute to ending up getting close to so many nearsighted women.  I could be wrong, of course...)   Although I'm not sure, I don't think all that many people I know have had LASIK.  I think among friends and acquaintances, I know of 5 (out of maybe 100 who I know well enough to know whether they had it done).  But there are statistics on how many people have had the procedure - I just haven't seen them. </p><p> </p><p>As for bifocals, I don't think I remember a gwg in her 20s or early 30s who wore bifocals.  A couple girls in high school did - I think because they had eye doctors who believed it could help limit progression of myopia.  I did have a friend (about 26 yrs old)once whose eye doctor was considering prescribing bifocals because she was having trouble with eyestrain at work (engineer - lots of computer work and detailed drawings, reading, etc), but I think she waived that off.  Since she was about a -2 or so, she could probably just take her glasses off.  It seems from my experience like bifocals are rare for people in their 20s (like 1 in 100 or less), though there have been quite a few posts on this site by such people.  So I'm curious.  There is definitely an attitude that bifocals are for old people, which is a pretty damaging attitude for any young person who needs them to see better. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas </b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2006, 22:04</p><p>Also Astigmatism is due to the cornea of the eye or in some rare cases the retina to be shaped like an (American) football - 0 - instead of  being shaped like a socker or basketball - O -. This causes light to be focused in more than one point on the retina. So yes, a "shadow" affect when reading a printed page or simular symptoms such as one eye seeing color shaded slightly differently than the other eye, is likely caused by astigmatism. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2006, 21:49</p><p>Jane your vision is somewhat rare in that one eye is myopic and the other is hyperopic. Though I did know two people who has this condition. The one fellow never liked to wear his glasses but the other, a young woman almost never took her's off. You are fortunate in that your Rx is mild because too great a difference in Rx for each eye leads one eye to do all the work while the other eye may atrophy after time. Astigamtism is a very common condition and most people needing glasses for other eye disorder such as myopia also have some degree of astigmatism. As for prisms, they are used to correct stabismus also known as cross eyes. Sense light through a prism always bends toward the base of the prism it allows a person who's eye may turn outward to see straight ahead when a prism base in the lens is placed near the bridge of the nose.  </p><p>As for your eyesight. I would suggest you wear your glasses full time for several weeks so to allow your eyes "adjust" to your new vision. But truly it is ones brain that really is doing the adjusting. Our eyes are simply a pathway for the brain to "see".</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jane</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2006, 21:03</p><p>Thank you for replying to my post.  From memory, my script is -0.5/-0.5 (right) and +0.5/+0.25 (left). I know that this is very slight.  With my left eye there is no noticeable difference for istance vision whether I wear my glasses or not. With my right eye, even thought it is still a weak prescription, when I do not wear glasses everything further than about 2m away is not really clear and I have noticeable double vision when i look at print. Is this due to the astigmatism? </p><p> </p><p>As for reading, when print is blurry there does seem to be a shadow type of effect, kind of like double vision i guess. I also seem to have to strain more with near work when I use both of my eyes.  </p><p> </p><p>I don't know what prescription the optometrist would give me for close work as she suggested that I come back in about a month and in the mean time, document any problems I have with near work. She suggested this because I was a bit reluctant to get reading glasses as I am only 29 and thought this was a bit young. If I start wearing reading glasses now, won't I just keep on needing stronger and stronger ones? </p><p> </p><p>With the "ruler" she did say that the arrow should be at zero so i guess this means i do have an alignment problem. Can reading glasses help with this or would i need prisms? Can any one tell me a bit more about prisms or is there somewhere else on this website where they are explained?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2006, 15:05</p><p>Jane, </p><p>It would be very helpful if you could provide your new prescription and age. </p><p>I suspect the test you described as a ï¿½rulerï¿½ test may have been a test for muscle imbalance.  The way it works is that one eye sees the rule with the numbers and the other eye sees the arrow.  Normally, if a person sees the arrow pointing near the ï¿½0" it means that there is no muscle imbalance.  However, that is not necessarily the case. The center point on many machines is adjustable so that the operator can offset the center point to other values   If you saw the arrow hovering between the  9 and 11 it could mean that you have about 10 prism diopters of muscle imbalance or it could mean that the center point was adjusted to 10 and you have no muscle imbalance.  This type of test is normally used for ï¿½screeningï¿½ purposes and if the Examiner decides that some prism would be useful, the phoropter has the ability to more accurately measure prism requirements.   </p><p>Just because you saw the arrow between 9 and 11 does not mean that you need prism.  Have you experienced any double vision?   </p><p>BTW, 10 diopters of prism is not much. Glasses with 10 diopters of prism are usually made with 5 diopters in each eye and each eye would be deflected about 2.5 degrees. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2006, 08:17</p><p>I would be very interested in a reply to Jane's query. </p><p>When I was 18 I knew I was getting a bit short-sighted so went for a first eyetest. I told the optician that I had suffered headaches (because I thought that would get me glasses!) and he tested me in the way Jane describes. I think that, like Jane, I recorded a less than "perfect" result. But when the optician discovered from the Snelling chart that I was indeed a bit short-sighted (-.5 I think) he seemed confused. It was as if the two tests had yielded inconsistent findings. He put on his own glasses and applied the "ruler" test to himself. And he muttered something about the equipment possibly being dodgy. In the end he concluded that my eyesight was not "bad" enough to require him to prescribe glasses. In fact I think it was because it was time for his lunch! </p><p>Four years later (after reading law at Oxford) I went for another eye test. My rx was by then -2.75 and I got my glasses. The optician refused to believe they were my first. The ruler didn't feature and has never featured at any test since, even since I became presbyopic and have needed an add. </p><p>So what was the "ruler" testing? Why did it confuse that first optician? And why hasn't it been used on me since?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jane</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2006, 04:00</p><p>This is my first post to this site,so i am sorry if i ask questions that have been answered before.  I just went for an eye test as it had been a couple of years since my last. (I am slightly short-sighted in my right eye and slightly longsighted in my left with some astigmatism in both). Anyway, lately i have been having a lot of trouble focussing on near work. It often goes in and out of focus and i find it hard to stop my eyes from straying around the page (does that make sense?)and have been getting head aches. </p><p> </p><p>The optometrist said that I need a reading prescription now. She did this test where I had to look through an instrument and tell her which number on a ruler the arrow lined up with. It is apparently supposed to line up in the middle at 0 but for me it was a long way to the right (hovering between 9 and 11). Can someone please tell me what this means and whether glasses will help overcome this problem. Thank you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tsirt emotpo</b>&nbsp;18 Aug 2006, 14:05</p><p>Candice, your boyfriend is nearsighted/myopic with a small amount of astigmatism.  In my opinion, he has a low Rx and can likely function fairly well at most distances closer than 10 feet but further out than this he will run into an issue with seeing fine detail.  You have a boring Rx, farsighted with some astigmatism, a very common prescription when you look at the general population.  I doubt your contacts are the exact same Rx as your glasses, most toric contacts only come in either -0.75 steps of cylinder units and few correct in -1.00 units (I think focus toric still do).  When you wear his Rx with your contacts you are effectively making yourself far-sighted again (like your eyes are naturally).  Vice versa, if he wears your glasses he makes his eyes effectively more near-sighted (his distance vision will be even more blurry).  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Candice</b>&nbsp;14 Aug 2006, 06:36</p><p>Hi..I wear glasses with a rx of R+1.5 -1.25 X80 L+1.5 -1.00 X70.I wear contacts most of the time though.I am 30 years old.My boyfriend got glasses about 6 months ago.The rx is L-0.75 -0.25 x 100 R-1.00 -0.5 x 160.He only uses the glasses from driving at night.I was just wondering if this is normal as the lenses don't look that weak.I see people wearing glasses of that strengh fulltime everyday in shopping malls.He claims that his vision is fine for driving during the day and for TV.I would love him to be a full time wearer.He is 25 years old.Will his eyes get worse as he get older that he will become a fulltime wearer or has it stabilised by this age?When I try his glasses on over my contacts they still feel fairly strong.Why does my glasses or contacts not neautralise his prescription.Would I need stronger contacts or is it the astigmatism.Is my vision worse than his uncorrected at say 50 yards judging from these prescriptions.He seems to have a bit more difficulty than me at distance at night.I just can't understand how he can walk around a mall without glasses on.I cannot bare to be without correction.I feel so much more relaxed if I do not have continous blur and eyestrain.At my prescription is it normal for my glasses and contact prescription to be the same?Whenever is get new disposables they have to be ordered for me.Is my prescription very rare? </p><p>Hope someone can give me insight into these question...Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2006, 06:38</p><p>Miriam, that's quite an unusual rx!  </p><p>With your left eye you might find that the -1 for distance lets you see more crisply for driving, tv etc. But for close work the add means that you will see exactly if you weren't wearing specs. </p><p>With the right I would have thought that the total of +2.5 for close stuff would make quite a difference when reading etc. And you will probably be more comfortable with distance vision too as you get used to wearing specs. Until now you have probably accommodated that degree of longsightedness but as one gets older one needs the help of a lense. </p><p>I would get a nice pair of specs made up and see how you go. You may feel more comfortable wearing them with the extra clarity they give you. But there are no "rules" about how often to wear specs. If you think uyou would be self-conscious with lined bifocals go for varifocals. In my experience it is well worth paying a bit extra for a high grade lense like Zeiss. </p><p>You'll probably soon find that you did not know how you managed without glasses. And you'll be flattered by the attention they bring you. Most women considerably enhance their attractiveness by wearing nice frames. And with good quality varifocal lenses you won't look "old ladyish"! They'll be indistinguishable from single vision lenses but avoid you having to have multiple pairs for close and distance vision. </p><p>Give it a go and let us know how you get on. Good luck.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>EyeSpy</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2006, 23:23</p><p>Iï¿½ve heard that a measure like 20/200 is influenced by whether the person corrects to 20/20, or better, or worse. So 20/200 could be the case for some -2.50 myopes but probably not for most. I only correct to 20/25 in one eye so up against others who correct to 20/20 I guess my ï¿½visual efficiencyï¿½ would be worse. Does that make my uncorrected vision worse than someone with the same prescription? Probably not I donï¿½t really know. </p><p>At -2.50 Iï¿½d say it starts to become more difficult to function without glasses and there are more things that require glasses than not, for people who want to see well that is. (ï¿½Managingï¿½ as you put it Philosofer is slightly different). I think John probably gets closest ï¿½ both have difficulty seeing in the distance but what really makes the difference is not being able to see up close either.

<p><b>John</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2006, 20:19</p><p>Philosopher - One of the biggest reasons that a person with 2.5 D of myopia can manage fine but a person who is legally blind (20/200) will have real difficulty is that the legally blind person can't see things up close any better than things far away.  The myope can read (up close) just fine, and that's a huge difference.  (Granted, it won't make a difference doing something like driving...but neither of these people can drive safely.)</p><p></p><hr>

'Best corrected' vision worse than 20/200 is the 'legal definition of blindness'. Therefore at or above 2.50 diopter of 'uncorrected' myopia the eyesight is reduced to a vision-level that defines 'legal blindness'. Without glasses or contact lenses, a myope of -2.50 D sees what a legally blind person is able to see (with his/her best corrected eye)." </p><p> </p><p>What I thought I had read before is that 4.00 - not 2.50 - dioptres of myopia reduces vision to 20/200 ? </p><p>And, though I have not heard the term 'visual efficiency' before, intuition would suggest that 20/200 sounds more like 10% than 20% efficient ? </p><p>And, finally, I know all too sadly and from long personal experience, that a female person with 2.50 dioptres of myopia can manage perfectly well for most practical purposes (except watching TV and driving), so I really must believe than she is seeing better than - even the corrected vision - of someone who is legally classified as blind ? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2006, 06:24</p><p>Well guest, I am not 100% sure, however I believe that up to -1.00D of astigmatism can sometimes be corrected by adding -0.50D to the sphere. The usual rule of thumb is that 1/2 of the astigmatism correction is added to the sphere.  And over -1.00D of astigmatism pretty well requites toric contact lenses. Although back in the days of hard plastic contacts as much as -3.00D of astigmatism could be corrected by adding to the sphere.  I think RGP contacts work much the same way, as the hard lenses reshape the irregular cornea. However, I do not know any of this absolutely for sure.</p><p></p><hr>

If someone had some astigmatism that was only corrected by sphere in their contacts, say -2.50 but with the astigmatism correction the contacts were -2.75, how much real astigmatism is being corrected by the extra -.25 in the contacts? </p><p> </p><p>Secondly, how much can be corrected by sphere?

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;13 May 2006, 20:45</p><p>Philosifer, I know some high myopes and have tried GOC up to -36. </p><p>I think the vision centres in the brain adapt incredibly well to glasses, even with very strong lenses.  Retina problems aside, I think acuity with glasses over -20 can be surprisingly good.  I have noticed, though, that people with very strong glasses seem to lose a lot of co-ordination with objects in space.  They seem to find ball sports much more difficult, for example, stepping onto stairs and even reaching for something can take a split second more attention than someone with normal vision would need. </p><p>It seems to me that people with strong glasses tend to gravitate towards sedentary occupations and activities.  This is not just a stereotype, it's  because of real visual limitation.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;13 May 2006, 14:19</p><p>Philosifer - that is an interesting question. I suppose that of the problems that strongish glasses can cause, some disappear once you are used to the glasses (like straight lines appearing curved) and some don't (like blurred peripheral vision). My boyfriend has almost the same prescription as your wife (-4.75, -6.00 with some astigmatism) and has never even tried contacts. I would be fascinated to see his reaction to the vision he could get with them, but worried that that would be the end of his glasses! A friend of his with -5.00 got contacts 'to try' a couple of months ago and hasn't been seen in glasses since - he is now talking about laser surgery.  </p><p> </p><p>Problems such as chromatic abberation and blurred peripheral vision are made quite a bit worse by high index lenses, but I don't think opticians tend to point this out to people - it is usually more like 'you have to get these expensive lenses or your glasses will be incredibly ugly and thick'. :(</p><p></p><hr>

Most of the time, these things don't matter - like field-of-vision (it's not really peripheral vision, but rather the ability to turn my eyes toward something/someone without turning my head and see it clearly).  Certainly, being outside in the rain without a hat is a lot less pleasant in glasses than in contacts.  I wouldn't seriously consider trying to play sports in glasses unless there was no way I could wear contacts.  Most of the rest of the time, it makes little difference, as "acuity" is what seems to matter most in vision, even though it isn't the whole story. </p><p> </p><p>I've done some GOC, and I'd say the difference between glasses and contacts in these 'other' aspects of vision besides acuity gets larger and larger the higher the prescription.  There really is quite a bit of distortion (or a very small field of vision, or both) with -20 glasses. </p><p> </p><p>As for acuity (just the ability to, say, read an eye chart), there is some point where minification decreases acuity, but I think it's at a higher point than most of the fantasy stories I've read via EyeScene seem to place it.  I have a pair of -28 glasses, and even with them, the minification doesn't seem to cause a loss of potential acuity beyond maybe one line or two (20/25 or 20/30 instead of 20/20). </p><p> </p><p>Of course, real-world high myopes can have retina problems and such, which can be a cause of decreased vision that would be more or less the same whether they wear glasses or contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;12 May 2006, 19:58</p><p>I know from where you speak philosefer. My wife was a similar(-6D) prescription, and wore contacts almost exclusively.  Although, she never once complained that her vision was not as good with glasses. She just hated the idea of being seen wearing glasses in public.  I have known a number of myopes with -10D or greater, and the ones who wear glasses full time seemed to be able to see pretty darned good with glasses.  The ones who wear contacts most of the time bitch about the fact that they can't see as well with glasses.  I know there are a couple of ladies around -25 that I know, one in fact was -30D and -28.50D, and this lady had good enough corrected vision to keep a driver's license.  The lady who was around -25.50R and -22.25L with about -2.25D of astigmatism always told everyone her eyesight was terrible, but every time I had coffee with her, and pointed out something outside, she always was able to see it, so I figured the terrible eyesight part of it wasn't that she didn't see ok, it was just that everyone had told her for years that her glasses were so strong that she must have terrible eyesight - if you follow my thoughts.</p><p></p><hr>

When she puts her glasses on the world gets smaller and her peripheral vision is substantial reduced. </p><p> </p><p>Presumably, it is mostly her 'bad' left eye that is doing this, but it does makes me wonder what the effects of a pair of minus tens are, and does anybody as high as that really have fully satisfactory corrected vision ?

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;26 Apr 2006, 17:48</p><p>I could just float the hypothesis that maybe this optician/eye doc thought that you had the potential for a higher prescription, and wanted to get you there sooner rather than later by means of what might be termed the "reverse Bates Method". </p><p> </p><p>Or else he might have made a mistake. :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Paul</b>&nbsp;26 Apr 2006, 15:26</p><p>Kristen - You asked about the concept of not being able to take "the full prescription".  This is *not* an issue that comes up for nearsighted (minus-prescribed) people like you and me.  It's an issue for farsighted people; if someone has "latent" farsightedness -- that is, it's been there for a long time but they didn't know it -- then their eyes are accustomed to overfocusing all the time.  They can't easily stop doing that all at once and relax their eyes, so sometimes they have to work up to the prescription that allows their eyes to relax completely and see clearly in the distance.   </p><p> </p><p>For nearsighted people, the lens of the eye is typically relaxed...it's just that the focusing power of the eye with the lens relaxed is still too much, allowing the person to see things up close but not in the distance.  For someone who is nearsighted, their full distance prescription will give them clear vision as soon as it is placed before their eyes. </p><p> </p><p>There can still be a period of adjusting to new lenses, but that rarely would mean it made sense to make up a whole pair of glasses in a weaker than full prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

I wasnï¿½t too surprised to find that the vision I got from it was fine, not too strong like before.

I base that thought on my understanding of how the brain processes images. </p><p>There is plenty of evidence that that the brain can teach itself or be trained (programed?) to "see" more than what one would expect by pure logic. </p><p>If given two images of differing quality, the brain quickly learns to select the image from the eye with the sharpest image as the basis of what it "sees" and then fills in what additional details it can, using information from the poorer eye or even from memory. </p><p>A prime example is the regular practice of fitting cataract patients with IOLs of very different powers to provide distance vision with one eye and near vision with the other (Monovision).  In a few days, the patient hardly notices and comfortably goes about his business and still has depth perception.  </p><p>Causing the brain to see something other than what is really there is the basis of most optical illusions.  The eyes see what is there but the brain misinterprets it. </p><p>This ability to construct a "usable" image from memory may also help explain why a person with uncorrected myopia can learn to function quite well with blurry vison except when faced with completely unfamiliar small details. </p><p>There is also plenty of evidence that the brain can quickly reprogram itself if the visual environment suddenly changes - such as getting glasses - and quickly decides that constructing a usable image from lousy data is a waste of time and energy. </p><p>I have experienced some interesting "reprograming" myself. Many years ago, my company was one of the pioneering users of CRTs with flat faces.  When we first got them, nearly everyone thought there was something bad wrong because the data on the screen looked concave.  We were ready to send them back when we began to notice that the longer we looked, the flatter the screen looked until they soon looked normal.  Then it dawned on us that we were used to looking at CRTs with curved face plates that looked flat and until our brains reprogramed themselves they were "correcting" the flat images to look concave.  Curiously, both curved and flat CRTs looked flat from then on. </p><p>Enough said. You don't have to take my word for it or theorize. If you can get hold of a trial lens set, you can set up the conditions described in your question and experiment for yourself. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;24 Apr 2006, 17:20</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p> </p><p>So when does the 'threshold' as such get reached. I mean, surely L -2.00, R -4.50 is not better than L -2.50 and R -2.50 is it?!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Apr 2006, 15:54</p><p>Guest, </p><p>Certainly.  If the two people wore corrective lenses and assuming there was nothing else wrong, they both should have been corrected to 0.00 refractive error and have equally good vision.   </p><p>In your second proposition, the individual with -2.25/-2.50 would have better uncorrected vision than the individual with -2.25/-3.00.  Even though the brain selected the eye with -2.25 as the source for a distant image, the eye with -2.50 would supply more/better supplemental information than the -3.00 eye. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;24 Apr 2006, 13:49</p><p>That assumes that both the -2.50/-2.50 and the -2.25/-2.75 wearers are going without correction. I have to say why would they? </p><p> </p><p>I see your reasoning but when does the process you describe Cactus Jack break down. Is -2.25/-3 still better than -2.250/-2.50?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Apr 2006, 12:01</p><p>REd, </p><p>Did you win the bet? </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Apr 2006, 12:00</p><p>REd, </p><p>It is hard to believe, but -2.50 / -2.50 is worse. </p><p>Vision occurs in the brain and the brain automatically selects the best image for the situation. Therefore, if a person has -2.25 / -2.75 the brain will usually select the -2.25 eye as supplying the better distance image  and supplement it with information from the -2.75 eye if useful. </p><p>In many respects it is a form of monovision, but instead of one eye being for distance and the other for close up, the -2.25 eye is for close and the -2.75 eye is for closer. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;24 Apr 2006, 06:20</p><p>Jer, </p><p>It depends on the elements of your Rx that have changeed: Sphere, Cylinder, Axis or all three. If sphere only, Left -0.25 to -0.50 increase.  Right -0.50 to -0.75. If cylinder or axis nearly impossible to estimate. </p><p>All this is very subjective and depends on your tolerance of blur, your preferences, your skill at working with the examiner, and the skill of the examiner to arrive at an accurate Rx. </p><p>In any event, the change will probably not be noticable to anyone but you - unless you change frame styles. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2006, 16:40</p><p>Guest remember 'relatively low' is in professional terms. It would not be considered 'low' by the person who was uncorrected at -2.75. </p><p> </p><p>It is all about relativity. Compared with a plano, -2.75 is 100's times worse. Compared with a -5.00, it is 100's times better. In my view, anything over about -2.00-2.50, is 'high enough', because one is inhibited without correction as much as someone with a higher presciption (withinin reason!) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2006, 12:40</p><p>Guest, </p><p>I was being facetious. -2.75 means what I said about anything beyond 14 inches or 36 cm being blurry.  If the TV is farther than that distance you couldn't read any text and if there were no sound, you would have little idea about what was going on.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2006, 09:38</p><p>Guest, </p><p>They would need to wear them only when they wanted to see clearly beyond about 14 inches or 36 cm.

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2006, 11:05</p><p>Karly - that must be difficult for you. I'm -2.75 and wear contacts all eek, during the weekend I give myself a rest from the contacts and wear glasses. I too have mother who finds it hard to accept that her offspring is less than perfect, but she's beginning to understand. That's happened just naturally when she's pointed out things that I couldn't see. For me, it wasn't intentional - but you could try that, she probably doesn't realise what you can/can't see and thinkis it's just a fashion=thing (mum's are like that eh?).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Karly</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2006, 10:15</p><p>That's my prescription. I don't even wear half of the time becuase boyfriend and my mom disapprove.

<p><b>Joe</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2006, 08:36</p><p>Hello glasses fans </p><p>If you were -2.75 and -2.25 how much would you be wearing your glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>presbyopia_23</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2006, 09:27</p><p>welcome back specs4ever! The best way for me to tell the power of someone's glasses is try it on. If they are too weak, ill see well from near and still blurry from distance. If they are near the right power, distance will be clear and near will be somewhat blurry. If they are too strong, I dont see a thing from near and blurry from even distance. Astigmastim can be found by rotating the lens to check for disortions. If I dont try the glasses, I judge by thickness, minification and cut.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Johanna Mueben</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2006, 02:27</p><p>To Larika: But by observing the cut, you often could notice the thickness of the lens because a thick lens would produce much blur, and from Serna's pic you could notice the blurry region is very small, probably that's a hi-index lens on her right eye, and prescription is probably about -2D to -3D if it cuts that much. Astigmatism might exist, but must be less than 1.00D at her right eye. I could not determine her left eye but base on the pic it's probably a stronger prescription around -3D or -4D, as spec4ever said. That's because I notice the reflective edge is much thicker.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Serna</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2006, 19:23</p><p>Spec4ever is correct that observing their cut is pretty risky, especially for prescriptions with strong astigmatism. </p><p> </p><p>Larika simply use my posted pic to show an example. Some factors like face shape, lens size, the direction the person is facing corresponding to your camera or eyes, etc. These are factors affect the cuts, but the position of cuts could not show the prescription accurately. </p><p> </p><p>Like, if a person is right facing your eyes or camera, the cuts is not as significant as when the person is looking 30 degrees from your eyes or camera. The same could applied to + lenses as well.  </p><p> </p><p>Another factor is lens size, if one use smaller lens, then you would think one would have smaller prescription, especially when you can't see the cuts! Anyone with less than -5 glasses could do that if they have small lens. And with large lens size, even a small prescription could be shown clearly from the cuts (For example, that pic posted by Larika, actually her prescription by then was about -2.25) </p><p> </p><p>And I think Larika had tried to put her glasses (or her friend's glasses) much away from their eyes, and noticed the image formed is much smaller. Actually this could show how  - glasses could actually diminished the image a lot, if you put it far enough, but in that way our eyes is just like staring through those lenses, no matter it's just weak prescription like -1. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Serna</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2006, 19:05</p><p>I have strong regular astigmatism.  </p><p> </p><p>Left: -0.75 -6.00 90  </p><p>Right: -2.75 -5.50 90 </p><p> </p><p>With glasses, acuity: 20/50 </p><p>Without glasses, acuity: less than 20/400 because of astigmatism.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2006, 13:38</p><p>Specs4Ever - welcome back!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2006, 12:28</p><p>Well, guessing a prescription from the amount of cut in is always risky, and I actually doubt that any of us who do it really can get it correct, as there are a lot of factors to consider. High astigmatism will change the cut in, the angle at which you view the person will change the cut in.  And, sometimes a person who would normally have a lot of cut in will be wearing small frames that mask the amount of cut in.  So, really, all it is is a guess.  The picture that you sent me to would make me guess at about a -3 to a -4D prescription.   </p><p>Different indexes of lenses do not change anything. The important part is the power of the lens, and a -15D lens acts the same if it is in a 1.9 hi index, or a 1.5 low index. </p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Larika</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2006, 01:28</p><p>Actually how would you know other's prescription by looking their "cuts" formed by their glasses? </p><p> </p><p>for example, this pic </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a100/kuusel/pg092.jpg" target="_blank">http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a100/kuusel/pg092.jpg</a> </p><p> </p><p>and we could only notice her glasses is a kind of (-) glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>But I've heard the refractive index of the lenses does affect the position of the "cuts", is that possible a strong prescription could be reduced like the above pic.  </p><p> </p><p>and what's the difference of the "cuts" between a 1.5 lens and a 1.9 lens, I think the 1.5 lens would bent less so the lens would be much thicker... yet would the "cuts" be less significant? </p><p></p><hr>

This makes you a moderate myope(range -3 to -5.75) I am -4.5 in one eye and -5 in the other also making me a moderate myope but considerabily worse than you. You might want to wear glasses full time except when reading something, youll be able to see it clearly from 13" I see clearly from just 9" :( My uncorrected vision is barely 20/400 so im twice as bad as you. We dont like glasses but our vision is bad enough that we dont have a choice except for reading.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"My new Rx is OD -13.25 -1.00 x 10 and OS -12.50 -1.25 x 134." </p><p> </p><p>I read about Tammy's dilemna. He used to be corrected to 20/40 partially due to glasses minification, partially due to astigmastim and also due to the nature of his very high myopia. I was thinking this: can you try moving your glasses closer or further from your nose? It could be a vertex distance issue. As for presbyopia, thats normal, you are 40! Its true high minus glasses are slightly forgiving because they make things seem further away. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2006, 14:34</p><p>Tammy, everybody becomes presbyopic by age 40. Hyperopes get the symptoms usually earlier. Myopes later because they can use their near vison to compensate. Bifocals are prescribed. I knew a girl who is nearsighted but has a lot of astigmatism and has had to wear bifocals sense age 12.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Steve</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2006, 14:30</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for your reply. Does that mean that where the prescription in both eyes is different, then the 'overall visual acuity' of that person is the lowest of the two? i.e. if one eye was -2 and the other -4, is that person's vision with both eyes nearer to -2 then -4?  </p><p> </p><p>The latter prescription is mine and I wear fulltime but the other was a friend of mine who only wears for driving and tv etc. My prescription is very similar in both eyes but my brother has -1 difference between eyes and he says that with both eyes he sees the equivalent to his right(stronger eye) its not until he covers the stronger eye up that the vision deteriorates. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wei</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2006, 13:59</p><p>Tammy you think you need of myodisc soon?  Is aciuty worsen due to astegmatism?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2006, 09:58</p><p>You're right i don't drive. As far as my va is concerned, yes it does impact my view of the world. In regards to my age, i'm in my 40's.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2006, 03:52</p><p>Tammy, does your visual acuity have an effect on the way you see the world, other than eyecharts? Yes, I realise you shouldn't be driving. And your astimagtism seems to change all the time, "???" comes to mind. Oh... how old are you? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2006, 19:26</p><p>I really don't know why my visual acuity has gone down. The optometrist said that i am missing pieces of letters. Also, get this...he said that now, not only am i highly nearsighted, but now i am also presbyopic...lol. I do realize that it's fairly rare for someone as nearsighted as i am to have presbyopia too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2006, 18:24</p><p>Tammy, I was going to say something very like what Tod said. How come it's gone down??</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2006, 18:14</p><p>Steve: Uncorrected, #2 has the poorest vison because the images from both eyes are blurry.  #1 obviously has the poorest monocular vision in the left eye but fairly good distance vision in the right eye.  If the astigmaitsm were corrrected #1 would have good "natural monovision" by using the right eye for distance and the left eye for reading.  The left eye is focused at 13 inches (33 cm). </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2006, 18:02</p><p>The optometrist told me that my prescription went up in one eye and down in the other. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2006, 12:57</p><p>Tammy, I may be all wet but your new Rx that you posted seems less strong than your old Rx. Maybe that's why you are only seeing 20/50 and 20/60 instead of 20/40. Best check back with your optom about this.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2006, 02:13</p><p>Lazysiow: To keep from getting confused in my previous post, what I described is the view looking at trial frame (AO, I think) and describing what I saw. </p><p>If someone is refracting me, I always ask them to place my hand on the angle knob of the phoropter or trial frame so I can make the final adjustment. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2005, 12:01</p><p>I can't answer your question, atrici, as in those days, there was no obligation on the optician to tell you it, and my sight was not good enough to see what was written down at the patient - optician's desk distance.   It happened because I was at School, and was putting my glasses on before the start of a lesson, and then removing them at the end, walking to another room bare-eyed, and then putting them on again.   This seemed a bit pointless, so I started wearing them full time.   With hindsight, I would guess I was about -4.00ish, but I'm not at all certain.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hollie</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2005, 03:30</p><p>Jamie, I agree with Julian, just wear them! I couldn't wear my contacts for 6 months so I went around in a blur, I was about -3.50 and had astigmatism too. Looking back I was stupid not to wear them all the time. I had to squint to see anything further than about a foot away clearly, and couldn't recognise friends in the street. I only wore them for university and driving.  </p><p>Now I'm around -4 and always wear some sort of correction, sometimes glasses and sometimes contacts. Get contacts if you can- I know I feel a lot more comfortable in mine, more confident.  </p><p>But you'll definitely look better with a well-chosen pair of glasses on your face than squinting all the time- guaranteed!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wei</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2005, 01:42</p><p>Yes Jeremy Julian is corect.  Perhaps ask girlfriend for choose glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

May as well be realistic: they're getting worse and likely to go on getting worse; you can expect to need stronger glasses every year or two till they stabilize, probably sometime in your twenties. You are alrady short-sighted enough to be at a disadvantage if you go around without correction, so you need to get over your hang-up about wearing your glasses full time - or if you can't do that get contacts. You aren't alone in this; there are thousands, millions even, in the same position.  </p><p>Jamie, you're another; for pity's sake, your girl friend likes you to wear your specs; just keep them on and enjoy the view!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2005, 05:52</p><p>Jamie,  When was the last time that your girlfriend had her eyes tested?   You should try to get her to go to the eye doctor and who knows, maybe she will need glasses and you can bug her and try to get her to wear her glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2005, 14:03</p><p>Jamie:  I can understand why your gf is annoyed with you.  A person with a -3.00 Rx is a nuisance (and not much fun to be around) when not wearing their glasses or contacts.  Because everything beyond 13 in (33 cm) is a blur, they either have to squint, struggle, or be constantly asking someone to tell them what something says when they ought to be able to read it with a glance. </p><p>Also, I'm a little annoyed because I don't understand why some people think they need someone else's permission to see well, without effort, all the time.  I know people with a plus or minus 0.25 who would not even consider not wearing their glasses all the time.  It is YOUR vison, YOUR glasses, and YOUR decision. </p><p>Your gf probably likes you better when you are wearing your glasses for several reasons, but if you are lucky, she may even have a slight glasses fetish.  If so, enjoy! </p><p>C. </p><p>     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wei</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2005, 13:29</p><p>Jamie why you not wear glasses all time it seem you want wear them anyway so is not problem, see?  Is no point not to wear glasses i think. Get contacts if you not like wear glasses all time.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jamie</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2005, 11:54</p><p>Iï¿½m wondering at what strength people usually start to wear their glasses all of the time.  My girlfriend who has got perfect sight has been getting irritated with me recently for not being able to see things properly.  Iï¿½ve just ordered some new glasses which my girlfriend wants me to wear all the time.   </p><p> </p><p>Iï¿½ve had glasses for two years, since I started to drive.  Usually I just wear them for driving or when Iï¿½m in a lecture at university.  I know that recently my eyes have changed and that things arenï¿½t as clear with my glasses on as they used to be and Iï¿½ve started to wear them a bit more often, I now use them to watch television or at the cinema.  The other thing that Iï¿½ve noticed is that before I used to take my glasses off as soon as Iï¿½d finished lectures, driving, etc, but now I sometimes leave them on.  </p><p> </p><p>Most of the time at home and for things like shopping, socialising and work Iï¿½ve been going around without my glasses.  My girlfriend has been getting annoyed recently that Iï¿½ve been squinting a bit and canï¿½t always see things clearly.  I got a reminder card from the optician just before Christmas.  My girlfriend booked the appointment, convinced that Iï¿½d be told to wear my glasses all the time.   </p><p> </p><p>I went for my check up today.  As I suspected, my eyes have got slightly worse: my new prescription is left eye ï¿½3.00, -0.25, 90; right eye ï¿½3.00.   The optician did not offer any advice about how often I should wear my new glasses, but she may well think that I already wear them full time, because I had them on when I went in and after the test when she took off the trial frames she gave me back my old glasses and said that I could put them back on, which I did.  After the sight test, my girlfriend and I spent some time choosing new glasses, which should be ready later in the week. </p><p> </p><p>I guess the fact that Iï¿½m starting to leave my glasses on once Iï¿½ve put them on is a good indication of the fact that I probably should be wearing them more often.  Also, by doing so I will please my girlfriend.  However, I donï¿½t know if I really want to wear them most/all of the time.  Any advice would be appreciated.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b><a href="http://eyescene.net/bbs/real.html" target="_blank">Julian</a></b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2005, 03:58</p><p>Good grief Jeremy, a first prescription of -3.00/-3.75? As you've only learned to drive in the past year I imagine you're in your late teens - how did you cope in school? At that age it's fairly normal for myopia to get worse with or without glasses; you can't put it down to wearing them, and after all you need them to see. Some people reckon that if you take them off for close work that can slow the progression down. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jeremy</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2005, 23:54</p><p>Yah, I think I should get stronger glasses.  I mean I can see pretty clear with the ones I have on now, but I mean there is something I still have to kinda focus on to see.  I am -3 in the left eye and -3.75 in the right eye, if I remember off the top of my head.   </p><p> </p><p>When I first got my glasses (these are my first pair ever). Before that I was squinting a lot and everything was a blur, when I got my glasses I kinda chicken out and didn't wear them, but more and more I noticed I just had to have them. So maybe that made my vision a lot worse?  But, for a while I have been wearing them full time.  And even when I don't wear them I think I am squinting all the time, just naturally.   </p><p> </p><p>I also believe like you my right eye is significantly worse than my left eye with and without my glasses.  Plus I want new frames :).  So, I probably should visit the eye doctor very soon.  Because I do like my vision crisp.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glinthia</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2005, 21:03</p><p>Hi Jeremy, </p><p> </p><p>Your eyesight is really bad, but mine is not much better than yours. I wear -9.5 in my right eye while -1.75 in my left eye, and I have quite significant astigmatism in my right eye. It's very uncomfortable to drive without my glasses of course. I have another -1.5 glasses for both eyes. (That's a fake prescription, I just try it for fun) And I can see everything comfortably by covering my right eye. Yes, I sometimes cover my right eye in order to see things more clearly, it disturb my sight.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jeremy</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2005, 07:16</p><p>I can see decent when I'm driving.  When I took the eyetest for the driver's licence 9 months ago.  I passed it with my glasses on, but I noticed I had to focus for a second, and it could be clearer.  I have kinda been embarassed by having to wear glasses so I really hadn't until then.  But, I would rather have as clear vision as possible, because squinting is annoying.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jeremy</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2005, 04:33</p><p>hey all.. </p><p>I took that test on the eye chart and I tested I think 20/400.But I don't know if it is accurate, because on the snellan chart I could make out 20/200 with a lot of fuzz, I made it out, but I think I squinted.  When I took the picture test it was very hard to make out.  The 20/200 line I couldn't see at all..the 20/400 I barely made out with a squint.  So, I put on my glasses and I could only see to the 20/60 line.  When I did the letters I could see down to 20/40..so any suggestions.  I haven't had an eye test for two years and that was the last time I got my glasses.  I never remember my vision being that bad. </p><p> </p><p>So do I test to where I can see clear or  the time where I can barely make out the letter or picture...any who, I don't think with my glasses I can quite make out 20/40-20/60.  So is it time for a lot stronger pair of eyeglasses or will these do?</p><p></p><hr>

The reported criteria used by practising optometrists were investigated using a questionnaire to survey prescribing habits for borderline hypermetropia, presbyopia, astigmatism, and horizontal and vertical heterophoria. Thirty-eight questionnaires were returned and the results analysed. We calculated the ï¿½cut offï¿½ point above which the anomaly would be corrected over 50% of the time that it was encountered. There was a large variation for each category, but it was clear that the presence or absence of symptoms was an important factor for most optometrists when deciding whether to correct a small error. It was found that for symptomatic patients, most optometrists would correct an anomaly if it reached: +1.00 D of hypermetropia, a reading addition of +0.75 D for presbyopia, -0.75 DC of astigmatism, 1.5 prism dioptres () of horizontal aligning prism, and 1  of vertical dissociated heterophoria. For asymptomatic patients, optometrists would not correct any of the hypermetropic anomalies or heterophorias that were specified in our questionnaire. However most would correct a presbyopic error of +1.50 D or above, or an astigmatic error of -1.50 DC or above, even in the absence of symptoms. These results were compared with previously published guidelines.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

I know I was 20/50 at -1 and thats with a 20/25 BCVA. I woulda been 20/40 if I was 20/20 with glasses. -2 diopters results in an accuracy of 20/100 for many people(some even 20/70) but I can see it being worse than that if your BCVA is less than 20/20, Somewhere between 20/100 and 20/200. -3 diopters results in 20/200 if your BCVA is 20/25 or better, sometimes 20/30. -4 is generally the limit for 20/200 and youd need a BCVA of like 20/15. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Theres alot of disagreement how diopters correlates to 20/something and the "rule" can vary on the person, their BCVA, even in the setting and light.

I am assuming 20/25 due to glasses minification where that line would be about the size of the 20/20 line if you have contacts or for someone whos plano. Therefore a -1 diopter undercorrection will indeed result in 20/50 or "half vision accuracy" I tested my sister's friend who can read the 20/13 line then I give her +1 glasses and shes not quite 20/25 but can see all of the 20/30 with +1.5 she sees 20/40.  </p><p> </p><p>To the guy who can see 20/80 with -2.25 and worse than 20/100 with -2.75, this also goes accurately with diopters vs. 20/xxx but you are a mild myope and have functional uncorrected vision, especially in your better -2.25 eye</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2005, 15:54</p><p>Hi, Lauren, </p><p>I'm also nearsighted, but more so than you.  I'm in the -10 range, and I'vce had 13 different prescriptions since I bedgan wearing glasses, so I've learned a lot about prescriptions and vision.  When I go for an eye exam and my vision with my old glasses is 20/50, my new preswcription is usually aboyut -1.00 stronger.  One time I pushed my exam off until my vision was 20/70 and my new lenses weree either -1.25 or -1.50 stronger, I forget which.  So with 20/100 vision, you will probably need between -1.50 and -2.00 more of correction (assuming your self-test is accurate).  I'd schedule an eye exam without delay!  You will love how well you will see through your new glasses.  Goold luck!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2005, 14:19</p><p>lauren - The reason you haven't received good answers is that the questions you asked are nearly impossible to answer without long explanations - sort of like asking what is the square root of orange. </p><p>Part of the problem is that we don't know the actual size of the letters on the chart as you viewed it nor the distance.  Maybe, this will help a little.   </p><p>An eye chart of the size used in a doctors office is designed to be seen sharp and clear at a distance of 20 feet.  A 'normal' eye can read the 20/20 line with ease and may be able to make out a few letters on the 20/15 line, but it takes effort and guess work. it is not significant if they can't. </p><p>To a nearsighted person the chart will be fuzzy, but there is no accurate optical power correlation between the degree of fuzzyiness (is it a little fuzzy or a lot fuzzy?) and the Rx required to make it clear.  Based on what you said, I would guess that you need an additional -0.50 to -1.00 power in your glasses to see the chart sharp and clear and read the 20/20 line easily at 20 feet.  The only way to determine the exact amout is an eye exam. </p><p>BTW, an eye exam is not a test in the academic sense, you can't "fail" it.  The object is to determine what optical correction (if any) you need to see as clearly as you can. </p><p>Good luck.  Get an eye exam, get some attractive new glasses - if you need them - and get on with your life.  Not seeing well is a bummer. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2005, 13:55</p><p>Lauren, you should take the test with the glasses you have now. I assume you're a full-time wearer. As for the chart itself - yes, you need to correctly identify all the letters on a given line to get that level of acuity. It doesn't how the letter looks, but obviously if you're squinting like crazy and pushing the glasses against your face, etc, well, I think that's a bit of a cheat that won't fool anyone, certainly not an optician.  </p><p> </p><p>As for the scaling factor, I'm reasonably sure that the size of the letters on a normal chart (on a wall) is in proportion to the distance at which it should be read at. This nice site does the scaling for you according to distance. I think if you do it from nearer to the computer screen, the site might rescale the letters so you can check the in-between lines. BTW if you try it too close up, the site doesn't have a row of letters small enough to test you with. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ardief</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2005, 16:03</p><p>I would say their logic is seriously flawed. After all, the issue is not the level of correction, it's the difficulty in functioning uncorrected. Even a prescription that is slightly insufficient would provide a level of functionality. I agree, Puffin, it's a pretty feeble excuse.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2005, 15:45</p><p>Here's a question, if I may. If one had a small prescription, say minus 1.5, and had glasses made to correct this - then the prescription goes up to say minus 1.75 or 2, could you say that it's not worth wearing the glasses full time because they're the wrong prescription? Or do you think that, as I do, that this is a feeble excuse from someone who doesn't want to wear them? </p><p> </p><p>(ps this is based on real-world friend, would appreciate answers!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2005, 08:04</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Lauren, </p><p> </p><p>Your eyes have got substantially more myopic, and you'd probably benefit from going for an exam and getting a new prescription.  I would venture to guess that you will need at least two diopters of additional correction to bring your vision up to 20/20. Clearly, you are no longer in the "low myope" range which goes up to -3.  You're now in the "moderate" range of myopia which generally goes up to -6 before it is considered "high" myopia. If you are young and haven't had your eyes tested in over a year there is a very good chance that you have had a substantial increase in your myopia.  Right now you shouldn't be driving a car without additional correction.  You'd never pass a driving eye exam at this point, even with your glasses on.  You might find that by tilting your glasses you can improve your acuity.  Let us know how it goes.</p><p></p><hr>

Hopefully, since both of you are young, some of the almost unbelievable research into artificial vision directly to the visual cortex of the brain will bear fruit and your and your wife will benefit from it. </p><p>Lentifan - I had cataract surgery with IOLs in July of 2001 and I have never regreted it for an instant.  Prior to surgery, my Rx was R -1.50, -1.00 x 110 and L -2.75, -1.50 x 73. </p><p>The IOLs are R +16.50, L +13.00. </p><p>My current Rx is R -1.25, -0.25 x 90, L +0.25, -1.25 x 75. </p><p>With glasses (trifocals) I have slightly better than 20/20 in both eyes. </p><p>The Dr. suggested that one eye be as close to 20/20 as possible and the other eye slightly nearsighted (monovision).  With current IOLs you have no ability to focus and with the monovision, I don't absolutely have to wear glasses if they are inconvenient.  For example: if I have to get up at night, I can read medicine bottles etc. without my glasses and if I had to, here in Texas, I could drive without my glasses if I needed to (though I can't imagine why I would want to). </p><p>Also, if I want to, I can do reasonable ranges of GOC, + / - 20 approximately, without super special $$$ contacts. </p><p>BTW, the surgery was an incredible experience.

I note your advice about IOLs, but I still can't see why choosing spectacles rather than IOLs would substantially reduce VA.  I can understand that the field of vision would be much reduced with spectacles and that there would be magnification and distortion away from the centre of the lens.  But VA would be measured through the centre of the lens? </p><p>Is it possible that the people you know with lenticulars also have some other defect which is reducing their VA? </p><p>I would be interested to know how you cope with your reduced VA and your lenticulars - what you can and can't see, what activities you can and can't do, etc </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoffrey</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2005, 11:26</p><p>Lentifan:  Before the lensectomy I had about +4 glasses.  When I was 9-10 we were living abroad and my younger brother and I got Toxoplasmosis an infection thought caused by undercooked food.  This went to Uveitis which came and went repeatedly over about 3 years and was treated by various medications (we were back home by then).  I developed cataracts plus considerable retinal damage, hence the lensectomies, otherwise I would see nothing.  My brother recovered fully and wears +5 glasses now (he's 2 years younger). </p><p>You mentioned the power of average glasses after lensectomies, I had heard that the natural lens is around +14. </p><p>If I were you, and speaking from some experience, I don't suggest not getting IOLs if you can get them.  You can always do GOC if you want, but I don't know of anyone with lenticulars following a lensectomy whose CVA is 20/20.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2005, 16:58</p><p>Geoffrey, thanks for telling us your Rx.  It is very impressive! </p><p>Did you have a +Rx before your lensectomy or was it all the result of the lensectomy.  I am interested in the range of Rx after lensectomy without implant, as I have the beginnings of cataracts and presumably will have lensectomy myself someday.  I am already toying with the idea of refusing implants so I can wear glasses with + lenses, but your Rx surprises me as I think I read somewhere that the average post-cataract Rx is +11.  Maybe that includes all the myopes who get cataracts and the shift is really more than that. </p><p>Do you have some other defect in addition to your aphakia which reduces your visual acuity? </p><p>Please excuse all the questions, Geoffrey, and I quite understand if you don't want to answer, but there are very few genuine wearers of very high Rx glasses and your experience is very valuable and interesting to us.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoffrey</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2005, 11:50</p><p>Lentifan:  My prescription is +22.0 +3.75 add +4.50 both eyes.  I have had approximately the same since I had a lensectomy when I was 12 (23 now).  They cannot implant IOLs, and I don't tolerate contacts of any sort.  The CVA in my right eye is much better than the left (20/350 vs 20/550) so I really only use one eye.</p><p></p><hr>

If I am right in thinking it was -2.00 then he was making out it was a lot worse than that! He said that he would have to get someone to lead him to the exit if he had to get out in the middle of the night - which is unlikely with this prescription!

Astigmatism is usually caused by the shape of the cornea not being a perfect sphere and is corrected by cylinder in the Rx. It may optically add or subtract slightly to your myopia but it is probably from a different cause.  It doesn't take much change in the shape of the cornea to cause astigmatism, approximately 0.4 mm at the cornea will cause 1 diopter refractive error.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 Aug 2005, 21:23</p><p>AHA - Depends on the width of the lens and the index of the lens material. </p><p> </p><p>I have misplaced my mm scale.  I having to measure in inches and convert to mm.  I have some glasses with 5/5D BO.  The Sph. Rx of the lens is about -2.00.  The lens is about 54 mm wide. Outer edge thickness is approx. 8 </p><p>mm the inter edge is approx 2 mm.  I believe the lens material is CR-39.  The power rings are on the outside with none on the inside.  I would estimate that the prism increases the outer edge thickness a little less than 1 mm per prism diopter. </p><p> </p><p>A lens can be made with BO and BU prism.  It would probably look like a 3D BO lens that had been rotated 45 degrees.   </p><p> </p><p>Your eyes easily handle small horizontal BO prism.  Vertical prism is a different matter because independent up or down movement of the eyes is unnatural for a human. Some lizards do it handily.  Unless you have some vertical muscle imbalance I suggest you stick with BO or BI prism.  You might wind up having to tilt your head to fuse vertically displaced images. </p><p> </p><p>C.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 Aug 2005, 10:24</p><p>AHA  - 1D BO will result in or correct 0.6 degrees of inward convergence which is not very much.  I doubt you will even notice much help with 1D BO.  I had to get 5 BO / 5 BO (3 / 3 degrees) before I noticed much help. </p><p> </p><p>I believe that it would be very difficult to ï¿½damageï¿½ anything with moderate prism.  One thing to remember is that it is absolutely necessary for your eyes to converge (ï¿½crossï¿½) when you look at something up close.  I made up this table of approximate total convergence required to fuse images at various distances.  Normally, each eye has half the total.  The distance is in meters (1 meter = 39.37inches).  I hope the table displays properly. </p><p> </p><p>Distance    + to focus    Prism to Converge </p><p> </p><p>   Far                0.00               0 </p><p>     1m             +1.00              4 </p><p>    0.5              +2.00              8 </p><p>    0.4              +2.50            10 (normal reading distance) </p><p>    0.33            +3.00            12 </p><p>    0.25            +4.00            16 </p><p> </p><p>If your eyes already have a tendency to over converge (which mine do) you may find that wearing prism is very comfortable.  You may also experience something similar to people wanting stronger prescriptions.  You may also find that you see double for a time after taking off your glasses. </p><p> </p><p>One tip.  Most lens makers will try to keep the outside edge thickness as low as possible which can result in a very thin inter edge.  When they mount the lenses the thin edges may distort and introduce Rx errors right where you are looking.  Tell the lens maker to keep the inter edge thick enough to not distort in the frame.  </p><p> </p><p>Also, lenses with more than 10-12 D of prism are hard to make and fit. </p><p> </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;29 Aug 2005, 20:08</p><p>Puffin - I think you are right and my experiences tend to confirm that hypothesis.  Of course, it is highly likely that the lab that made these glasses back in 1995 really didn't know what they were doing. </p><p> </p><p>I think there were several factors: </p><p> </p><p>1.  Optical center not offset from the measured PD inward to where my eyes were looking. </p><p> </p><p>2. Outside of the lens not mounted  forward enough in the frames so my optical axis (9 degrees from straight ahead for 15 diopters) was as near as possible to perpendicular to the lens at the optical center. </p><p> </p><p>3.  Variable Vertex Distance across the lens because of 2 above. </p><p> </p><p>Since my original adventures with those glasses, I have had cataract surgery that corrected most of my refractive error and muscle surgery that corrected most of my strabismus - for a while.  The strabismus seems to rearing its head again but it is different this time.  Before, I had extreme difficulty fusing and maintaining fusion when I was tired (esotropia).  Now, when I'm tired, if the images drift apart, I can fuse them easily (esophoria).  If I close my eyes for a few moments, I will see double when I open them and have to fuse the images again.  I have found that wearing prisms again is very comfortable and keeping images fused with the prisms is effortless.  Before, prisms were necessary, now they are optional. </p><p> </p><p>I have ordered some new 15/15 BO glasses, with my current sphere and cyl. Rx, from a US lab that specializes in complex Rxes.  Until they arrive I'm using my old 15/15 BO glasses with L:+4.25 and R: +1.50 contacts.  I have been very surprised and pleased with the results. </p><p> </p><p>I am very curious to see what the expert lab produces.  I told them to not worry about anything but visual acuity. </p><p> </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p>P.S.  I also tried wearing toric CLs with my sphere and cyl. Rx and prism only 12/12 BO glasses.  The combination worked very well except the torics wouldn't stay at the correct angle on my cornea.  This concept has merit and may be very useful for some people.  </p><p> </p><p>Prism only glasses have no optical center (being optically flat).  The combination may provide a very wide field of good vision if the contacts correct the sphere and cylinder. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;29 Aug 2005, 09:45</p><p>AHA, </p><p> </p><p>A couple of questions: </p><p> </p><p>1. Are you having problems with double vision or just want to wear prisms? (Either one is a valid reason) </p><p> </p><p>2. How old are you? </p><p> </p><p>3. Eyes turned inward (Cross-eyed (Esotropia or Esophoria)) Eyes turned outward (Wall-eyes (exotropia or exophoria))? </p><p> </p><p>Comments based on experience with adult strabismus - esotropia/esophoria (crossed eyes): </p><p> </p><p>1. Less than 5 BO (Base Out) in each eye is barely noticeable. 5 prism diopters is about 3 degrees of correction.  I wore 5/5 BO for about 10 years and it really helped me keep images fused when I was tired.  </p><p> </p><p>2. The highter you go above 11 or 12 diopters BO, the harder the lenses are to make, mount, and fit correctly so that you can see reasonably clearly. </p><p> </p><p>Even after muscle surgery, I occasionally have to wear 15/15 BO to keep images fused.  I also have have to wear low plus contacts to correct the apparent Rx error in the glasses.  With the combination, I see very close to 20/20.  I had to come up with the CL Rx by trial and error about 7-8 years ago before I even heard of GOC.  And had to do it again after cataract surgery - this time with the help of the GOC Excel program and a friendly Optometrist. </p><p> </p><p>3. Making high prism glasses is almost a lost art with modern eye muscle surgery.  One-Hour "labs" simply don't have the toos and skills necessary to do more than a few diopters. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Avoid Fresnel Sitck-ons.  They work fine for the prism but the optical  distortion that occurs when they are attached to a lens cannot be corrected by contacts or accomodation.  They are intended for temporary use in young children who have serious vision development problems and reading is the least of worries. </p><p> </p><p>Hope this helps. </p><p> </p><p>C.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2005, 11:27</p><p>Can anyone help, I pleased someone just mentioned having an add on there prescription as this is what my question is about I've always really had a thing for glasses and before needing them I used to wear reading glasses but really wanted a pair of minus distance glasses and I guessed I might be able to see out of them anyway when I was 20 I got the courage to go and get an eye test and blagged the doctor and got a pair -0.25 in both eyes I really didn't need them as my eye sight was near on perfect but she thought they would help me with head aches I said I got, anyhow as time went on I wanted to get stronger lens but my dream started coming a bit too true and five years down the line I now really do need glasses, I have to say now I don't want to need them well not this much buy hey its happened, I don't know if I should blame my self for wearing glasses when I didn't need them or computer use maybe a bit of both it may not sound much but I'm up to -1.25 in both eyes and my distance vision is not good at all now and its affecting my life, problem is I don't wear them out as the glasses thing is too much of a fetish I just can do it, Right OK I'm going to get to the point now, I've now got a thing for + glasses but can't really see at a distance through them, I did find some weak ones on line +0.25 which I wear for the computer at home, but what I really want now is distance glasses with a + add I've found a shop on line where you just put in your prescription but don't have to send the real thing, so can anyone suggest a prescription i.e.: -1.25 add + 0.50 I don't have anything else on my normal prescription its just -1.25 in both eyes and nothing else so how much of an add do you think would be ok? bearing in mind I do want to see out of them clearly for close and near, and you never know I might start wearing them to work!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ella</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2005, 03:46</p><p>Hi Clare </p><p> </p><p>It didn't so much annoy me as make me think, wow, do I really squint so others notice? Especially the MD, as hes mostly locked away in his office or out on business, and I don't often chat to him. He's a lovely guy, and wears glasses himself, not sure what the prescription is because I have no idea how to guess! I do think hes shortsighted, as he'll take his glasses off to read things and seems perfectly OK, but he'll put them back on whenever he looks anywhere else.  </p><p>It seems pretty strange when a stranger comments though, like your gym incident. They must have been paying pretty close attention to you to notice that :-) </p><p>I've had an interesting sighting at work this week. Lots of people seem to wear contacts, including a woman whos about 35 maybe, who commented last week that she hardly ever wears specs (this was when I showed up the first time in glasses). The end of last week and beginning of this week though, she had them on for a few days. She was suffering from a bad cold, and said her eyes hurt too much to put her contacts in. Her glasses were really nice, kind of a deep purple plastic, and suited her face perfectly. I commented that they were lovely, and she said she'd worn them since she was a child and hated them. They were quite thick (again, no idea about prescription) and made her eyes look a bit smaller than mine do, so I'm guessing her prescription is stronger than mine. We seem to be having lots of glasses conversations in the office recently!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2005, 15:02</p><p>There was a girl at school, she must have been about 11, suddenly she turned up at school wearing glasses full time from nothing. After that the the progression was only to about minus 4 or so. She was a bit a bitch so I never spoke to her more than necessary. She had nice elder sister who wore a similar prescription. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chris</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2005, 11:43</p><p>Np, whether or not people go full time with their glasses straight away probably depends on a number of things.  For presbyopia full time wear isn't needed, it shouldn't think it's all that uncommon for myopes to go full time straight away, afterall most of them will end up there eventually.  I guess it depends on the strenght on the original prescription and/or how much the individual likes/doesn't like the idea of wearing glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I had quite a strong first rx, I'd know I'd needed glasses for quite a while but never got round to going to the opticians, it was only when I couldn't cope with the blur anymore that I eventually got glasses.  I was pretty much full time from the start, once I'd got the glasses I always wore them outside the house, for the first few days I didn't always have them on at home, but within a few days I put them on first thing in the morning. </p><p> </p><p>Interestingly, I've got an eyetest booked for Friday, things are starting to look a bit blurry again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2005, 06:31</p><p>Np - I can't comment on just how typical it is but it probably happens frequently enough. I remember one of my ex boyfriends got glasses at 21 and he went fulltime straight away. I didn't know anything about vision at the time but remember that they weren't too strong. Now, some 15 years later, we still bump into each other and I'd guess his rx is no more than -3, but not much more. Are you thinking you'll go fulltime? What's your rx?</p><p></p><hr>

Its quick(or not so quick)easy(if motivated) and cheap(just need some inexpensive guide books) and some say you can eliminate your myopia alltogether.

You could probably reduce your -3 to -1.5 then youd never need glasses again except to drive. I could reduce my -5.5 to -4 or even -3 then be much less dependant on glasses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://eyescene.net/cgi-bin/read_thread.cgi?42" target="_blank">http://eyescene.net/cgi-bin/read_thread.cgi?42</a> </p><p> </p><p>There is the topic in this forum in the above link but no one seems to post there. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>presbyopia_23</b>&nbsp;16 Jul 2005, 03:33</p><p>The most annoying thing about glasses is the lenses always have some dust on them. I have learned to ignore particles of dust too small to interfer with my vision. Larger particles of dust I try to blow off but this doesnt always work then I end up wiping it with my shirt and this causes it to smear more. The only way to make them completely clean is use a damp papertowel then a dry papertowel to wipe it clean. Dust just gets back on the lenses in no time and clings to it due to static electricty.  </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://eyes.bunbury.ws/pages/anti-reflection2.JPG" target="_blank">http://eyes.bunbury.ws/pages/anti-reflection2.JPG</a> </p><p> </p><p>The lenses reflect and this bothers me. The left has antireflection coating which helps a little but my dad says its a gimmic thatll set you back $50-80 or so and youll still get much of the glare anyway.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>There is also the issue of minification. While not a serious problem in my pescription, it nonetheless still is there. Contacts fix this problem, the dust problem and some of the glare but they dry my eyes out and when my eyes are dry I am constantly aware of their presence. </p><p> </p><p>As for lasik I have been thinking about it since I first heard about lasik almost 10 years ago, I was like 14 or so and I was thinking I should get it when I turn 18. I read tons about lasik and became very aware of its risks too. I got an evaluation a few months ago. My pupils can dilate to 8mm, maybe even 9mm. I have mild dry eyes and cant tolerate contacts very well for very long. Finally I have some presbyopia(hence my screename) I say I have about 2.5-3 diopters of accomodation which is still some but less than normal. With my full power -5 glasses on things from less than about 15 inches start becomming blurry. Even from 2 feet my eyes get tired quickly and have a dull ache. I would just need reading glasses after lasik. I mean I could read ok without them(with my contacts in) but its not as clear and makes my eyes tired </p><p>so I always read without any correction.  </p><p> </p><p>You have it easy being -3 your dependancy on glasses is alot less than mine. You dont need them for eating, reading or using the computer(if you sit a little closer) and you probably dont need them around the house either unless you watch TV. You are probably 20/200, I am 20/600! Youd be able to see the clock when you wake, although a bit blurry. I can barely see mine! You can go to the restroom or eat a snack without taking your glasses with you, I usually take mine with me. You can read from 1/3 meter or 13 inches fine, I have to stick my face in fairly close.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;14 Jul 2005, 12:33</p><p>Hi Ella </p><p>Did you feel annoyed when your MD made that comment? I had a comment made like that when I was in the gym a couple of months ago and it really hacked me off!! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ella</b>&nbsp;14 Jul 2005, 11:23</p><p>presbyopia_23, </p><p>Why don't you like your glasses? I never had a problem with mine whilst I was at uni, so many people wore them and it just wasn't an issue. Its only since I started work I've become more shy about them. I've come to realise over the past few days just how much I was missing not wearing them for work. Even the computer screen is slightly blurred without them now, which I hadn't really noticed before.  </p><p>As you said, I can definitely get around without glasses, but its quite difficult, because stuff like not seeing peoples faces, or being able to read notices on the wall, is actually fairly annoying. I'm very glad I've started to wear them now, and the comments have virtually stopped. the only one I got today was from the managing director of our firm, who said, I noticed you've been wearing your specs this week, you certainly look better than when you used to squint across the office. I hadn't even realised I was, but if I don't do it anymore, thats another bonus to wearing them!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>presbyopia_23</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2005, 22:52</p><p>Ella, I also dont like glasses but being -5.25 my uncorrected vision is like 20/600!

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2005, 10:22</p><p>Ella - brilliant! I know that feeling of wanting to whip them off - I actually did that once - my neighbour called me from over the fence and I whipped them off before I looked over! I bet you're glad you've got it over with :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ella</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2005, 10:16</p><p>Hi </p><p>I posted here recently about not feeling I was able to wear my glasses to work. I went to the opticians last week to get my eyes tested and pick some new frames. My prescription only changed a bit, its now -3 and -3.50, and -0.50 astigmatism. The optician was quite suprised when I turned up straight from work not wearing them. he told me he thought I really ought to wear them all the time, he said his prescription was less than mine and he did. After the test I picked out a frame, its brown and plastic and I liked the way it looked on me, although its quite a bold choice I felt! When I picked them up the next day after work, I kept them on all the way home and all that night. I even forced myself to keep them on when a friend came round later, but she is an old university friend and used to seeing me in glasses.  </p><p>I've worn them for work all week as well! I did as you said and just kept them on. Really wanted to whip them off just as I was walking into the office but then I remembered clear vision, and kept them on. There were actually lots of comments! About 4 or 5 of the girls I work with asked if I didn't have my contacts in, as lots of people seem to wear contacts in my office. My boss actually commented that I looked very studious! Which annoyed me, as I hope they don't make me look like that!  </p><p>I'm not really worried about anyone else seeing me in them as my friends from university and school, and my family, are used to seeing me in them. </p><p>Just realised I've rambled on quite a bit, but I want to say thankyou to everyone who encouraged me to wear them!</p><p></p><hr>

We know a young girl from Taiwan who wears -15 glasses and has contact lenses to bring her sight up to where she can see - her total Rx is around an amazing -24/25 but she manages somehow! </p><p>Myopia in the Far East has reached epidemic proportions now and there is alarm in governments that blindness is going to affect more people there.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-5.00 who luvs gwgs</b>&nbsp;09 Jul 2005, 06:18</p><p>Not sure whether this is the right thread but I was talking to a Hong Kong optician about percentages with myopia He said about 80% of students in HK have myopia normally -2.00 or -3.00 up from -1.00 or -2.00 20 years ago he also said a very common prescription is -4.00 much more than -5.00 is less common From my sightings I would agree from my recent trip only 1 or 2 girls above about -6.00 (see sightings) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>presbyopia_23</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2005, 12:05</p><p>Katy......astigmistim isnt the same as myopia and does not add onto myopia. -4.5 is -4.5 reguardless of anything else. The two are seperate so he would be a moderate myope and have moderate astigmistim. His uncorrected vision would probably be like 20/600 or so. I dont even consider plus or minus quarter or half diopter as myopia or hyperopia as its so slight, its clinically insignificent.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>glinthia, this is puzzling and not good. always being 20/40 best corrected is one thing, being 20/20 when you were young and only 20/40 now calls for investigation. I hope you dont have any eye diseases or ectasia. If not then I would blame your astigmistim. Glasses often can not fully correct this, especially if its the irregular kind. If your BCVA gets worse where you cant legally drive you might consider RGP to try to give you some lines back. Wavefront lasik might be an option but you must talk to your optamologist about this, I am not qualified to give any advice on that, not a doctor. As for me, I have gotten my topographies which showed irregular astigmistim, more so in the right eye. With my full power glasses I only see 20/40 in the right, 20/30 in the left. With both I can kinda make out a few of the 20/25 letters. I consider myself 20/30+ with both eyes open. My optometrist said most people wont get 20/20 vision and your BCVA depends on your shape and what the eye allows. Some only get 20/100 WITH correction, others are very lucky and get 20/15! 20/30 or 20/40 honestly isnt bad and good for everything, even driving! I just hope your BCVA doesnt get worse. </p><p> </p><p>as for you contact wearers, dont let anyone else wear yours, it leds to infection! You may try someones glasses as they never touch your eye directly. I dont usually wear contacts since my eyes too are senestive and contacts dry and irriate them after a couple hours. I wish I didnt need any correction but being in the -5 range this isnt even close to possible. I need 20/600 to positivately see the letter and 20/400 is very difficult. Maybe if I was -2.5 or so and could see 20/200 without too much trouble I might not need glasses-much </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2005, 15:53</p><p>I have been reading about the different categories that they put myopia in, which seem to be mild (-0.5 to -3), moderate (-3 to -6) and severe (over -6). The thing is, does anyone know whether they look at the rx with plus or minus cyl for this? A friend of mine has -4.5 with -2 cyl, so written with plus cyl he would have -6.5/+2 - and be counted as severe, which would mean a higher risk for eye problems.  </p><p> </p><p>Also, I know there has been a discussion about Singapore on another thread, but does anyone have an idea of how common different minus rxs are in the UK or USA? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>irishgal</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2005, 10:59</p><p>Ella, I know how you feel, I was like that  when I first started college.  In school it was ok as people were used to seeing me  in glasses... but at college I wore contacts each day for the first few weeks so the first time I wore my glasses it was a little daunting... but in the end it was ok. I did have a few comments, but I just explained I usually wore contacts, and no more was said... though some people did want to try them on, which lead to a few comments regarding their strenth which made me feel a little embarassed.  (I'm -6.5, -7.25).  But after a short while people didnt say anything.  You said you'd worn yours once for a presentation, so I'm sure  people noticed them then, so my guess is that people are expecting to see you wearing them again soon, so perhaps they wont say too much!! I've rambled a bit here but I guess what I'm trying to say is to just to go for it, it wont be as bad as you think! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2005, 09:50</p><p>Ella,  </p><p> </p><p>In my experience, the only trick is to force full-time wear for a couple weeks or more.  At some point during this time, you'll most likely start to 'feel' like wearing glasses isn't such a big deal.  Until you wear them full time, though, it's easy to stay embarrassed about them for years, even decades...even though it doesn't take long to get over it. </p><p> </p><p>Katy's recommendation is a good one: go shopping for a pair of glasses that you really like.  Be patient, go to as many shops as it takes.  You'll find a pair that make you look just as good or better than you do without glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Some other things that can be encouraging:  *Work is the perfect place to wear glasses.  Most people inherently think glasses-wearers are smarter.  It's a good way for a young woman to get a little extra respect.   *There's nothing odd about showing up in glasses all of a sudden; just say your contacts were being uncomfortable...it's true, and it happens to almost every contact lens wearer at some point, and the majority of young professionals are nearsighted.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2005, 04:05</p><p>Ella - I know how you feel, I used to be exactly the same. I felt like once I had met someone without my glasses, it was too late. But the thing is, it really isn't that bad when you actually do it - thinking about it is much worse. If you wear them to work, you will probably get a couple of comments in the first ten minutes, and that will be it. You will probably feel shy for the first day, but not after that - and it is really worth one day of shyness to be able to wear them and see! Nobody really takes much notice, which is hard to believe, when wearing them feels like such a huge thing.  </p><p> </p><p>What really helped me was getting some new frames before I started wearing them - I got some I liked and that made me feel more confident. And whenever anyone said anything, which wasn't very often, I just said I had had them for ages, and no-one asked anything else. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2005, 01:03</p><p>Ella, I'm more than twice your age and have felt like you do since university days! For me it has hardly got easier.  I'm still too embarrassed to wear at work except when absolutely essential (only a couple of times in more than 20 years!), though  I do wear a bit more outside at weekends now. And, of course, I have to wear when driving or at the cinema or theatre. Some people seem to overcome their shyness; others don't. I don't think I ever will. Amd maybe it's worse for me as I've never had contacts: don't think I could cope with them.  Good luck.</p><p></p><hr>

I now have a lovely gf mentioned in previous posts who is -6.50 in her worst eye she is about to get her first bifocals so will doubtlessly look even sexier.Yes she has proudly worn her glasses fulltime since she first had them at age 11 no contacts for thank goodness.So I would say to everybody go for fulltime wear if you are anything over about -2.00 hardly any one apart from ES members will notice. </p><p></p><hr>

I find that I do best if I haven't worn glasses for a while so, as you use contacts, you might find things blurrier (is there such a word?) than me when you wear neither glasses nor contacts.  We just must meet: we've got such a common interest. We can have a contest as to which of us can see least across that coffee-shop. Bet it would be a close run thing. Text me-07871436620.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2005, 13:07</p><p>Hi Phil </p><p>You said "If your rx goes up a bit you may just have to wear them a little more". Hey, I don't see you setting the great example there! What does 'a little more' mean in terms of the difference between my 'now' and that? </p><p> </p><p>Sorry, I'm teasing you big time. I am curious how you get by though - when I'm tired I dread putting contacts in, this morning the sun was shining, I wore my sunglasses and am used to having some spare contacts in my drawer at work. But work is new, I haven't left any contacts in my drawer! Result - I've struggled with recognising people as they approach me, acted dumb when someone gesticulated across the office for something, and sat in a presentation that I couldn't see. How do you do it? !!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2005, 13:03</p><p>Einar - that's such a sad story. I hoped for a different result!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Einar</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2005, 06:01</p><p>Hi Clare and Phil,  </p><p>(sorry, my english is bad) </p><p>... a date ... many years ago ... </p><p>I (22 and very shy) met a girl (21 and also shy). </p><p>She never wore her glasses ( -3.5 or so) and so did I (-4.25, -4.5). </p><p>We knew our problem and we were sure to talk about and to wear our glasses. </p><p>My glasses were in my jacket.

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2005, 01:48</p><p>Clare, I'm still shy, even at weekends! As you say it never really goes away.  But supermarkets etc. were getting dodgy!  And as I have to wear them driving there I have started keeping them on sometimes.  So I'm no braver than you.  If your rx goes up a bit you may just have to wear them a little more.  Luckily mine seems to have stabilised. I don't think I'll ever go fulltime. I think you are wrong about how we'd be if we met: each would know the other's thoughts and we'd just giggle. If you are ever in SW1 I'll buy you a coffee and we'll find out!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>George1968</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2005, 16:45</p><p>Clare, </p><p> </p><p>I don't think myopia just goes away.  Yours started later than most, but I am sure that it either stabilizes or gets worse, not get better.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2005, 14:47</p><p>Isn't it strange? I never craved glasses, in fact I'd never thought about them and any friends who got them had no impact on me. Yours was a fair prescription wasn't it for a first one? Mine was -0.75 and I really questioned why it'd even been prescribed. Perhaps if I'd ignored it, it would have gone away, or at least stayed the same. But there's no point in that train of thought now. </p><p>I still think you're 'brave' enough (if that's the right term) to wear glasses outside of work, so that's a start. I'm sure at -3.5 you must sometimes wish you could just put them on!! And if two people like us met? I think the one like me would still be reticent, maybe forever like it ...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2005, 01:00</p><p>I can't explain any of it Clare.  It's deep in my past. I can remember wanting glasses when I was 9 or 10, and trying to get them when I was 18 (and failing because my rx was "too low" and the optician wanted his lunch!). Then being so pleased three years later when I had progressed to -2 while at Oxford: the optician there was astounded I wasn't already wearing fulltime! Told me I must. I put my first pair on in his shop, then took them off as soon as I got outside! And there the shyness began: none of my college friends knew I needed glasses: most of them still don't! What do you think would happen if two people with "our" problem knew they were going to meet?  My suspicion is that they would both wear their glasses for the encounter and not feel a spot of shyness.</p><p></p><hr>

You bring a good point and im thankful for the 20/70 requirement. I think 20/40 is too strict and not neccessary. Sure you might not be able to see street signs from like a mile away you 20/20 guys enjoy but 20/70 doesnt make you an unsafe driver. Many people either dont drive or drive illegally because their uncorrected or best corrected vision is worse than 20/40. One lady who had bad results in lasik only achieved 20/60 uncorrected and glasses couldnt help past that. Her uncorrected vision improved tremendously but she lost a couple lines best corrected. I dont know what will happen when the time comes to renew her license :( anyway my bro is -1.5 and -2.0 so hes 20/60 and 20/80 in his eyes. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Presbyopia_23 - I have -2.75 contacts and -2.75 glasses.

If you can even read with your contacts in without alot of blurriness or difficulity then you can accomodate better than this 23 year old presbyope. I can accomodate 2.75 diopters which is like half as much as what other 23 year olds can do. I take my glasses off to read or read from half a meter with glasses on(which I probably shouldnt, thats 2+ diopters accomodation and bad for my eyes) so I make it a practice to never read or eat with my glasses and I use weaker computer glasses thats supposed to undercorrect me by 1.5. I cant get lasik or id need reading glasses for anything less than a meter :( </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>presbyopia_23</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2005, 03:59</p><p>I calculate contacts vs. glasses by taking the contact pescription and multiplying by 1.25 to get glasses or multiply by .8 to get contacts. Therefore -1 contacts equals -1.25 glasses, -2 equals -2.5 glasses, etc. I have tested this myself and my simple formula agrees with me. I have a few contact prescriptions I got as samples ;) and my optomologist measured my glasses pescription as -5 well I see just as well with the -4 multifocal contacts I tried. The -3.5s I tried are slightly clearer than my old -4 glasses. The results I ask of others also seem consistant, one lady sees better with her -3 contacts than -3 glasses, I told her she needs -3.75 glasses. My sister wears -2.75 contacts and can barely see the 20/200 E uncorrected. This is about -3.5 in glasses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>As for lasik on someone -.5 or even -1 thats just dumb. You are taking a risk on your eyes with such low myopia that wont even limit you! I think lasik or any surgury on someone who can legally drive without correction is a big NO-NO! This generally covers anyone less than -1 to -1.5 diopters. I would be hesisant to even mention lasik if you are not over -2 diopters. My brother is -1.5 and -2 for 20/60 and 20/80 but his myopia is quite low that he doesnt really bother with glasses except for driving(not that he even needs glasses to drive, just good measure) Over here in Florida you gotta be 20/70 to legally drive.  </p><p> </p><p>Lasik doctors and centers just want your $ so yes ive seen some -1 get lasered and frankly any complications they get is their own fault for being so vain about a very, very slight blur. I really think lasik should be reserved for those with over -3 diopters and/or moderate astigmistim. Get intacs if you are -3.5 or less, at least those can be removed for any reason</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Luke</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2005, 07:36</p><p>I think the phrase would have been "obviously more dollars than sense".  ;) </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, in the lasik-ed person's defense, low prescriptions usually yield very good results.  If the person wasn't very old, they could have a long period of very good uncorrected vision instead of sort of mediocre uncorrected vision; I don't really think Lasik was any less indicated in this situation than for a person with -3 or -5. </p><p> </p><p>"In-tacs" corneal rings were supposed to be aimed at people in this Rx range, and would have been a better solution, I think - since they can be removed and provide excellent results for people with low Rx's.  I think the company that makes them went out of business, though, since I think Lasik has a lot more marketing money and momentum behind it. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, too bad for the goal of having more people wear glasses.

For example with -1.5 glasses is it generally accepted that -1.25 contact will be suitable?

<p><b>presbyopia_23</b>&nbsp;31 May 2005, 00:49</p><p>Puffin, someone whos 20/40 might not even know hes slightly myopic unless he compares his vision with someone else using a chart or a game of "who can see the furthest" Sometimes they complain they cant see the chalkboard from the back of class and ask to get closer. He may think everyone sees as good/bad as he does. My first pescription was -1 and I didnt relize this till I made my own vision chart with a pencil for fun. I remember doing this as bragging rights how good my vision was and I said I could see halfway down the bottom and told my bro if he can see as far down as he. To my supprise he saw two lines lower than me. I asked how is that possible? He said he really focused on the letters and squinted a bit. I was like ah I didnt put the effort you did. I guess things led themselves and my dad thought I might be a "little off" I was like no way but dad said he can see twice as far with his glasses as I could uncorrected(I was tested as 20/50) and got my -1 pair and ever since my vision slowly got worse. I probably overwore my glasses, if not id be alot less than the -5.5(improved to -4.75) I am now.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>as for that ebay auction, ebay musta pulled it. I guess thats something your not allowed to sell(no pescription, wasnt a optometrist) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"-0.5 cls correspond to -0.75, which isn't negligable if you're driving or trying to read the subtitles on a film - it means that everything past eight feet or so is a mild blur." </p><p> </p><p>-.5 contacts are equal to .63 glasses(but none are made like that just by .25s) but this is still a very mild myope. Probably 20/30 without astigmistim. Youd gain at least a line, possibily two if you dont have other problems besides simple myopia. Driving is not an excuse, 49 states give you an unrestricted license for 20/40 with many allowing 20/50 or even worse to drive. Only one state is very strict-20/30! I dont think being 20/30 would impair you unless you wanted to be a pilot or an occupation that requires 20/20 I honestly wouldnt bother with contacts or glasses if I was 20/40 or better. In fact doing so would just make your eyes worse like it did for me and most.  </p><p> </p><p>I have seen plano contacts, but those type are bifocal, multifocal or to change the color of your eye. Ive seen quarter diopter(both plus and minus) pescription contacts which is just silly in my opinion. For low hyperopes they can see just fine from far(nonwithstanding presbyopia) and young hyperopes, if mild can accomodate enough to see from near too. Low myopes also shouldnt bother with correction, if they do, just to drive or something</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Daffy</b>&nbsp;26 May 2005, 19:24</p><p>I agree. The term 'computer glasses' is really a 'cop out' to say that you need reading glasses. Sure it will assist in vision for computer use. But they will also have them on while working around the PC. Before long, they will realize that it's just easier to read with them on and end up needing them for any close work. It just takes time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;12 May 2005, 12:10</p><p>Another guest - I don't know the actual answer but as there are lots of bespectacled policemen wandering around I imagine it's less of an issue than it used to be. I think they changed their entry requirements on height a few years back so why not this one too? As to what happens if your vision deteriorates, I'd imagine they'd move you to a desk job. That's kind of standard practice I think in jobs in our institutions like the forces I think. I've been out with a couple of policemen and it's very similar in outlook.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;10 May 2005, 06:26</p><p>also - does anybody know what the consequence is if, on entering the police force or fire brigade, you have perfect 20/20 vision and then your eyesight deteriorates? Do you get kicked out of the force?!!!! Lol - surely this deteriotation in eyesight is relatively common?!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Another Guest!</b>&nbsp;10 May 2005, 06:21</p><p>I was just, as a matter of interest, looking up the police recruitment homepage and looking at what visual acuity is required. It says that uncorrected vision should be no more then 6/36 - what does this equate to in diopters? and is this correct? This doesnt seem to be very high to me and I guess about half the population have vision like this or worse - besides i am sure i know of police officers and have seen police officers with much higher prescriptions then this. I am around the -2 mark so, if I was interested in applying, would 6/36 unaided vision be unattainable?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;08 May 2005, 13:17</p><p>-10 sph, -5cyl x 1 is close to a prescription of ï¿½12,50 sph. Itï¿½s not the same vision because  -5 cyl  is strong.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 May 2005, 10:30</p><p>It isn't the 1 degree that will make a difference, but the fact  that 5 dioptres of the Rx are cylinder and not sphere. I"d say his vision will be as bad as someone's with -15, but he won't see well with -15 glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Matthew</b>&nbsp;29 Apr 2005, 09:18</p><p>Guest -- It depends.  Someone who is completely blind could carry on a conversation across a table.  Someone with, say, -6 wouldn't be able to see you clearly at all across a table, but could probably look at you as if he were making eye contact.  "Comfort" is totally dependent on the person - some people can't stand the slightest blur (which, at 4 feet away probably happens between -1.5 and -2) while others wouldn't mind conversing in a fog of -20.  But I think between -3 and -5, someone across a table is really quite blurry; might be fine with a friend, but probably awkward with someone you don't really know well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob W.</b>&nbsp;26 Apr 2005, 20:47</p><p>Hi all! </p><p>I don't know if anyone noticed in BBC online 4/12, Smart lenses to halt short sight, an article describes a study at Anglia Polytechnic University, Cambridge. </p><p>Apparently, they're taking in myopes from 14 to 21 years old, fitting them with these lenses, and then watching to see what happens over the next 3 years or so. They will track progression of their Rx. I got curious (SUrprise!!) and I think they are fitting progressive or bifocal contact lenses, or just regular single vision Rx, so see if "readers" slow up the progression any. This is based of studies that myopes have some difficulty accomodating compared to others, although this only shows up when they first become clinically myopic. A couple of recent studies seem to show that bifocals help slow progression. </p><p>If anyone is curious about the current state of research in Myopia world, consider this link: </p><p><a href="http://web.apu.ac.uk/appsci/optometry/myopiaconference/10th%20IMC%20abstract%20book.pdf" target="_blank">http://web.apu.ac.uk/appsci/optometry/myopiaconference/10th%20IMC%20abstract%20book.pdf</a> </p><p>This is the abridged proceedings of the 10th International Myopia Conference in Cambridge. It contains very short abstracts of many research papers, and is not casual reading. Just glancing through it though, will give you an idea of where things are headed. If certain animal species have vision hampered in early developement, their eyes grow too long. Acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, is believed to be part of this. 1 line of research lead to using Atropine (Acetylcholine Blocker), or something similar, as drops multiple times per day, with some slowing of Rx progression. Another line is that accomodation difficulties might drive Rx progression, therefore, try to assist with bifocals. 2 controlled studies showed that undercorrecting children by 0.75 Diopters led to increased Rx progression to the point that the studies were ended in 2 years instead of 3. In all of these studies, the length of the eye, behind the lens, called the 'posterior chamber' elongates in proportion to the change in Rx. </p><p>I wonder where this leaves bare-eyed wanderers? That could leave those like me in a real jam! The only way out that I can think of is considering straining, ie., the amount of effort made in trying to focus. Maybe strained attempts at focusing are more malignant than relaxed blur? This is the APU blurb about the study: </p><p><a href="http://web.apu.ac.uk/appsci/optometry/pressrelease.htm" target="_blank">http://web.apu.ac.uk/appsci/optometry/pressrelease.htm</a> </p><p>Cheers, or whatever. </p><p>Best Regards, Bob W. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mike</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2005, 06:41</p><p>I suppose that near-sightedness is simply an unavoidable consequence of working in this industry. You can take precautions to minimize eyestrain, like using a good LCD monitor and taking frequent breaks, but ultimately, if you are sitting in front of a computer all day, you're probably going to become near-sighted sooner or later. </p><p>Truthfully, I probably should have gotten an eye exam two or three years ago, but simply kept putting it off.  </p><p>Anyways, the moment I put on the glasses, the difference was startling. You really don't appreciate all of the crisp, subtle details of the world around you that you are not seeing, until you finally make the comparison.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2005, 15:45</p><p>A few years ago (ok, maybe a decade ago) I could see well at distance thru most weak to moderate minus lenses - up to maybe about -3 or -4, even up to -7 if I tried for a while (tho it was a real strain, and the minimisation was very apparent. </p><p> </p><p>Now that age has made me respect my piddling hyperopia &amp; mild astigmatism, even -1 is apparent to me, and quite impossible for near!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Horsey</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2005, 15:05</p><p>Thanks for your views Andrew - I am now a -2.50 and usually where contacts but have tried my glasses on over my contacts - do you think this vision is what somebody with 20/20 vision would see through my glasses?

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2005, 14:45</p><p>Horsey, </p><p> </p><p>I'm not sure there's an accurate answer to your question - it depends on the person trying the glasses on.   Some people will declare even the mildest prescription "far too strong", in the same way as some people will say they are "blind" without their glasses, which are a -1 prescription.   Then you need to add in the fact that the "trier-on" may need a mild prescription themselves, which will produce different results. </p><p> </p><p>Not a helpful answer, maybe, but accurate, I hope.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Horsey</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2005, 13:38</p><p>What RX do you think it takes for a plano to begin not to see clearly through? When I started off with glasses they were something like -0.75 and when friends etc tried them on they said 'there's no difference - are these clear glass? - since then my prescription has increased my firneds now say they cant see anything through them - but I'm interested to know when this clear image turns into a blur?!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jarred</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2005, 09:48</p><p>Hi Matt, Thanks for your observations on the side vision with the varifocals, its interesting. I was wondering if mine had a flaw in them but it sounds like its the norm. My need for the multifocal is to control acomodative esotropia, I've been wearing either reading glasses or bifocals since I was about ten. I think my preference is for the quality if vision over what the glasses look like to anyone else, with the prism in my prescription my lenses are about 10mm thick at the edges so who am I kidding! But its interesting to hear your observations. </p><p>J</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mattp</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2005, 09:23</p><p>Jarred-- </p><p> </p><p>Your description of looking at the computer screen through the progressives is exactly what I experience--to see the edges of the screen clearly, I must turn my head slightly.  Driving is also somewhat problematic--things in the outside rear view mirrors are blurred as are instruments like radio controls in the center of the dashboard.  I've not had a problem with things to the sides of the car, though--I guess I've probably always turned my head rather than looking out the sides of my glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Again, I do think the trifocals do give me better vision.  Having just turned fifty, vanity is my motivation here.  I have gotten used to the progressives, and there are no lines!! </p><p> </p><p>Matt</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2005, 09:10</p><p>Jarred </p><p> </p><p>I have HOYA progressives and I love them. I have a +3 add with 2BO prisms.  Not all progressives are equal with some being better than others. With my RX (-14) peripheral vision has always been iffy but the Hoyas seem to be as good as my older single vision lenses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jarred</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2005, 07:03</p><p>Hi Matt, I suppose one of the problems I have is I dont know what level of periferal vision is to be expected with progressive lenses? With these ones I have just got, if Im looking at the centre of my monitor and cast my gaze to the left and right sides of the screen its out of focus. To me this seems quite limited. Driving is ..... well interesting as well!!! </p><p> </p><p>J </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mattp</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2005, 06:20</p><p>Jarred-- </p><p> </p><p>That awful peripheral vision in progressives is a problem.  For years I wore bifocals and then trifocals because I could not get used to the blur on the sides of my vision.  For three months now, I have forced myself to wear progressives--and I have gotten used to it.  And the progressive vision in the center is nice.  Good luck!! </p><p> </p><p>Matt</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2005, 14:34</p><p>Jake, </p><p>In answer to your question about the extra line of letters, it is probably just that - an extra set of letters.   If you have to read / try to read the same set of letters too often during an eye exam, you think you can just about read them, when actually, you cannot really.   By having alternative sets of letters for you to read, they can tell whether you can really read them, or are just remembering them from 30 seconds earlier when you actually could read them!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jarred</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2005, 07:46</p><p>Hi All, I collected my new glasses today with my revised prescription. R+1.50 -1.75 105 5.50 Base Out L+1.50 -1.75 65 5.50 base out I have +2.00 of add and the prisms to control acomodative esotropia. I was told that varifocals would be better for me than the bifocals I have used for years ... but the peripheral vision is appalling! All but the very centre of the lens is useful both distant and close. Is this normal? They are Nikon lenses which have taken them over a month to make up so you would think they are reasonable quality. The other thing I have found is that the high index material creates even more chromatic abberations. I will give myself a few days to TRY and get used to them but at the moment its not looking good. Has anyone else noticed these problems with hi index and varifocals ......and found a solution? The clear focus (in the middle) at all distances is nice!! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2005, 00:50</p><p>My astigmatism is -1.75, -1.25 (sphere +0.25) and while not impossible reading and computer work without glasses is very uncomfortable.  Daytime driving isn't a problem but I wouldn't drive at night without them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2005, 00:01</p><p>My cyl is -2.00 and -2.50. That's more than my sph correction, which is -2.25 and -1.75.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2005, 22:58</p><p>Agreed. My astigmatism is less than either of yours and it's still enough to be a nuisance. But it can be really high for some people.

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2005, 15:47</p><p>Well, Tuesday i got my new glasses. They weren't what i expected them to be like. When i went in to pick them out, i fell in love with these frames right away when i saw them on the rack. I had to have them. When i tried them on before ordering them, the receptionist said that they looked good on me, that is why i got these frames. That day there was only the receptionist there to help me pick out my new frames, the optician is only there 2 days a week, and my grandpa didn't want to help me pick them out. I must say that these frames are different from what i've ever had in the past. They are a limited Edition frame. The color of the frames is called brown crystal, and the name of the frame is Manhattan. The lenses are kinda a rectangular shape, only they are wider towards the outside of the frame, and more narrower towards the inside of the frame. The lenses are also high index plastic and about a 1/4 of an inch thick on the outer edges. I will get used to how they look on me, and please forgive me for complaining. At least i can see!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Richard</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2005, 14:13</p><p>I think John's theory is right - there's clinical evidence to back up the concept of 'almost myopia' leading to real myopia. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2005, 09:48</p><p>Bored -   </p><p> </p><p>  "Almost" nearsighted is an expression, pretty obvious I think, for someone whose refraction has gone from a low plus (say +0.5 to +1) to Zero or a very low minus (say -0.25).  "Almost nearsighted" in the sense that changing focus from near to far takes some time because of how completely the lens needs to relax, and also in the sense that it's likely the person is on their way to becoming nearsighted, even if they currently can see 20/20 in an exam.  If you're in this category, you're going to notice that it takes a few seconds to see clearly in the distance after looking at things up close, and this isn't something that used to happen to you.   This is not to say the hyperopia theory couldn't be correct, but the very-low-myopia theory does fit the symptoms.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2005, 18:38</p><p>I think "almost long sighted" means when you are long sighted but your accomodation is just about enough to cover up for the undercorrection of the natural lens.  </p><p> </p><p>Then either your accomodation ability goes down and it can't make up for the unchanged amount of hyperopia, or else the hyperopia gets worse and you're stuck the other way, and it's time to visit the optician.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bored</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2005, 15:10</p><p>John, what the heck does "almost" near-sighted mean.  Either you are or you are not.  Willy's right, he just doesn't know why.  She's has a small hyperopic Rx and is suffering from accommodative spasm. Andrew, I bet your friend did not have a cycloplegic refraction, almost all of those with symptoms of dist. blur following extended near work are hyperopic when cyclopleged.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hollie</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2005, 13:06</p><p>Kate </p><p>I had a similar thing about a year before I got glasses, switching from board to book was difficult.

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2005, 12:36</p><p>About a year ago, I would have said long-sighted, Kate, but someone I know was complaining of exactly the same sort of thing.   I managed to persuade her to get her eyes tested, and she came back with a prescription of -0.25 and -0.5; she got it filled as she was getting headaches from switching from near to far and back.   Result?   No more headaches.   She's about due for a check-up, I reckon, so it'll be interesting to see if/how her eyes have changed in the last year.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2005, 20:16</p><p>Kate -- Willy is probably wrong.  More likely, you are *almost* nearsighted.  This is a normal symptom of someone just before they become more noticably nearsighted.  (When you are a little farsighted, it's easier for the eyes to relax *enough* to see clearly in the distance.  When your eyes are just barely emmetropic, almost nearsighted, they have to relax ALL THE WAY in order to see clearly in the distance, and this can take a few seconds or even several minutes. </p><p> </p><p>Are you someone who would like to have to wear glasses, or someone who wouldn't?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Willy</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2005, 13:08</p><p>Kate -- Of course, another even more commmon symptom of hyperopia would be headache or eyestrain from reading.  If you have been experiencing that, then all of us here would certainly recommend an eye exam...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Willy</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2005, 13:03</p><p>Kate -- You would be farsighted rather than nearsighted; if you were nearsighted, you would not be able to focus on distant materials regardless of how long you looked at them.  From your post, it sounds like you are not at the age where presbyopia is hitting yet.  Time in changing focus from near to far can be a symptom of farsightedness, so it may make sense to get an exam.  If you do, let us know how it goes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kate</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2005, 12:14</p><p> I have been noticing that when I'm reading a book or looking at my notes in class and then looking up to the overhead or powerpoint screen, it takes a few seconds to focus, does that mean I'm nearsighted or farsighted?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Digger</b>&nbsp;02 Feb 2005, 11:15</p><p>Yes, one sphere and one cylinder is just an approximation.  I read somewhere about a scientist who built lenses to correct all of the refractive error of his eyes, which he measured with a laser.  When he tried them he had fantastic acuity, 20/10 or maybe 20/5, literally eagle-eyed. Must have been a strange sensation.  It would seem that the retina is not the limiting factor.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>big </b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2005, 08:53</p><p>Niall, I prefer the green and red test because for me it seems to be more accurate. I'm farsighted with moderate astigmatism. I'ts been awhile but if I remember right, as they add plus power the green gets clearer and the red gets out of focus, and just the opposite with minus. I asked the eye doctor and he said each color has a different wave length which your eyes focus on differently. If they use the clearest green reading you will leave with a higher plus power. It's hard to get some doctors to use this test because they get more complaints of too much plus power and they have to remake your glasses. I'm sure someone else here can explain this better than me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Niall</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2005, 05:58</p><p>Does anyone out there know what the circles using the green and red backgrounds in an eye test show? Sometimes when I go to the optician they only use the letter (snellen chart?) but others seem to be obsessed with using this green/red distinction!! Does it give a more accurate reading then the straightforward letters test and which one is suppose to be clearer becasue I can never tell the difference!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>fulltime wearer</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2005, 08:23</p><p>At first when I started wearing glasses fulltime, I was scared of what people would think. But I have some great frames and feel much better and more confident when I can see everything clearly. When I take them off I feel like you do when you have them on phil, quite awkward, because I think I must squint and just generally it irritates me not being about to see things really clearly. I guess it helps that my boyfriend loves me in glasses, he thinks they really suit me and knew I needed them before I got them because he would often have to point out things in the distance to me. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2005, 07:49</p><p>Yes Clare, exactly.  I would think that you looked great wearing yours but worried that I looked terrible wearing mine!  I do like to see clearly though.

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2005, 05:08</p><p>Phil I do agree with you about getting used to them and so not being able to go without. Can you explain the difference though between my vanity and your awkwardness/embarrassment? - aren't they a symptom of the same issue? I guess in the end what matters is how much clarity you need eh?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2005, 04:23</p><p>Clare, My rx is slightly higher than your new one (-3.5 and -3.25) and I don't wear full-time.  For me it's not vanity but more embarrassment or awkwardness.  We OOs make so much of glasses that we think that it is hugely significant whether we are wearing or not.  That is something the rest of the world just can't understand! I also think that once one does wear fulltime it must be harder to imagine what it is like not to (whatever one's rx).  If I wear for a whole day I just can't see anything when I take my specs off!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2005, 01:34</p><p>fulltime wearer - vanity I guess and a desire to put it off as long as possible. I'd never had any guidance from an optician before so I asked this time and he said that it would be helpful (!) to wear them for all distance activities. So the advice wasn't to wear fulltime but just often I think. I usually wear contacts, I just can't make that leap to wearing glasses all the time when I'm not. Hey, I get by!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>fulltime wearer</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2005, 01:15</p><p>Clare, I think my prescription card just says -2.25 under a box saying 'sph'. The 'cyl' box is empty.  </p><p>How come you don't wear fulltime?

Someone asked me if I wore glasses for my job, well I'm a student, and I definitely wear them for lectures. I also usually wear them for my tutorials, even though most of its close work, in case I can't make something out. But the rest of the time- pretty much no. Usually on the computer, but not usually for reading unless its small type/ my eyes are tired, because when I'm tired everything seems to be more blurry- is this normal? I put my glasses on at night if I'm not going anywhere just to relax my eyes. So, in fact, I guess I do wear them quite a bit!! Yesterday I went for lunch with them on, and when I was in the queue, noticed I could read the menu board from where I was standing and realised I had left my glasses on. One of my friends commented on them, and asked to try them (she wears glasses herself, just for distance, probably about -1 I would guess) and said she could see through them OK but they felt like they were 'pulling' her eyes. She is one of the first people I have come across that hasn't commented on the strength! Maybe that means she needs a stronger rx- she squints a fair bit at distant stuff I noticed, and often wears her glasses for the computer.  </p><p>Bespecatcled professor, how did you get to the -4 figure?

<p><b>Luke</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2005, 20:47</p><p>Clare - "other issues"...well, lots of things, probably, but an example (and probably a typical one) is that I somewhat frequently hesitate to go ask a colleague at work a question.  There will be something we are working on that I figure they know about.  I will figure that it is something I probably should already know, and I don't ask them because I don't want them to think badly of me.  Obviously, the productive approach is to ask; ignorance is combatted by learning, not by remaining ignorant.  But my silly fear gets in the way; it's largely the same as the glasses/vanity thing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andy</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2005, 14:42</p><p>Julian, I'm not really sure why I waited so long for a second eyetest.  I knew my eyes were getting worse and I did wear my older glasses more often, although most of the time I still went without.  For a few months before I knew that I should book an appointment to get new glasses, but for one reason or another I never got round to it.  It was only when I was about to be 17 and was going to start driving I finially got round to it.  Although I knew my vision was getting worse, I don't think I really noticed how much worse it had got.  It was only when I got my glasses and started wearing them I realised this.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2005, 13:23</p><p>Luke - you're right. I'd love to be liberated and confident enough to make that choice and disregard everyone else! If I'm tired sometimes the last thing I want to do is put in CLs and that's when I'll go without and put up with it. The optician said sometimes you may not want to wear them if you're tired or your eyes are dry, but I don't think that meant go without anything! That's okay when I'm just at my desk. </p><p> </p><p>Sounds like you made good progress though, so what are your issues?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2005, 13:06</p><p>My glasses are -7.75 and -7.50; my contacts are -6.25 (both eyes).   There will be a difference between the two, simply because of the distance the glasses are away from the eyes, but how great that difference is seems to vary.   I used to have contact lenses which were -7, and I was beginning to feel I needed readers to go with them.   I can now see perfectly well with the reduced power contacts, and have, I hope, put off the readers for a little while yet.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glfc</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2005, 07:45</p><p>Mary, your prescription is similiar to mine and your increase was similiar to my increase last summer. How old are you? I'm 19. My Rx is R:-5.25 L:-4.75 My Acuvue contacts I use to play sports are R:-5.00 and L-4.50. It probably depends on how well your vision is with your contacts. If you could see well with those contacts, then it's fine. </p><p> </p><p>Best, </p><p>glfc</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mary</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2005, 07:29</p><p>Oh yeah - forgot to mention! - I am going to get my prescription filled at Lenscrafters (Due to the fact that they have a 30-day return policy.). How can I tell if my prescription is slightly overcorrected (If it is!)?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mary</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2005, 07:20</p><p>I just got a new prescription: -5.25 in both eyes (no astigmatism). However, my contacts prescription is -4.50 in both. My previous glasses prescription was -4.25 in both eyes, while my contact prescription was -4.00. </p><p> </p><p>I have yet to get my glasses prescription filled. Does this contrast in diopters, between glasses and contacts, seem a bit much? I've never had more than -.25 difference between glasses and contacts. My vision, with the contacts, seems perfectly fine. I also switched from Surevue to Acuvue Advance contacts, but would that make any difference?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Luke</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2005, 06:02</p><p>Clare, Hollie -- Having been a person who wore contacts for years and was always self-conscious about wearing glasses, but then made the switch to (almost) full-time wear, I have to admit that situations like yours do sort of pain me.  Because a month or so of full time wear pretty much allowed me to get over myself and grow up (that's how I see it for myself, looking back) a little.  I'm definitely a lot more free now...I actually have a choice whether to wear glasses or contacts.  I think that's the real point: if you're -3ish or more and you're not wearing correction most of the time, I think that means you do NOT feel like you have a choice -- you don't really feel free to make the choice that would be the most comfortable to you (because of what you think someone else might think - and there's no denying this is the case for you two, since you have no issue with wearing contacts all the time).  Don't get me wrong...while I got over my issues about wearing glasses, I know I have other issues that are similar (worrying about what people think, even though I shouldn't care).  I hope that as time goes on, I can get over those things too, but we'll see.  But I guess I can sympathize with B.P's over-aggressive attitude because the gain to be had by getting comfortable wearing glasses all the time (the gain: a *real* choice) is really quite substantial - and the process to get there is (potentially) pretty simple.  (Simple means 'not complex'; it does not necessarily mean 'easy'. I know.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2005, 13:58</p><p>Hollie what job do you do - do you find you really need them for work or do you already wear them there? Hope you get back into contacts soon. Best.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2005, 13:36</p><p>Some people here might groan as I enter this debate as I've  whinged on about it for ages. They key words here are 'manage' and 'choice' both imply a strong degree of subjective interpretation. It's only when personal safety is at risk that that choice should be removed. I could 'manage' okay, as long as I didn't drive, no doubt I'd get to where I needed to go - not comfortably maybe - but it certainly would be possible. Then again I might choose not to put up with it but to be 'sensible' and wear my glasses, that'd certainly be the best and easiest option. I admire people who can accept it on terms this simple, Hollie, Phil and I probably wish we could too!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>no name</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2005, 10:33</p><p>actually, PF makes a valid point about people who don't wear their glasses and constantly rely on thier friends to read or see things for them. I always respond politely and helpfully, but after a couple of times, I begin to resent it, just as I do when friends ask me to carry extra things for them because they assume I am stronger (I might be because I don't expect others to carry my load), or pay more because they think I am richer (I'm not, I'm just more careful with my money) After a couple of times I feel resentful that they have assumed that I should continually cater to thier needs.  </p><p> </p><p>Of course, they probably don't realise (or care) that I feel this way, they just laugh or say "I'm so blind" when I sugggest that they should get or wear glasses. Sorry, but it's true.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2005, 09:57</p><p>Bespectacled Professor. You are being far too hard on Hollie. Who are you to tell her what she "should" do?  Adoption of an affected title does not legitimise your inconsiderate tone. Do you not realise that for most of us here whether or not to wear glasses fulltime is a difficult decision, not necessarily to be determined only by reference to how well we can see without them?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bespectacled Professor</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2005, 09:46</p><p>Hollie, </p><p> </p><p>With your astigmatism, your prescription is effectively -4.  That's a strong prescription to go without glasses.  Look at what you have said in the last few days.  First, you say that you need to wear glasses for reading depending on the size type.  If you are nearsighted and have to wear your glasses for reading, then you should be wearing them fulltime. </p><p> </p><p>Second, you have to have people act as your eyes while you are out.  I'm sure your boyfriend (and other friends) point stuff out for you because they care for you.  On the other hand, they would be doing you more of a favor if they told you to put your glasses on. </p><p> </p><p>You say you are able to manage without your glasses.  I think you are just fooling yourself.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hollie</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2005, 07:31</p><p>Its not getting used to glasses I have a problem with- I've worn them for 5 years. And the only reason I'm wearing them now is because I can't wear contacts for about 6 months because I have a problem with my eyes.  </p><p>Clare, yes it is very annoying out and about- especially after getting used to having correction full-time when I wore contacts. I must admit that even I will put my glasses on when I go shopping- I have to get too close to the price tages for it to be practical without. I can imagine, since you're nealy at -3, that you have similar problems too. I usually manage on nights out- but then I will ask my boyfriend and friends where stuff is! Wearing glasses to go shopping is one thing, but i know I would never wear them on a night out- it feels wrong to wear them when I know I can manage without. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2005, 11:43</p><p>There are plenty of people who feel the same and I'm one of them. It's horrible when people make you feel embarrassed, I had that last week. Two occasions in fact on the same night - the first pointing to something in the garden, my friend said "you can see that can't you?", I said, honestly "no, not from here" and she made a comment, not meant unkindly though. Then later in the evening she was pointing out a large new family photo on the wall and I got up to take a closer look, my friend (who has 20/20 vision) said "you're eyesight must be bad". I know her well enough not to care really, her husband wears glasses and thinks his -1.75 is strong so she must be kind of used to it. </p><p>But Hollie, if you don't wear glasses even when you're out and about, you must find it pretty difficult? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2005, 09:18</p><p>Hollie, </p><p>It's pretty normal to be uncomfortable with glasses at first. I'm sure your boyfriend will gwet used to you in glasses (he might even really really like you in glasses, but doesn't want to appear too "eager" so he says he hopes you don't need to wear them all the time. At first its really odd to feel them and see them, but you get used to it! If you have pierced earrings, you can remember how wierd they felt at first! After a while your glasses will sort of feel like comfy slippers. Just wear them enough so that your eyes will be used to them and you can wear them without having to adapt to distance blur each time. </p><p> </p><p>Or get contacts if you prefer. or both.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bespectacled Professor</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2005, 08:36</p><p>Hollie, </p><p> </p><p>I understand your reluctance to wear glasses fulltime.  But, if your eyes are bothering you because you are not wearing them, then you should wear them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hollie</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2005, 07:00</p><p>Bespectacled professor </p><p> </p><p>My boyfriend wears glasses fulltime, so he can't be hypocritical about it I suppose. The only negative comment h has ever made is that they get in the way of my 'pretty eyes' so he prefers it when I wear contacts. To be honest, I don't wear specs around him that much unless we are watching a DVD or I'm driving.  </p><p>I'm not really sure why I don't want to go fulltime. Going back to my boyfriends dad, I was at their house last week, no correction, and he asked me what I thought of a new picture he had bought. I must have squinted to see it (it was pretty blurry) and he said, 'Put your specs on Hollie, honestly, its no good wandering around half-blind!' I was mortified, because his entire family was there, and it started a conversation about glasses, during which his dad took his glasses off and gave them to me, asking whether I could see now. I mumbled that I could, and his mum commented, 'You must have a strong prescription'. I said something about it not being very strong really and how I had left my glasses in the car, which seemed to end the embarrassing discussion. But, despite the embarrassment of that, that is the only time when I would feel more comfortable with my glasses on. most times, I feel much more comfortable bare-eyed. I think the whole not wanting to wear them fulltime thing is purely because I don't want to be seen to rely on glasses. With contacts, its a different story and no-one can see them in your eyes. I know its silly and vain, but I'm sure there must be other people who feel like this and not just me! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Neil</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2005, 14:36</p><p>Katy it's -3. U?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bespectacled Professor</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2005, 11:45</p><p>Hollie, </p><p> </p><p>I suspect you are realizing that despite your reluctance to wear glasses fulltime (when not wearing contacts) that your eyes are telling you something different.  Would your boyfriend have a negative reaction if you decided to go to fulltime wear?  Why do you think you are reluctant to go fulltime if everyone knows you wear glasses and that they already think the glasses are strong? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hollie</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2005, 02:46</p><p>A few people who are non-wearers have tried them on, but mostly people who have a weaker prescription than mine commenting that they're strong. I suspect it may be the astigmatism too which makes them seem strong. My boyfriends dad has a similar prescription to mine and when he tried my glasses on he couldn't believe I didn't wear them full-time as he said I must be 'blind' without them.  </p><p>I agree with you about the looking over the top of your frames thing though, everything seems to 'jump' back into focus. Its been difficut for me to go from fulltime wearing back to part-time as my eyes were very used to the correction. The astigmatism bothers me quite a bit- headaches from concentrating on things etc.  </p><p>Are you wearing your new glasses more Clare? Interestingly, when I got to -2.25 -0.75, the optician told me to wear full-time, I guess even with the atigmatism this is weaker than your prescription, so maybe all opticians think this type of rx is qute strong. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VisitBoy</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2005, 14:19</p><p>Interesting to read what Clare and Hollie have said about what is defined as strong. I'd have strong lenses by the Moorfields guy's definition, but I'd consider them mid-range. </p><p> </p><p>The opticians will try anything to get you to pay more for lenses, though. I wanted standard lenses - not high-index - but was told that "they'll look ugly". It's difficult then to differ, as you'd be saying, in effect "I want to buy an ugly product". Well I got my standard lenses and they look fab!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Neil</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2005, 09:58</p><p>My cousin is an optician. He encouraged me to make the change to full time wear. His view was that if you arent seeing as well as you should, glasses can cure the problem so why wouldn't you want to wear them. He said to me that whether you wear them or not you won't make your eyesight worse. I have to trust him on that one as after just two months i'm  struggling without them now. I don't have an issue with wearing them at all and hopefully people will get used to it in time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2005, 09:42</p><p>My eye exam has been rescheduled for January 14, 2005. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2005, 09:02</p><p>Surprised me too Hollie. It suprised me back in the summer, that's why I asked yesterday. I wonder whether the pros have a slightly different view? Those of us who visit this site though know that there are lots of people with higher scripts. Those people who say your glasses are strong, are they non-glasses wearers? When I went in for the CL check yesterday the new/old glasses were ready, the assistant suggested I put them on to try them; because I had contacts in though I got a sense of what they must be like for people with 20/20 vision who try them on. Everything's slightly out of focus! I guess if you're not used to that it comes as a bit of a shock. You must get a sense though of how strong they are if you look over the top? I can with -2.75 and your Rx is stronger than mine.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hollie</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2005, 07:07</p><p>Thats really interesting Clare. My prescription would be considered fairly strong in your opticians opinion, and other people who try on my glasses seem to think they are strong, but to me it doesn't seem that strong at all, if that makes any sense? </p><p>I mean, obviously I can tell the difference from when I was -0.75, but to me it doesn't seem as if my eyesight is horrendously bad, which several friends assume it must be after trying on my glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2005, 15:02</p><p>I went to collect my old glasses with the new prescription today (-2.75) and I asked in a general sense how much he thought I should wear them. I told him that when I went to Moorfields (Eye Hospital) back in the summer they said my vision was 'quite bad' without my glasses. I said that I didn't think it was, was it? He said he thought it was and that -2.75 was quite strong, which surprised me. He reckons that 0 to -1.75 is low, -2 to -3.75 is quite strong and over -4 strong. That surprised me. I told him that, when not wearing contacts, I'm inclined to go without except for driving and matters of personal safety and he patiently explained that he had to recommend that I should wear them for driving, tv, movies etc, that I don't need them around the house or for reading (he must know I already know that!) but he thought it would be a good idea to wear them when I was out, like walking down the street. Sure I understand what he means but concur with Andrew that it's possible to get about even if you don't.  </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, that was an interesting conversation and my old/new glasses look just great. I was so pleased with them I wore them to Sainsbury's. And I didn't see anyone I knew, at least to talk to.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2005, 14:12</p><p>"I'm -2.75 and would struggle in the outside world without them but could get by of course." </p><p> </p><p>I suspect you've hit the nail on the head, Mal.   When you are outside, it is more likely that the things you need to focus on are beyond arm's length.   Thus, it is helpful to wear some form of correction. </p><p> </p><p>Indoors, however, much of what we do is at much closer range, so it is possible to function without glasses in these circumstances.   At work, it rather depends on the type of work as to whether we need them or not, and those with uncomplicated journeys to work may not need them at all.   At -7.5, I could easily walk to the bus stop, catch the bus to the station (they all go to the station), and catch the train to London (I think there is only one train a day which does not go to London from the up platform) without any correction at all.   If my job involved entirely close work, I could do it, but it is rather uncomfortable holding paper so close to my nose that I can see it clearly.   It's a bit like sitting in the front row at the cinema, and you have to keep moving your head to see what's going on!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2005, 09:42</p><p>BB, thanks for your well wishes as far as my eye exam and vision are concerned.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-oo-</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2005, 09:15</p><p>I think that is quite common. I started wearing glasses most of the time (and always at work) when I started a new job - now when I see people from the old job, they don't comment on me wearing glasses at all, even though they've never seen me wear them before. </p><p> </p><p>Also, if your first glasses have any power to them, and you are older than student age, then people will generally assume that you have stopped using contacts for the time being. </p><p> </p><p>Whats fun is when people suddenly see you WITHOUT glasses, especially when you haven't worn them for very long. I got more comments the day I showed up without my (fairly new) glasses at the new job (it was snowing hard that morning) than I ever did from poeple who'd never seen me wear them before. </p><p> </p><p>However, if YOU bring it up, people usually are pretty eager to discuss the situation (I guess there are a lot of people out there who are either facinated by glasses, or secretly think they need them!) I've also found that when friends or co-workers show up suddenly wearing glasses and I make a small comment (like "cool glasses") I find that they really want to talk about it! Just never never say something like "You don't really need to wear those!" That is the worst possible thing to hear! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hollie</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2005, 08:44</p><p>I always thought when I first started wearing glasses, that most people would comment. But it turns out, hardly any did! I was quite surprised at this. Does this mirror other people's experiences, or have you more comments than me?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Elaine</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2005, 02:41</p><p>I went to my first eye test, not on my own accord, but because my mum dragged me after my teacher spoke to her. </p><p>I was 10 years old at the time, and knew I couldn't see properly cause I had problems seeing the board from the back of the class but I used to lie and tell my teacher I'd better sit in the front cause I was short and had to crane my neck to see behind the taller girls' heads.  Well finally I couldn't even see properly from the front row any more (my eyesight had really deteriorated) and I failed a maths test because all the problems I copied from the board were copied wrongly (I had worked them out correctly) and so my teacher spoke to my mum.  And off we went to the opticians.  And I was given a -4.75 prescription in both eyes!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2005, 01:27</p><p>Andy: you have me slightly puzzled. You got your first glasses at 15. You wore them part time for two years before going for another test - by which time your vision with them was worse than your unaided vision was when you first got them. Getting a new, and more than doubled, prescription, you have cheerfully, not to say enthusiastically, taken to full time wear. Why did you wait so long? You certainly aren't alone; I know other people tell the same kind of story. And, by the way, what made you go for a test and get glasses in the first place? I only ask because I want to know!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Neil</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2005, 22:50</p><p>I used to hate the comments people made. You must be able to see that/your eyes must be bad/can't you see it? You get comments when you go full time but at least the comments stop then.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2005, 11:29</p><p>Sounds like there are lots more people out there like me after all! Can't say that if I couldn't wear contacts that I'd never wear glasses though.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2005, 05:52</p><p>Phil, Ive never, that I can recall, avoided driving / sport etc through not wearing correction.

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2005, 05:29</p><p>Mal, </p><p>I don't ever wear in the house: don't know why.  Means I can't really see tv but otherwise ok. Wear out at weekends but not often at work. Bit of an embarrassment thing: can't really explain it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mal</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2005, 04:07</p><p>Maverick do you mean that you've avoided driving and sport because you choose not to wear glasses or just that you wouldn't be able to do them without? </p><p> </p><p>Phil do you venture out without glasses or do you mean that you're happy around the house without them? </p><p> </p><p>I'm -2.75 and would struggle in the outside world without them but could get by of course.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hollie</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2005, 03:38</p><p>Until very recently, I would have been one of the people who said you needed correction fulltime at this level. But very recently I found out I can't wear contacts very often for a while, and daft as it may sound, I couldn't face fulltime glasses wearing! So now I wear glasses part-time, probably nealy half the time actually, as my prescription is -3.25 -1.25 and -3.50 -1, which is strong enough to need for lots of things- sometimes I even read with them on, as the book has to be fairly close to me if the type is small! </p><p>So yes, she wouldbe able to cope at this rx, its quite surprising that she doesn't wear though as most full-time wearers I know have lower (and some much lower) prescriptions than mine. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2005, 01:47</p><p>I agree Phil. I'm -2.75 and can function quite happily without correction. Just means things like driving, watching TV / sports etc get put on the back burner. </p><p>Its a myth that around these levels you HAVE to wear correction full time.
