<p><b></b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2016, 12:32</p><p>Hannah Russell, the GB Paralympic swimmer was wearing her myodisc glasses today in pictures covering Team GB returning from Rio. She's obviously very myopic, in the -20 something range but I wonder if she has any other visual impairment. Her eyes are quite large and turn in slightly and in one newspaper article she was described as suffering from "extreme myopia" but no other mention of her vision was made. Would extreme myopia be enough to earn a Paralympic classification? Surely one would have to be classified as "legally blind", i.e. visually impaired even with correction? She swims in the S12 and S13 categories but the definition of these seems quite vague from what I can find out. If you Google images of her she is quite clearly wearing contact lenses when she swims and so I wonder what exactly she can see and how much it impairs her ability to swim. I notice that swimmers in the S11 category wear blacked out goggles so they are all completely blind while swimming. I'm not sure if this is the case for the S12 and S13 categories. She's also very attractive by the way. The picture posted on Aug 17th doesn't do her justice.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maurice</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2016, 17:57</p><p>Thanks Jamie.  After reading your post I was able to find a picture of Dale wearing glasses while reading.  Guess between the inevitability of presbyopia and the concussion----glasses are here to stay.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maurice</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2016, 09:13</p><p>Saw video of Nascar driver Dale Earnhardt, Jr. wearing glasses as a result of a concussion.  Plus lenses.  I wonder if he will need to wear glasses from now on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;31 Aug 2016, 11:41</p><p>Michelle Wie is attractive. I could be that slim if I was stretched out as tall as her. I probably only come up to her waist. I actually prefer being curvy and a lot of people like me being curvy!&#128513; </p><p>I find British cyclist Laura Trott more attractive, mainly because she and my beautiful girlfriend look similar. Long lost sisters?&#128516; I don't think Laura wears glasses only safety glasses when cycling. It won't come as a surprise to you all that her fiance Jason Kenny (see Kevin's post) does nothing for me with or without glasses but what I do like is that it is highly likely that Laura has tried on Jason's glasses. If only someone had photographed that. Maybe one day Laura will need glasses. They are both brilliant athletes and also they are both genuinely nice people and I hope that they have a long and happy marriage (they were offered a large amount of money by a magazine for exclusive photos of their wedding. They declined the offer. They don't want to be celebrities they just want to be Mr and Mrs Kenny living quietly in their cottage in the countryside with their dogs. I think the only time they would like some attention is when they are in races and the support of people watching will help them along.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2016, 05:28</p><p>Thanks for the Michelle Wie piks. She is an attractive (and tall) young woman with great taste in eyewear. Some eyewear operation should sign her up as a model and spokesperson.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2015, 08:31</p><p>Being a bowler, I receive an email from the USBC each week with videos for allegedly improving one's game.  One of the people involved is Carolyn Dorin-Ballard, age 51, who won many tournaments on the women's pro tour when there was one.   </p><p> </p><p>Sometime in the previous decade, she and her younger sister Cathy Dorin-Lizzi were given a major makeover that was featured on a TV show.  Both women were given Lasik. I have not seen Cathy with glasses since, but Carolyn wears small, plastic, rectangular glasses all the time in the videos, and in the few times I have seen her on TV in the past several years.  Perchance CDB's Lasik did not work?  Before that, she wore glasses only when bowling, as she was somewhat nearsighted.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Willy</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2013, 13:40</p><p>The chart is a few random questions given to some stars of the US 1999 Womens World Cup team, and their responses.  The last column at the top says "I miss my..."  Mia Hamm's reponse is "I miss my 20/20 vision," so the implication is she now has glasses.  She is 41, so the time would be about right for reading glasses, although that might not usually be expressed as a loss of 20/20 vision....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2013, 13:39</p><p>She says she misses having 20/20 vision. She's 41 now -- might be needing reading glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2013, 15:28</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Here in the Philadelphia area we baseball fans would love it if the Phillies would run their or-guh-nye-zay-shun like the Cardinals do.  You may as well buy your playoff tickets now.  Want to switch ownership and front offices?  LOL </p><p> </p><p>As for the college scene, the glasses obviously helped some, but being ambidextrous, which helped me take more notes and complete essay questions on tests faster, was a good thing as well.  Of course, emphasizing studying over socializing was the big sacrifice, but I wanted my degrees, and that was most important.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2013, 15:19</p><p>Melyssa </p><p> </p><p>Yeah, were freakin out here in St. Louis with our Cardinals not playing like we think they should be playing but I guess we should be happy being 20 game over 500. I still think we won't go far in the playoffs with so many young starters. They will probably all be pretty good, but they seem to get rattled if anything goes wrong for them. It's nice to strike out 8 in 5 innings but not if your going to walk 4 as well.  </p><p>I'm betting it' s not glasses that made you smart or even look smart. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2013, 18:55</p><p>Crystal Veil  </p><p>I wish I could recall the name of the magazine it was in, but as best I can recall it was a men's magazine. Someone in here commented on it as well at the time. Even a lot of the news magazines reported the full top 10 on the list. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2013, 17:06</p><p>Soundmanpt &amp; Claire, </p><p> </p><p>I hope you don't mind me interfering with your chat - what you mention, Soundmanpt, about that survey in the UK is really encouraging. The recent hipster glasses trend may have done wonders :). I notice a slow but steady turn of appreciation for glasses in Holland as well, even on TV!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2013, 16:09</p><p>Clare </p><p>I just reread what I posted to you and I had a big mistake in it. I really need to start proof reading what I type. Anyway near the end I said "You honestly have come a very long way and even though you still prefer contacts, your NOT much more confident then you used to be". I didn't mean for the word not to be in there at all. I think you can tell it even makes more sense if you leave that word out. Besides you know I have told you before you have really gotten much better about wearing glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2013, 14:18</p><p>Soundmanpt - no nothing to declare on the wedding front! And regular wearing of glasses, even in the City, hasn't attracted any admirers :( </p><p> </p><p>Back to the comments on when people choose to wear glasses (which is where this post on Athletes started): I have one colleague who says she can't wear contacts in the office (I don't know why but she maybe suffers like me but isn't prepared to put up with it), I'd guess her Rx is around -4. Although she always wears glasses in the office I saw her dress to go to a black tie event and even she put in contacts. I am trying to psych myself up to be comfortable to wear contacts for social events. I do wear glasses at work but plan my contacts wear around what meetings and I have and - bizarrely - if I'm meeting someone new I always like to meet them first when I'm wearing contacts! I have a strange idea that I don't want people's first impression of me to be the blonde with glasses. Weird eh?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2013, 10:21</p><p>Clare </p><p>As you already well know in this forum most everyone would disagree with you about being less attractive wearing glasses, but about 2 years ago there was a survey done for some magazine and they asked a large number of men 10 things they found most attractive in women? Number 5 on the list was "glasses" That survey was done in the UK. Maybe in years past glasses were looked upon as somewhat of a flaw in a woman, but now not all the same way. Just like in that survey in that magazine men have found that a woman can be every bit as attractive wearing glasses as they are if they don't wear glasses. It's a shame that some of your friends haven't tested the waters and tried seeing the reactions they would get from being seen in glasses. At the very least it might provide them with a little more confidence to wear them. You honestly have come a very long way and even though you still prefer to wear contacts your not much more confident then you used to be. I'm sure no one has treated you any different when your wearing glasses compared to when your wearing contacts?  </p><p>Interesting you mentioned "wearing glasses as a bride" A while back some posted pictures of some various brides wedding pictures in their wedding dress and wearing glasses. The pictures came form a site asking the question "Should I wear glasses or contacts on my wedding day?" It was interesting all the comments from past bride and engaged young women that were torn with the same question. There was great arguments for both sides on that one. Some said that since everyone was used to seeing them wearing glasses they were going to keep their glasses on. but there were some that said they had looked at there mother's wedding pictures and their mother wore her glasses but it looked funny because that was 25 years ago and her glasses looked so out of date. Some simply said they were getting contacts for their wedding day period. A few said that they hadn't been wearing glasses all that long so they thought they could see good enough without them. Some even said they were having some pictures with and with glasses. But I guess when it really comes down to it, that should be decided by the bride and groom.  </p><p>Interesting you should be concerned about that, are you trying to tell us something? For you at least there is little doubt you will be a bride in contacts.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2013, 15:53</p><p>Soundmanpt - yes, there are people who are clueless and abuse contacts but I think the majority of people who love their contacts are people whose lifestyles better suit contacts or who just don't like how they look with glasses. It may be me but I think its only recently that the so-called risks of contacts have come to notice, I think people used to think they were the no-question alternative to glasses.  Most of my friends wear contacts, there's no-one who would choose to wear glasses if they could wear contacts. I don't think any of those friends would feel that they are more attractive when they wear glasses, in fact one friend in the past insisted on taking them off because she 'looks better without glasses'. I think there's a long way to go before people consider the risks of contacts and choose to go the glasses route. that's a shame because I'd like to think that more people would choose glasses and so we'd get over the stigma that still exists - take for example the issues that exist when people need to wear glasses for their wedding.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2013, 12:05</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Your reasons for not liking contacts are the same as mine. </p><p>I know you have to take proper care of them or you can damage your corneas and I'm lazy. Besides, I don't want to spend money on expensive toric lenses when I can get lined bifocals from Zenni Optical for $31.90.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2013, 11:30</p><p>Clare </p><p>Well admittedly I much prefer seeing an attractive young woman wearing glasses then one not wearing glasses. That in no means that non wearer isn't attractive, just not as much to me.  </p><p>Also I really don't think contacts are all that good for the eyes. In a large part they are often abused by the wearer. As you well know they take a certain amount of care or you can easily get eye infections. And like yourself even with good care you can start to have problems with them. Add to that for too many I have come across think that by wearing contacts that's all they need and they never bother even getting glasses to go with them so they can relax their eyes. Then there are quite a few that only upgrade their contacts every year and ignore upgrading the lenses in their glasses enough due to cost.  </p><p>But that said I think contacts are great for certain things and are a much better choice than glasses. I was a softball manager of a women's team many years ago. I had the team for 12 years and during that time some of my girls became glasses wearers. I actually suggested that they get contacts because wearing glasses was too dangerous. And like I said about this young lady golfer I am surprised she doesn't wear contacts because even though there is no danger wearing glasses her vision would be with hitting a golf ball.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2013, 00:38</p><p>Soundmanpt - what are the reasons that you don't like contacts?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2013, 13:58</p><p>Being a golfer myself I am very surprised that Marina is more comfortable wearing glasses than contacts. As much as I am not a big fan of contacts they are really a better option for sports. but since she is still only 19 she probably has always played wearing glasses so she is maybe feels more comfortable wearing glasses since that is what she is most used to. </p><p>Needless to say I am going to have to start watching more women's golf. I do know that there are several very attractive ladies playing competive golf these days. I keep hoping to see pictures of ones like Paula Creamer wearing glasses as well as others.  </p><p></p><hr>

The photo in the first link definitely makes them look plano, but in the second link, his eyes look pretty magnified by the lenses. A third photo also makes the lenses look like mild plus. Thoughts? </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180726061439/http://sfbay.ca/home/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/130208_GiantsFanFest0360_Lincecum2-1000x425.jpg" target="_blank">http://sfbay.ca/home/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/130208_GiantsFanFest0360_Lincecum2-1000x425.jpg</a> </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180726061439/http://blogimages.thescore.com/mlb/files/2013/02/lince.jpg" target="_blank">http://blogimages.thescore.com/mlb/files/2013/02/lince.jpg</a> </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180726061439/http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20130208/sports/702089630/photos/AR/" target="_blank">http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20130208/sports/702089630/photos/AR/</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jamie32</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2013, 09:40</p><p>Anyone else seen Michael Phelps has been rocking the glasses as of late. Not sure if they're for fashion or not but me thinks maybe a 1st time wearer for real</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2013, 04:34</p><p>Nice way of putting it Asdoo; of course it depends on the axis of the cylinder. In the case of the guy in the supermarket the image through his glasses was tall and thin.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Asdoo</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2013, 02:47</p><p>You can tell glasses have cylinder if they make objects look tilty or swirly. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2013, 02:03</p><p>David: unless there's a lot of cylinder in a lens you can only tell by holding it up and either rotating it or turning round in a circle (sorry I'm describing very badly what I mean!) High astigmatism is unmistakeable - a glance at someone's glasses shows an image that's elongated rather than enlarged (or reduced in a case of myopia). I caught a glimpse of a guy with glasses like that in a supermarket the other day. If David Akers has astigmatism it isn't like that - but I wouldn't call him VERY hyperopic either.</p><p></p><hr>

I did a double take, as DRC was wearing a pair of large, plastic, lavender frames to go with his lavender outfit.  That makes DRC the second Eagle I've spotted in women's frames, following Hollis Thomas' small drop-temples about 5-7 years ago.  DRC's frames would be more my style than HT's, as DRC's are larger.</p><p></p><hr>

She and some of her fellow, equally very attractive, team-mates waved and smiled at the tv camera as they walked past it to leave the stadium. I am now a secret fan of Rhythmic Gymnastics. Not so much the sport itself but mainly the girls who do it! The Team GB Rhythmic Gymnasts all seem to be slim, petite and pretty especially Georgina with her cool glasses. I missed the gymnastics when it was on tv so I didn't see what the other gymnast looked like. My girlfriend could pass off as one of the GB gymnasts as she is also slim, petite and pretty. I am also petite (ok, short!), a lot of people think I'm pretty but I'm not as slim as the gymnasts. I'm not fat or even chubby but I could do with losing a little bit of weight. </p><p>I did notice a lot more of the female athletes from all the countries were wearing glasses at the closing ceremony than at the opening ceremony.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2012, 20:59</p><p>I was watching the amazing opening ceremony of the Olympics on tv earlier and noticed several female athletes wearing glasses and most of those were quite good looking (some were not at all attractive). I wonder how many of them will be wearing their glasses when they take part in their events. I'm not much of a sports fan so I don't think I can sit through hours of sport just in case there's a hotty wearing glasses and there's thousands of athletes. I will try to watch Victoria Pendleton in her cycling events as she is gorgeous and wear glasses sometimes (I think she wears contacts most of the time). Another "Team GB" athlete I find very fanciable is Jessica Ennis. I'm not sure what sports she does but I don't think she wears glasses as I can't find any pics of her wearing them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2012, 14:43</p><p>Just found out that occasional glasses wearer and hot cyclist Victoria Pendleton will represent Britain in the Olympics this year. I might just watch her races! </p><p>On the olympics them I have seen a few nice girls with glasses taking part in the Olympic Torch Relay around Britain. Some I've seen on tv and others I've seen on the live video on the BBC website. I've probably missed loads as well. There are hundreds of people taking part and it goes for about 12 hours every single day! It is strangely addictive watching a complete stranger running or walking with an Olympic torch! The security guards that run or walk with the Torch Bearer are very fit (and some of them quite hot) police officers. I'm sure I saw one of the female guards wearing glasses the other day but the live camera very rarely shows a good shot of any of the guards unless they are the one that switches one torch off and the next one on as the torches meet. I keep checking the live video when I get a chance - just in case. I think there was one fairly good looking girl with glasses running in the English county of Suffolk on Thursday (I forget which town it was). It starts off again at 6:52am UK time tomorrow (Saturday) from Chelmsford in Essex and finishes in Cambridge in Cambridgeshire (the famous University city) at 6:46pm (yes, they are the official times! Why not 6:50am or even 7:00am? Very strange. </p><p>If you want to try your luck at possibly seeing a good looking girl with glasses here's the link <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180726061439/http://www.bbc.co.uk/torchrelay" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/torchrelay</a> (the runners/walkers are male and female and all ages so you might never see what you are looking for) I'm afraid you will have to work out the time difference for your part of the world yourselves! :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2012, 19:30</p><p>Looking for information on Jennifer Capriati I could not find any pictures of her wearing glasses but I did find an article about her failing her driver's vision test and getting glasses. It went on to say that she wore glasses of court, I assume full time, and contacts for tennis matches. It went on to say that she had laser surgery but it must not have worked so well because she stated she has to wear her glasses quite often still. Wish i could have found out more, like what went wrong with her surgery etc. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt </b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2012, 18:33</p><p>Brian </p><p> </p><p>Yes!  Thank you, Yeah I think it was a sports article about her. Not sure what she is doing these days.

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2012, 14:30</p><p>Your thinking of Jennifer Capriati.. That article was in tennis magazine.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2012, 10:37</p><p>Carrie </p><p> </p><p>I know what you mean about remembering the names of some of the players these days, it's hard to keep up with so many new young players coming along each year. Maybe someone can enlighten us as to her name. </p><p>I agree it would be nice to see Anna wearing glasses but not too likely. If anything she may wear contacts. </p><p>A good many years ago I recall a very young attractive American girl that was a rising star in tennis. When she became 16 she went for her drivers license and she failed the vision test. She and her parents were shocked that she needed glasses. Of course she went straight to contacts There were a few pictures of her away from tennis wearing glasses. The odd thing was she seemed to be a better tennis player when her vision was still uncorrected then after she got contacts. She continued to play tennis but never made it very big and was out tennis at an early age. The amazing thing is that she somehow must not have been given an eye exam much earlier in her career. Tennis is based on having very good hand eye cordination and having blurred vision had to make that hard for her. i can't remember her name either, but maybe someone else can help. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2012, 10:41</p><p>Does British tennis player Elena Baltacha wear contacts now? She used to wear glasses pretty much all the time. I saw a bit of Wimbledon the other day and she wasn't wearing glasses. I can't make up my mind about her sometimes she looks a bit butch and other times she looks very feminine and sort of fanciable. </p><p>Also, I think it was Thursday evening, I briefly saw another female tennis player wearing glasses at Wimbledon, but I can't remember her name. I think it began with a B and I think her her was brownish. I can't even remember what nationality she was! She was quite pretty though. </p><p>Of course it would be wonderful if Anna Kournikova wore glasses! </p><p>I'm not a huge sports fan but I do occasionally watch Wimbledon when it's on. I don't just watch it for the the hot female players in their short tennis skirts and tight tops (but it has become more of a reason to watch ever since I realised I was into girls!), some of the men are ok too! Oh yeah, and the games can actually get exciting at times!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2012, 19:23</p><p>About 20, or maybe even 30, years ago there was a professional tennis player called, I think, Camille Benjamin.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2012, 14:49</p><p>Yes Billie Jean wore glasses before anyone ever thought of making sport goggles. Now like this young lady she is lucky enough to have glasses that wrap on all sides of her eyes so her vision should be about the same as how people see with contacts. This girls glasses look like they were made just for her as they fit under here yes as well as on the sides. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2012, 13:11</p><p>Yes, Billie Jean Moffett King was a pioneer in a lot of ways, very few athletes in any sport wore glasses then.  In an interview once she gave great credit to her glasses for her career (think she said she got them in her early teens) because she said she couldn't do much without them. Besides the plastic frames, for a period of time she wore the octagonal rimless gold cable temple wire frames, of the type also worn by the late Secy. of Defense McNamara.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2012, 10:28</p><p>Steve's post about a tennis player just getting a correction seems to be history repeating itself.  In the early 80's Martina Navratilova dominated women's tennis, but in late 1984-early 1985 her game deteriorated at the age of 28. </p><p> </p><p>She got her eyes tested and started wearing glasses, Sports Illustrated ran a great story on her resurgence that included the role of the glasses, I dug the story out after seeing Steve's clip.  There was a great photo of her at the caption showing her hitting a forehand with her semi rimless large aviator style frames on. The text said her eyesight had "deteriorated from an excellent 20/15 to a slightly nearsighted 20/40".  She won the first major she played in shortly after getting her glasses and whipped Chris Evert Lloyd 5 sets to 1 for the Virginia Slims championship.  The photo next to that passage showed her holding the glasses by the bridge, up above her forehead to clean them, which gave a great view of the prescription which was probably in the -1.00 to -1.50 range. </p><p> </p><p>And it ended with a cute comment, in a practice session with her coach the writer said "Natravilova missed a volley and quickly realized she had forgotten to don her new specs. After retrieving them she warned 'Now I am really going to kick ass'".</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2011, 18:49</p><p>Chrissi </p><p>I knew he had laser done but I didn't know he had a "touch-up" done in 2007. I don't know where he went in 1999, but I know around 2007 or 2008 he was advertising for  </p><p>"TLC" It is very possible that he went to TLC in 1999 as well because they offer a warranty that as long as you get exams each year if your vision changes and becomes more than -1.25 they will redo it at no charge. this is really very common and i'm sure other places offer the same deal. It is not because the surgery failed it is because the patient's eyes were still changing when they had the orginal lasik done. If someone is considering getting it done that is something you should be sure they offer unless you don't have a problem with maybe needing glasses again in the future. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2011, 22:59</p><p>Hey all, not sure if anyone has brought this up in the past and not trying to spark up any kind of debate, but today for some reason I looked up Tiger Woods on Wikipedia and it says that in 1999 he had laser eye surgery (minus 11, apparently) and he had the surgery again in 2007. Interesting, I never knew that. Anyway, thought I'd post it.</p><p></p><hr>

I rooted for the Cardinals (not easy with Scott Rolen on the team then) in 2006 against the Mets (with Billy Wagner, an even bigger POSADA than Rolen, but less than J.D. Drew).  That pitcher you referred to, Cueto, pitches Sunday night, and the Phillies beat him 22-1 last year.  And I cannot recall what glasses I wore during that game.  :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Oct 2010, 21:31</p><p>Melyssa </p><p>Just so you know since my Cardinals aren't in it this year I am rooting for your Phillies.

I do wish the style would return, with a stipulation that no one on Medicare can wear any until I get the frames I want.  LOL</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;07 Oct 2010, 14:49</p><p>Jennifer, </p><p> </p><p>The one good thing about the Dodgers being in the playoffs would be to see family members when the Phillies are the opponents.  Also, since the Dodgers left Brooklyn, they have 4 world championships to the Phillies' 2, most of which came before your time (like the Eagles here). </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Unnamed Poster, </p><p> </p><p>No, I was not wearing red frames for the Phillies, as none of those glasses were on the schedule.  I wore tortoiseshell octagon frames.  Of course, I cannot remember what glasses I wore for Doc Halladay's perfect game, or for the Phillies' 2008 clincher.

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2010, 12:58</p><p>I didn't become interested in hockey until the Broad Street Bullies came along, so I don't know if any other players besides Alger Arbour wore glasses.

<p><b>Luke</b>&nbsp;26 Apr 2010, 16:11</p><p>soundmanpt - You wrote "some may wear contacts".  I suspect there are a LOT who wear contacts.  I play in a recreational sports league and the majority of the players wear contacts while playing -- almost none wear glasses while playing, though many wear glasses otherwise.  I think Lasik is still a little bit risky in many people's eyes (no pun intended), but contacts are almost automatic for myopic athletes...and a study recently found that 40% of Americans are myopic (higher for younger population).  If we see someone, of young adult age, on the street and they aren't wearing glasses, it's kind of a crazy assumption to assume they are uncorrected.</p><p></p><hr>

She had no idea she needed glasses. I never saw her wear glasses while playing so she must have opted for contacts. It is surprising that she so well before getting correction, her vision had to be worse than 20/40 or she would have past the driver's test. I think she has since had lasix. </p><p>I just heard on the news that Mr. Howard of the Phillies just signed a 5 year $125,000,000 deal. As you may have heard we are wanting to wrap up Albert for life. I am sure it will take even more to sign him long term.</p><p></p><hr>

I remember looking through my cousins old BB cards and finding many of these players in his collection of cards.  Imagine these guys having to play with glasses.  I can't even imagine a catcher, Darrell Porter, pulling his face mask off to catch a fly ball and his glasses coming off in the mask!  Those must have been the good old days, for us mig lovers to watch them play with glasses.  Great!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;24 Apr 2010, 09:07</p><p>Greg Maddux wore contacts when he pitched, glasses on the other days, until he got Lasix.  Fortunately for the Phillies, his pitching did not improve.  A little bit of aging probably helped with that.  With glasses, he was not-too-shabby in the looks department, though.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>hooked</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2008, 23:48</p><p>I'm living in Switzerland and this evening is the Letzigrund meeting in Zurich so there was an article about Tia and something about her glasses this morning in the newspaper. </p><p>Some small excerpts for this article: </p><p>1. She can't wear contacts due to an eye infection. </p><p>2. Her vision is better with glasses than without. </p><p>3. She has a contract with a glasses manufacturer </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>kisal</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2008, 05:54</p><p>I was fortunate enough to see the very brief coverage that NBC in the US gave to Tia's gold medal winning Olympic high jump.  And then I OD'd on all the lovely pictures in the link below.  Not only is she amazingly beautiful with fabulous legs, but what just knocks me out is that she wears her specs while running, jumping, etc.  And not clunky sports glasses, but her gorgeous (and I think quite "suitable") designer frames.  This really shows that GWG's can do anything!  I'm sure as the first female gold medalist for her country, that Tia is quite a superstar in Belgium. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dark Eyes</b>&nbsp;01 Sep 2006, 14:06</p><p>Jennifer, </p><p> </p><p>Well we can hope!  </p><p> </p><p>Jacques has said there are other drivers in F1 who wear contacts, but none of them are brave enough to wear glasses, but he would not name them.  The only other driver who is open about wearing glasses/contacts to drive is Ralf Schumacher, who has certainly come in for his share of stick over it.  </p><p> </p><p>It is interesting to note, that it seems mainly F1 that has this prejudice, the American series do not seem at all bothered.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;31 Aug 2006, 13:37</p><p>Dark Eyes, </p><p>I've noticed this too.  In NASCAR, Kyle Petty has been wearing glasses for a long time.  I think he switches back and forth between contacts and glasses.  Maybe we'll start seeing more wearing glasses!  I hope!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dark Eyes</b>&nbsp;31 Aug 2006, 12:15</p><p>There seem to be more racing drivers with glasses these days, not something you think would have happened a few years ago. </p><p> </p><p>There's Sebastien Bourdais who drives in Champ Car, not particularly nice looking.  </p><p> </p><p>And the very handsome Jacques Villeneuve who drives in Formula 1, he has said that some people told him not to even bother trying to become a racing driver because he wore glasses. He won the World Championship in 1997, but this still did not silence these people and his eyesight has been mentioned several times as a factor to any accidents he has had. Unfairly of course, as all racing drivers have accidents at some point. </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if it is just coincidence, or that I've only noticed since then, but since Jacques started in F1 in 1996, there seem to be a lot more racing drivers with glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

When he scored a goal against Estudiantes from Argentina in 1970, one of the Argetinian defenders took his glasses and broke them with his feet.  </p><p> </p><p>Some Dutch artist wrote a song called 'Het brilletje van Van Daele' ('Van Daele's pair of specs'), which made it into the Top 40 :-)</p><p></p><hr>

Then again, a while back that noted intellectual David Beckham went through a phase of wearing plano glasses 'cause he thought he looked good in them. He did, too.

<p><b></b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2006, 15:45</p><p>The fact that I have seen very few premiership footballers ever wearing glasses can only mean two things.

As someone who is transfixed by blonde women wearing big plastic frames those pre-1992 photographs of her are a real find. Top discovery, Maverik!Especially the 1991 US Open picture (bottom right of the threefrom that tournament) where she is wearing HUGE plastic frames with her blonde hair up:))))))))))))  I melt with delight:) Great find, Maverik!</p><p></p><hr>

The only time I remember seeing a pic of her playing with specs on was when she was a newcomer to the circuit and there was a pic in the European newspaper. It must have been over 12 years ago.  </p><p>Not 100% sure but those specs are the same ones (I seem to remember) as way back then. Have since seen her away from tennis in a few pics and her RX has increased.  </p><p>Many thanks for posting that link.</p><p></p><hr>

I started wearing glasses around 5 judging from a picture when I was about 8 I would say my lenses were around -6.5D, Every time I went for an eye examination I would try to cheat to get stronger lenses, at 16 I was a -12.5.Every time I got new glasses I was amaised at how clear things could be. I am now 26 just got my first myodisks -1575. I will say they will take some getting use to. With out glasses I cant find my way around at at all. I am amaised at how dependent I have become but I love every minute of it. (strange girl) About a year ago I met this Bloke In an icecream parlour right away I noticed he was intreasted in my glasses. </p><p>I have to say I was intreasted to see why he was so intreasted in me.

He told me that he could see the blurry ball enough to hit it when it came his way but could not see anyone on the other team or the net except for when he was in the front row. </p><p> </p><p>I asked him if he knew his Rx.  He took off and held out his glasses and told me he didn't know his Rx but to look at how powerful they were.  I asked if I could try them on and he politely said no and that he rather hang onto them.  He then put them back on. </p><p> </p><p>This got me thinking that maybe his Rx is stronger than I thought.  I didn't look to see how much smaller his eyes got either.  </p><p> </p><p>We talked some more and parted ways but not before exchanging contact information.  We have been in touch.

I guess a spring training eye exam lead to a perscription--at age 27. Too bad there seem to be no pictures, he's a good looking guy, almost a resemblance to Freddie Prinze Jr. and I bet he looks great with glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>I know the Mets catcher, Jason Phillips wears Rx goggles on the field although he doesn't do much for me looks-wise. I guess he tried contacts in the minor leagues but found them too cumbersome before switching to glasses full-time. I love baseball and I think it's always fun to see who wears glasses off the field. </p><p></p><hr>

Not in the Kournikova class?, Hmmmm.... </p><p>Don't know,I've never seen Kournikova in specs....  </p><p> </p><p>          Myodisc</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>clare</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2003, 13:57</p><p>Aha Julian, I think the very same pic was in today's Metro (cheap and nasty freebie tabloid distributed at London stations).  It was David Beckham c1996 I believe, although the Metro version wasn't conclusive your post confirms what I suspected.  Did he look good?  Couldn't tell from what the guy on the train next to me *allowed* me to see, I think it was a profile shot.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2003, 05:01</p><p>THE SUN (vile tabloid newspaper IMHO) has David Beckham in glasses on the front page - wire aviators. I don't think they are non-Rx shades; they look low minus, and I have heard that he's a bit short-sighted. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bert</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2003, 10:04</p><p>Followers of the tennis at Wimbledon yesterday will have seen GWG Elena Baltacha, playing in rimless glasses, and then being interviewed after her game in fashionable brown-rimmed narrow rectangular-style glasses. Impossible to tell whether she is plus or minus. Not in the Kournikova class for looks but a nice change when probably most athletes who need glasses use contacts. </p><p> </p><p>Too bad for us Brits - Baltacha was born in USSR but is now British - that she was knocked out in the first round.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kix</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2003, 08:33</p><p>Ok, this isn't really an athlete but it is sports related. For sports fans (living in the US) there is an anchor on ESPN's Sportscenter who is a pretty delicious Guy With Glasses. He has dark brown hair and a tawny complexion and the most discreet pair of rimless specs I have probably ever seen. I can't tell an Rx but he has done his best to pick out a pair that is almost invisible. I think his name is Neil Everitt and I usually see him on the weekend episodes. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2003, 14:59</p><p>And not many baseball players wear glasses, either.  Though Reggie did it, it's tough to hit with glasses on.  Batters can't easily look straight ahead at the ball, so the edges of glasses frames and lenses make it tough to hit with them on.  It might not make a big difference, but players at that level can't afford to lose any edge at all.  Pitchers, on the other hand, can probably get away with it.  Players on both sides could probably benefit from the safety of (proper) glasses, but that's never been a primary concern of most players in sports as far as I can tell.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>holysmoke</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2003, 14:27</p><p>Baseball has long been a sport where players have worn their glasses in games. Even some of the games superstars (Reggie Jackson) have played with their glasses on. In the U.S., very few players in any of the other team sports wear glasses on field.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glassez luva</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2003, 20:40</p><p>Wurm </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for starting the Athletes category.  Thought I am only attracted to females, I am really intrigued by the athletes both male and female relying on glasses and contacts, as opposed to Lasik. </p><p> </p><p>The fact that I still see athletes relying on vision correction keeps me hopeful that Lasik is not all that it is cracked up to be.  And who depends on clear vision more than athletes do? </p><p> </p><p>I hope that more people post to this category, athletes who still rely on glasses and contacts.  Probably just this summer, I spotted World Series hero Troy Glaus sporting specs, during an interview.  And just off hand, I have also seen Giants shortshop Rich Aurilia wearing glasses as well.  I have also seen basketball star Vince Carter in glasses, and during the 2000 or 2001?  NBA All Star game, I recall Grant Hill leaving the game, because he lost a contact lens. </p><p> </p><p>I would be very interested in hearing about other athletes who rely on vision correction, especially Canadian skater Jamie Sale.  I have heard that she wears glasses.  I wish someone would post a pick of her on eye scene. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>
