<p><b>tinyeyes </b>&nbsp;07 May 2018, 01:10</p><p>I forgot to mention that the really important "sweet spot" is his anus.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;06 May 2018, 17:17</p><p>James, I agree about having a "sweet spot" as far as myopia attracting me in guys, and it's not a number for me either, but probably usually corresponds with a number. I want them to be as myopic as I am preferably, (I'm -9) and really, the higher the myopia the better, but I have little experience with seeing or being around guys more than the mid-teens. I also want them to be able to function well with glasses or contacts, but I'm extremely aroused by seeing the effects of not having corrective lenses on -- like holding things close to read, closing an eye, and squinting. And the stronger the glasses look, the better -- huge cut-in, "power rings", flashing reflective flat lens fronts, and of course, tiny eyes. It seems like the "dream" prescription for having all this and also functioning well is about -12 to -17. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;04 May 2018, 15:41</p><p>hi all </p><p> </p><p>maybe i should have been clearer....i understand in theory all the challenges of extreme myopia (as a fetishist of 3 decades' standing I should hope so!) and the sweet spot etc. This guy wasn't wearing myodiscs, as I said, just small oval frames, but that's not really what's important here. </p><p> </p><p>I should clarify when I said what he was doing was crazy i wasn't meaning he was a crazy person or underestimating or making light of the challenges of this kind of vision. I just meant it struck ME as crazy that this - almost touching the phone to his one eye, basically - was the best solution for a function (looking at your phone and reading things and writing messages etc.) that in 2018 most of us do dozens if not HUNDREDS of times a day. Surely there's something better? Surely even carrying a pair of intermediate prescription glasses is better, particularly for when you know you're not going to need to see in the distance e.g. if you're going to be sitting on a train for half an hour, as this guy was? </p><p> </p><p>With all that said, I also understand that this guy knows his vision and what works best for the challenge better than I ever could, so he was obviously implementing the solution he felt most appropriate!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;04 May 2018, 09:30</p><p> </p><p>Hi James -- </p><p> </p><p>I have extreme myopia (-26/-27) and totally concur with what Cactus Jack says.  As myopia begins to creep over -20, most myopic people begin to consider myodisc lenses which allows for thinner and lighter lenses which usually can be fitted closer to a person's face thus improving visual acuity and helping to minimize problems of minimification.  Contacts are still the best for high myopes.  The myodisc "bowl" is usually around 20 - 25 MM wide and mimics the "sweet spot" found in conventional full-aperture lenses.  When I switched from conventional lenses to myodiscs I was already used to seeing through the sweet spot of the conventional lens which is about the same size as the myodisc bowl.  If you ever notice the body language of a high myope, you will see that they always have to turn their head more to see something to their left/right since their vision is pretty much restricted to that small "sweet spot".  In short, peripheral vision is somewhat limited.  I also have heard that some labs can do bifocal lenses in extreme powers, but generally the answer is no.  The area of the myodisc bowl generally is too small for a successful bifocal simply because there isn't adequate space.  The same is true for high-strength conventional lenses which require smaller frames to keep lens thickness to reasonable levels.  I have reading/computer glasses of a lesser power which I need to see up close.  If I don't have them with me, then I have to pull my glasses down my nose a bit to read.  Not ideal, but something you simply get used to.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;04 May 2018, 07:28</p><p>Thanks James for the beyond interesting sighting that you shared, and the details and observations provided.  I would tend to agree with you and Alex that the range of upper single digit myopia to as high as it can go without being life disruptive would be my level of interest.  Also how rather ordinary looking guys, which most of us probably are, can become of much more interest when wearing moderate to high level minus Rx's.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;03 May 2018, 17:49</p><p>James </p><p>I cannot comment on anything but vision and optics, with high myopia.  </p><p>  </p><p>High minus lenses have a very small sweet spot at the optical center of the lens where best Visual Acuity (VA) occurs.  That typically means that the lenses must be mounted in the frames so the central axis of vision passes through the Optical Center (OC) of the lens.  Outside the OC, there is considerable distortion and aberration. </p><p> </p><p>The lenses, in his very small frame glasses, actually may have started life a a myocisc. Rather than mount the lenses in a larger frame where the area outside the myodisc bowl is useless, they chose to use a very small frame and cut the lens down to fit the frame and eliminate the carrier portion of the lens blank. </p><p> </p><p>Because of the lens size and the power of the lenses, it may not be physically possible to have a reading segment in the lens and leave enough room for a usable distance segment.  Bifocals are very difficult or sometime impossible to include in a myodisc lens. </p><p> </p><p>If his prescription was -20 and he tried to read without his glasses, he would have to hold the text about 2 inches or 5 cm from his Cornea.  To use both eyes simultaneously to focus close, he would have required extreme convergence, probably in excess of 60 prism diopters to not see double.  The solution was to not even attempt to use both eyes simultaneously, but simple close 1 eye and eliminate the need for extreme convergence. </p><p> </p><p>He might have had some slightly less minus single vision reading and computer glasses at home. </p><p> </p><p>Another issue that occurs with very high minus glasses is image minification.  It is common for people who need very high minus glasses to experience a reduction in VA because of that minification.  The image gets so small on the Retina that the eye cannot detect very small objects or letters.  Needing very high minus glasses is like wearing very high PLUS lenses inside the eye.  TheY MAGNIFY the images on the retina and make it easier to see the small text on the cell phone. </p><p> </p><p>He was not doing anything crazy, he was just solving his vision problems with the tools he had at hand. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;03 May 2018, 14:25</p><p>Alex, </p><p> </p><p>The lower threshold is easier to determine for me. If he can function well or even semi-OK without glasses, the turn on factor goes down exponentially. Very low prescription glasses are actually worse than no glasses at all for me; at least with no glasses, I can imagine there may be strong contacts, especially when something intangible about the eyes themselves is tipping me off that he's a high myope. In practice, nothing below -6 (and more like 08 if I'm being honest) really turns my head.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alex</b>&nbsp;03 May 2018, 12:57</p><p>James </p><p> </p><p>You raise a pretty interesting point,i do agree with you that having a myopia which really impairs vision even with glasses is a pretty big turn off. </p><p> </p><p>What is so sexy about myopia is how it does give a semi-disability which weaken the eyesight without causing a great harm,after all you just need a pair of glasses to correct it,which are form of dependance on their own because one need always them to see. </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if there's also a sweet spot in the reverse direction for too low prescriptions.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;03 May 2018, 12:22</p><p>Greetings fellow sodomites in spectacles! Sidenote: as a non-wearer-but-admirer of spectacles sodomite, that characterisation actually made me feel left out! </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, today on the train there was a guy with one of these see-them-once-a-year knockout Rx's. He must've been close to -20, or maybe more, no myodiscs but teeny wire rim tiny ovals. Probably late 30's or early 40's, average height and weight and Indian or Pakistani, but nothing that'd attract my attention without the glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>He seemed to be able to see fine in the distance, so there was no sense of him being low vision (important for what I'm about to ask next), but was doing crazy things to see and type texts on his phone i.e. looking over his phone,closing one eye and basically almost touching the phone with the other eye. Honestly, why not just get multifocals or bifocals in a bigger frame! </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, it did get me thinking about something only slightly related, which is: do other people have a myopia "sweet spot" beyond which they're no longer turned on, as I do? For me, the sweet spot is not a number....they can be as nearsighted as possible (the more the better really) as long as they get good usable vision and don't seem "disabled" in a narrow sense. So no low vision aids, no canes, obvious inability to see enough even with the glasses....those kinds of things obliterate any arousal for me. </p><p> </p><p>I know that wouldn't be true for everyone here, but was wondering if anyone else had ever considered this for themselves. Thoughts?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;14 Apr 2018, 10:23</p><p>Thanks te, for sharing your Target sighting and for your detailed description of the guy.  You raise some interesting questions/possibilities there, which I certainly don't know the answer to, either as to his preference or his glasses. Another possibility, I guess, could be that he is primarily a contacts wearer, so doesn't care as much about the look of his glasses, and maybe you were just fortunate enough to catch him on a day when his eyes were tired of contacts.  Again, thanks for sharing the sighting.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;14 Apr 2018, 08:26</p><p>I had a decent sighting yesterday that made me wonder about something.  </p><p>I was at Target, and saw a young Asian guy from behind looking at groceries and choosing some bottles of juice. He was late 20s/early 30s, dressed in stylish workout pants, small toned build with a nice ass, and of course, glasses. I suspected high RX since he was Asian, and then I saw the light flashing in that way (still viewing from behind him) that shows the lenses were strong. I was discreet, but stayed in the area long enough to see him when he turned around with his shopping cart, and yes, his small rectangular frames looked great and the cut-in was deep. Maybe -10. Gay or straight? I have a very hard time figuring that out these days, but hopefully gay! </p><p> </p><p>What I also noticed was that even though his frames were smaller, there was plenty of unpolished lens edge visible protruding beyond the black frames. That was a little surprising to me -- young, stylish guy, who's very myopic, but apparently didn't bother to get high index lenses for his glasses. I wonder, was it just not recommended, or is it a cultural thing not to care? Or it could possibly be that he doesn't like the vision with higher index lenses. Of course, I love the look, but I think his lenses could have been thinner at that size, unless I underestimated the prescription and it's up higher in the teens than I thought (I only got a quick glance facing him, trying to be discreet.)   </p><p> </p><p>At any rate, it was a sexy sighting. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2018, 16:55</p><p>Another trip to the local big box home improvement store today and another good sighting, although not as good as the one shared recently. This time I had to do a special order of some flooring and was fortunate enough to be helped by a younger myopic guy (his general looks and glasses reminded me lot of daviewheeler, if you know who I mean).  We spent about 15 minutes at his desk while he processed the order and I am guessing he is -7 or so, but several times he had to move his face closer to the screen to read some finer details.  After the order was finished, I was hoping for a minute or 2 of general chat, but there was another customer waiting for help so I didn't want to impose any further delay on the waiting customer.    </p><p> </p><p>I also agree the recent Facebook post was off-topic and inappropriate for this thread.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2018, 07:15</p><p>Thanks Jamie for the feedback on what is certainly one of the best sightings I have had.  Woke upo this morning thinking about it...., even before I read your post.  Just wish he had been alone.  If he had, I think I would have mustered the courage to try and strike up a conversation him. It was that compelling.  </p><p> </p><p>Thanks also for the updates on your own Rx and new glasses.  I forget if you ever mentioned what you Rx is or how it changed with you most recent exam, other than the bifocal add. Glad you are getting used to, and enjoying the benefits, of the mild bifocal correction.   </p><p> </p><p>I can't recall if we have chatted before or not, but if that would of interest to you, I am at gbruny@hotmail.com. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks and regards. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2018, 20:03</p><p>Nice sighting today at the local big box home improvement center, where I spend way too much time and money these days with a remodel underway.  I was heading to the self checkout and spotted, already in the checkout area,  this guy that caused me to think I was seeing the man of my dreams. Looked to be mid-40's or so, average height and weight,average looks, but way above average in terms of his myopia, probably upper teens at least, thick and very reflective flat lenses in smaller black plastic frames.  Certainly caught my attention in all ways.  He seemed to be a very pleasant and engaging, guy just overhearing a bit of his chat with the female checkout attendant.  There was another lady standing there also, so not sure if she was with him, or another employee.  If he was alone I was hoping to engage a conversation as we walked out, but alas, he wasn't alone. He walked out with the other lady, so I didn't want to intrude with trying to start a conversation.  I watched as they walked to their SUV and loaded some stuff in the back, and the she walked to the driver's side and he to the passenger side, so not sure if maybe he had a driving restriction or not.  Certainly the best sighting I have had in a long time, so thought it might be worth sharing.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2018, 11:19</p><p>In case you haven't seen already, you may want to check out the latest Tumblr post by Marcoeyes.  It is of a very talented, handsome, and significantly myopic Hungarian singer who goes by the stage name of "Freddie", and competes in the Eurovision talent contest.  If you are into myopic guys, especially wearing their much more than a fashion statement, ie totally necessary, glasses, this is a video you won't want to miss.  He seems to not be shy about wearing his glasses in public, or even when performing, and some of the closeups are very exciting.  Marcoeyes has featured him for the past week or or so, and has some great photos,screenshots, and commentary, but this video is like the cherry on top.  Sorry I couldn't figure out how to bring the video link directly to this thread.  Maybe someone else would know how to do that.  Anyway, if your into this, and haven't already seen you may want to check out, and enjoy, this video on Marcoeyes blog.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2018, 11:44</p><p>Thanks Roberto for sharing the barbershop sighting.  Sounds like a pretty high degree of myopia there, but not sure if there is a specific name for it.  Hopefully the barber handed him his glasses back before asking his opinion on his new haircut.  Barbershop sightings like this are pretty exciting to watch.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Roberto</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2018, 10:43</p><p>A sighting.  </p><p> </p><p>I was sitting, waiting at the barber shop to get my weekly beard line up. While sitting a handsome Latino man, about late 20's, button up shirt, jeans, black, slacks,  loafers with black rimmed ray bans was wearing the thickest lenses. I saw him sit on the barber chair and he began to hold a conversation with his barber while texting. He told the barber how he wanted to style his hair. The barber asked him if he could remove his glasses. </p><p> </p><p>The glasses guy asked if he could hold on while he sent a text to work because he could not see without his glasses. He took his glasses off and held them in his right hand. The barber reached for them and said hey man ill put them here (meaning his counter).  </p><p> </p><p>While he took the glasses the glasses guy's eyes were shifting.  </p><p>He was giving these lost looks. HIs eyes were squinting, then would go wide-eyed, and then he would give a frowning look. It was quite obvious he would be helpless without those ray ban frames.    </p><p> </p><p>If you saw "scary movie 2" it reminded me of the scene when the girl took the guy in the wheelchair glasses off and how his eyes began to roll.

<p><b>GreginColo </b>&nbsp;22 Jan 2018, 00:07</p><p>An observation and a sighting. </p><p> </p><p>Observation:  I was at a conference this past weekend that had an attendance of about 1000, with a variety of age ranges and genders.  The most predominate group was probably younger guys,I am guessing 18-30 age range, various nationalities, but to me what seemed like a surprising number of myopic guys wearing glasses, with mild to moderate Rxs, and a couple of over the top Rxs.  Of course they were mostly in fashionable frames of various colors, shapes, and sizes.  So my observation, or maybe more of a question, is that the younger guys may view glasses as a fashion statement or accessory, as well as a means of vision correction, hence possibly less of an interest in contacts or lasik.  In my generation being myopic, like myself, and needing to wear glasses was considered more of a personal defect, or burden, but the younger generation seems to wear their myopic correction more proudly.  Of course when I was younger, I had only one pair of glasses that I wore until they broke or I needed an Rx boost, which tended to happen every year or two. The trend today seems to be to have multiple pairs to coordinate with a particular desired look or mood.  I must mention that the nature of the conference would indicate most of these guys were gay.  Whether I would have posted about this if the population of guys was more general, I dont know.  Any thoughts? </p><p> </p><p>Sighting:  out of room and out of time so will have to postpone on that for now.  Sorry.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pyrofan</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2018, 11:17</p><p>Took a walk around Chinatown and ran into an interesting family of 4- all glasses wearers. Mum was unremarkable wearing low plus glasses. Two adult daughters wearing minus lenses- one was quite myopic (around -6) and the other around a -1.  </p><p> </p><p>Dad however was wearing an amazing pair of glasses in a non conventional way. Small thin semi rimless frames holding onto two VERY thick biconcave lenses bulging even from the front. He seemed to have good vision with them on as he often pointed things to his family. They then came over and sat on the table next to me with dad taking out his phone, lowering his glasses to the tip of his nose and shoving his phone right infront of his poor eyes to text. He readjusts his glasses every time his wife on the other side of the table speaks to him and slides them down again to use his phone.  </p><p> </p><p>His older more myopic daughter also did not just inherit his bad eyesight but also his habit as her glasses spent a lot of time on top of her head when reading her phone. </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if bifocals would work with such an extreme prescription as this man clearly needs near distance correction.  </p><p> </p><p>I'd imagine his wife needs to find his glasses for him if he drops them on the ground with his eyes being so poor and his frames being rimless.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2018, 08:48</p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>I would say at least-17. Definitely around a prescription where he might want to start looking at myodiscs. He seemed very well off so his glasses were immaculately made- no doubt equipped with the thinnest lenses and best coating available. Unfortunately, his myopia is too extreme and anyone who takes a look at this man's glasses can tell that he is practically blind. I wonder what his wife thinks of his need for thick glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Anyways, I've been in South East Asia for the last week or so and there have been so many encounters with men and women with high minus glasses. Myopia is truly rampant in that part of the world. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2018, 14:38</p><p>Amazing sighting! Do you have a guess of what his prescription was? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2018, 13:00</p><p>Another great sighting at a shopping centre today. At a women's department store there were two men in their mid 20s in conversation with each other (probably waiting for their missus) </p><p> </p><p>One of them immediately caught my attention due to the reflections from his extremely powerful prescriptive lenses. Asian, medium height with hair slicked back. He was wearing a fairly large square frame that are quite in fashion. However the trade off for being fashionable is that I can see the power rings together with the cut in of his lenses when facing him front on. Had a look from the side and his lenses stick out by quite a fair bit despite the thick frames. Obviously fairly heavy, he had to push the specs up tight to his nose a few times. He is so nearsighted I'm surprised his retinas haven't peeled off his eyes yet. </p><p> </p><p>Otherwise he was nothing special to look at. His wife/girlfriend eventually came over to him and she was gorgeous. Wonder how Mr Magoo over here ended up with her. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2018, 09:30</p><p>Great sighting earlier. Spotted a late 30s, early 40s Asian gentleman at a restaurant. Saw him head on first but I can clearly see the insane cut in from either side of his face. He was wearing rimless frame housing two thick polished lenses which looked like ice cubes infront of his eyes- probably a -15, real coke bottle glasses. This poor man must be blind! He seemed really comfortable with them though. He then hopped in his car after dinner and drove away with his wife.  </p><p> </p><p>Don't know if I'd trust rimless frames to hold lenses of that prescription. Looks like they're ready to fall out at any moment in which case this poor man would be in trouble!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2017, 08:22</p><p>I will continue to post when I see someone interesting and get a chance, and most definitely if I see this guy again! GOCer, I guess you are right about the small image size causing myopes to look closer at a phone, but it's funny because it gave the appearance that he was very myopic even with his glasses on. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo </b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2017, 06:46</p><p>My thanks also to tinyeyes for the recent sightings post.  I concur with James about missing these kind of posts when we dont see one for a while.  Since its not always easy to get a photo of a high myopic guy worth sharing with other such aficionados, the verbal sharing of such sightings is the next best thing.  I hope, tinyeyes, you see him again while shopping and share future sightings with us.  Always adds some excitement. Thanks again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GOCer</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2017, 05:42</p><p>Wearing high minus lenses makes everything you see smaller.  Through -16 glasses a 5 inch phone screen literally becomes the same size as a 4 inch screen for non glasses wearers.  We compensate by bringing the phone closer to our face. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2017, 01:41</p><p>Thanks tinyeyes for the great sighting. I miss these and wish people would post them more, but I'm definitely part of the problem. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2017, 23:26</p><p>No picture to share, but I had a pretty nice thick glasses sighting last night. We used to share those frequently here, but not so much anymore now that everyone posts pics of themselves online. I was at a grocery store, and I saw a guy who apparently worked there, but seemed to be off duty and doing a little shopping himself while in uniform. He was tall and a bit stocky, with nice dark wavy hair, maybe in his late 20s, rather Clark Kent-like in that regard, actually, and his glasses didn't disappoint. He was wearing big black frames that were way too large for his high RX, which, when I saw them from the front, had such a deep cut-in that they seemed to be cutting his face nearly in half! Of course, his eyes looked tiny. I would guess he was in the -11 or -12 range.  </p><p> </p><p>When I saw him, he was pausing in his shopping to read something on his cell phone, and was peering at it closely with the phone about 4 inches from his eyes... so close he could possibly have read it without those strong lenses, but he was looking through the lenses! I wonder why some myopes have this habit, although I'm not complaining because it only enhanced his nerdy sexiness seeing him peer Magoo-like at the phone. Maybe without his glasses the phone would have been an inch from his eye. Since he seems to work there, I hope I get a chance to see him again.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2017, 09:26</p><p>Thanks Andy for your response to his Rx, I think you are likely right high 20's at least.  And thanks for your first hand experience explanation of why is is holding the phone close, makes sense now that you mention it.  If you are inclined to more chat about the subject, let me know.  Thanks.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>andy</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2017, 07:49</p><p>Greg and James , I would think his Rx is late twenties, maybe more. He is holding the phone close as what he sees is so small and this gives the best view possible. I've had the same problem all my life, crisp image just often too small to be of any use.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2017, 21:23</p><p>I agree James, the recent post on GWTG is incredible, certainly some of the strongest lenses we have seen in a long time, and I think your Rx est is pretty close, rivaling the -27 of hunky actor Jon Tyler. I also noticed how close he is holding his phone, even with his glasses on.  Sometimes you hear low to moderate myopic guys say they are blind without their glasses. This guy truly is, probably only see total blur with no correction. Hope we see more of him.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2017, 19:29</p><p>Yesterday's post on the guyswiththickglasses Tumblr is incredible. Has to be -24 diopters at least and he looks like he's still struggling to see. He's holding the phone very close to his face! Also big thick hairy arms to match! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;21 Aug 2017, 21:41</p><p>Thanks MG for the link; very nice looking guy. </p><p> </p><p>While I am here, will share a sighting of today. Was at a local DIY today buying some lumber for a project.  A couple of guys ahead of me, one older, one not as old, at checkout also had two cart of lumber.  When the younger of the two, probably mid 30 to mid 40's turned around, I saw some of the thickest myopic lenses I had seen in a long time. The frames were small so hard to tell the cut-in, but they looked like he was looking thru ice cubes. They were definately bio-concave, but with the small frames, hard to tell if they were myodiscs. The Rx was probably not above -20, but also probably not far below it. Had he been alone, I would have complimented him on his glasses, and maybe started more of a conversation, but since he was with an older gentleman I didn't want to interfere, since they were also chatting about their purchases. The ages looked like they could be father and son, but nothing else indicated that to me.  </p><p> </p><p>While their transaction was still in process, the next lane opened up, and motioned me over, wood and all, so now I was able to get a more frontal view of the myopic guy.  So hot, and when the checker asked him a question about one of his items, he held it up pretty closely to be able to answer whatever the question might have been. I doubt I will ever see him again, but certainly enjoyed the sighting. </p><p> </p><p>Lastly, welcome back to "Spexy and He Knows It" after some time away from making his weekly blog posts.  His post of today, a nearly -7 guy who mostly wears glasses, was certainly a good away to reinvigorate his blog followers.  </p><p>So thanks to everyone who takes the time and effort to make interesting and stimulating topical blogs for the rest of us to enjoy.   </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

I have attached another video of this same guy, showing us 4 pair of glasses as his Rx has increased in recent years, with various frames and lense materials. The weakest, and likely oldest pair, is what he recycled the frames for in the new higher Rx pair he shows us in the earlier posted video. It sounds like he is in his 30's but has progressive myopia which continues to progress, hence the need for continued Rx increases at an age when such progression might often have long stabilized.      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2017, 08:23</p><p>James, </p><p>Many eye conditions can cause a person to have trouble seeing small text unless they hold the item close. There are low vision conditions where it is necessary to enlarge the image on the Retina so it covers more rods and cones.  Holding the text closer might help.  </p><p>You can also be completely mislead by observing a persons actions when they are not wearing glasses.  I recently observed the young son of an acquaintance holding some text very close to read it.  He was not wearing glasses and I assumed he was nearsighted.  I asked his father if his son wore glasses, he said yes, but he had been playing outside and was pretty hard on his glasses when playing, so he was not wearing them.  Later, I saw the son wearing his glasses, they were very strong Plus with significant Astigmatism.  Even later, I found out that his prescription was +5.00 with -2.75 Cylinder. </p><p>Why did he hold the text close.  He had plenty of Accommodation at 9 or 10 and by holding the text close, the text was large enough on his Retinas to be able to make it out even with the distortion caused by the Astigmatism.  Of course he could see things MUCH better with his glasses. </p><p>Don't assume that age is the only factor in the symptoms of Presbyopia. Age is only ONE factor.  It is the most common one and it is related to the stiffening of the protein in the Crystalline Lens over time.  Another factor is the ability of the Ciliary Muscles to squeeze the Crystalline Lens to increase its plus power.  Many things can affect the Ciliary Muscles.  Extreme de-consitioning is one of them.  People with low to moderate Myopia, who do not wear their glasses to read, are not doing themselves a favor.  They are NOT exercising their Ciliary Muscles.  For their size (very tiny) they are normally the strongest muscles in the body.  However, if they don't get exercise, they get weak.   </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2017, 01:51</p><p>Pretty sure it's not presbyopia because with glasses on he keeps bringing the phone closer and closer to try see better. For presbyopia, the opposite would help. Also decades too young for presbyopia. Anyway, it's not important! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;10 Jul 2017, 20:18</p><p>https://youtu.be/gC1vypJuNOo </p><p> </p><p>1) attached is an older video by Nathan Hayward; love the reflections coming from his high minus lenses, likely flat fronts.     </p><p> </p><p>2) James I would agree with Lentifan that the guy you see on the tram is probably just needing to remove his glasses to read close, as you said, real close, in the absence of a slightly weaker reading lense. Love to see this.  Thanks for the post. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;10 Jul 2017, 15:40</p><p>James </p><p>My guess is he's just experiencing the start of presbyopia.  He can't focus properly on his phone screen with his distance prescription and finds this a strain.  So he takes his glasses off and then he's VERY myopic, so he has to hold it very close.  He just needs bifocals or varifocal lenses in his glasses.  It's quite common to see myopes looking over or under their glasses to read their phones, or taking them off.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;10 Jul 2017, 11:52</p><p>There's this late 20's/early 30's guy who rides the same tram home as me some days. He's not all that much to look at were he not a glasses wearer although he's cute to me. Bald (or shaved) head, black plastic rectangular glasses, more than a bit of a beer belly but the rest of him is skinny (ugh, I know, I'm really not selling him well). I don't want to exaggerate his level myopia. I'd say he's a -9 or -10 at the most. The thing is, he can't seem to see very well even with glasses, so perhaps he has some kind of low vision issue, or some vision issue I don't understand. Anyway, his pattern is predictable: he starts off watching something on his phone with glasses on, but with the phone held very close. The glasses have some kind of tint on them (not sure if this is some low vision cue that I'm unaware of). Anyway, at some indefinable point, the glasses-on method seems to frustrate him, and then he takes the glasses off, and holds the phone RIDICULOUSLY close and with one eye closed. While he's doing this, he takes periodic breaks and looks up, but obviously it's clear enough to me watching that at this point he can't see me watching him two metres across the tram car. </p><p> </p><p>I know I shouldn't find someone else's vision struggles a turnon, but this fetish has no logic, as most of us know. I think he also bears out the point, which I tend to forget, that glasses often don't correct people to 20/20 or even close, or that sometimes they have an issue separate from myopia that a stronger Rx just doesn't help, for whatever reason. The thing that makes me unsure is that when the glasses go back on and he looks up and into the distance, he does seem to be able to see well. So there is some kind of issue about looking at things close up - which seems like the opposite problem a young myope should have - but i have no idea what it is.  </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, I'm not wishing him to be unable to see properly, but see no harm in watching.</p><p></p><hr>

A repeat trip to the bathroom reveals that the solutions are for hard/RGP lenses. So that explains the whole no extra contacts packages. He uses a case that I traditionally associate with soft contacts, though, so that had thrown off. </p><p> </p><p>I spend a lot of the movie trying to see a contact on his eye. Looking for that wonderful visibility of the RGP lenses that is such a thrill to me. No luck! Maybe the almost black eyes, maybe the low lighting. I'm sure marcoeyes on Tumblr would be able to give a technical appraisal of why not. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, the movie ends. There's not that much sex stuff happening, bit of cuddling here and there, but we decide I will stay over anyway. He turns the bedroom light on, and JACKPOT! there are his beautiful, flat fronted thick glasses, I'd say anywhere from -9 to -11. Not a very fashion forward frame, square and wire rim, no polished edges on the lenses. I'm going to hazard a guess that this guy has never been seen in public in glasses in his adult life. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, he goes to take the lenses out, and then there is a full 3 minutes of eye rubbing in bed. I remark on the eye rubbing, trying to direct the conversation where I want it to go, and eventually we get to him volunteering he wears hard lenses (although by no means does he volunteer this information without me "massaging" it out of him). No glasses go on, and then the light goes off. When he goes to the kitchen to get some juice, I sneak a quick look through the lenses. Strong! How or why he would go get his juice without them I do not know. </p><p> </p><p>The next morning, in order to see the time, he holds his phone literally right to his face, honestly even closer than someone would if this was a fantasy I was directing, and even closes one eye. </p><p> </p><p>A bit later, still without glasses, some more eye rubbing.  It's apparent that he cannot really or see or focus even on me, still very close to him, however well he thinks he's faking it. So then, I say why don't you put the glasses on. He demures, saying he doesn't like how he looks in them etc......clearly very shy about wearing glasses. But eventually he puts them on, and I say he looks really cute in them. </p><p> </p><p>He says that he has an eye condition that means the glasses don't correct his vision well. He also says at one point that his eyes are "very weak". I can't be sure, but from what he says, it sounds like he means keratoconus. From my bit of Googling now, it seems eye rubbing definitely exacerbates the condition, and some theorise even causes it if you have the genetic predisposition. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, it is clear that he is right about the glasses not correcting his vision perfectly. He's still holding his phone very close to read things. I'm not sure if this is because of the keratoconus, or just generally the warping effect of the RGP lenses (which I infer he wears all day every day from the moment he wakes up until right before bed) rendering glasses ineffective. </p><p> </p><p>I would have loved to have spoken with him more about his glasses and vision, would love even to have said how I love guys in glasses, but my strong (and I believe correct) instinct was that this guy would NOT have been into it, so all glasses/lenses/vision related chat that I recounted above could not have lasted more than a minute or two. </p><p> </p><p>Be that as it may, this kind of thing is a total fantasy of mine - the fact that you're not expecting it and then are unexpectedly let into the secret world of glasses, albeit only briefly, just adds to the excitement and pleasure. I'm glad I now have had a real life experience of this to supplement my fantasy bank. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2017, 21:07</p><p>What a stoke of luck, James, to spot this guy again. Hopefully you will have more coincidental sighting of hi.  Thanks for sharing this.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2017, 14:54</p><p>I just saw the same guy walking in the street and his flashing high minues lenses again attracted my attention!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2017, 10:59</p><p>Sorry James, my bad, I should have reread the original post.  you sure did give us an estimate of his minus correction at -10 pr so, which I think would be in the range that would accommodate bifocals or progressives, so must just be a personal preference of his   Thanks, Greg. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2017, 07:58</p><p>Just being my pedantic self here, but I did provide an estimate and guessed -10 or maybe slightly more. So for someone in that range, clearly taking off glasses to read is not going to be a viable solution without making a spectacle of themselves (no pun intended). The guy I saw may have had some special reason for having the weaker pair for reading on him e.g. maybe his day job mostly involves reading things.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2017, 20:26</p><p>James didn't provide us a guesstimate as to what he thought the the guy's Rx might be but it could be high enough that bifocals or progressives are not available.  I think there was a post a while back from a guy who was -30 or so and had reading glasses with a slightly weaker position, say -27 or so for reading.  Now that I think about it, I knew a guy once,  who was probably over -20 but kept a second pair of weaker glasses for reading and detail work. I recall once when he set down the stronger Rx pair, while wearing the weaker pair, and couldn't recall where he set down the stronger pair so asked for some help to find them.  That was some years ago so I didn't think too much about it at the time, but now realize even with the weaker pair on, things probably got blurry for him pretty quickly.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2017, 19:14</p><p>Thanks, Cactus Jack. Yes, those reasons all make sense, but it seems to be more common than I would expect, nevertheless.  In any case, it's an interesting phenomenon to watch, so no complaints here. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2017, 16:23</p><p>tinyeyes, </p><p>People with Myopia in the -1.00 to - 3.00 range and low or no Astigmatism, will often just take off their glasses to read because they are effectively wearing built in reading glasses.  Sometimes it is for convenience.  It is harder for High Myopes to do that because without their glasses, their built in reading glasses are VERY strong.  Some people just don't like bifocals or progressives.  Also, if they need biconcave lenses, they don't have any choice, they can't do any kind of Add. </p><p>Of course, there is alway Vanity lurking somewhere.  They are concerned that other people would notice lined multifocals, but are pretty sure people won't notice that they are changing glasses to focus close.  In some ways it is like the people who want to keep their need for glasses secret, because other people won't notice them squinting at menu boards, school white or black boards, and certainly won't notice that they can't recognize best friends across the street. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2017, 15:49</p><p>Interesting post about the switching glasses. I don't think I've ever seen that before either, although I've seen high myopes take off their glasses to read (very close) many times. I was always puzzled about why someone who is already wearing glasses doesn't just get progressives so they could conveniently read, but maybe it makes them dizzy or something. With the guy you saw, James, maybe he just feels self-conscious needing to hold the material so extremely close without glasses. It's interesting that a reading correction for a high myope is really just a slightly weaker distance correction, and kind of a turn-on too! So, if he's wearing minus twelve for distance, he still needs a minus ten or eleven just to see the "distant" reading material without putting it up to his nose! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2017, 20:08</p><p>Thanks James, I hear those full personality transplants can be pretty hard on a guy, so probably better we just stick with being somewhat shy around around guys that are are so stimulating because of their myopia.  I am that way myself unless I have already engaged in a conversation with a guy and he seems friendly and willing to chat a bit, such as that with a store clerk that I shared recently.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2017, 09:36</p><p>Greg, yes the switching glasses thing is a bit weird for a high myope, but I have actually seen it before. He was with a large group of people, but even if he had been alone I would need a full personality transplant to approach a stranger and start talking to him about his glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2017, 22:11</p><p>thanks James; nice sighting you shared with us.  That was probably quite exciting, and maybe more, to watch his changing of glasses back and forth.  First time I've seen or heard of a myopic guy carrying around a second pair of glasses with  (presumably) lesser correction for reading.  Usually they just take off their glasses and read the menu, or whatever, up to their nose. Was he alone or with someone?  If he were alone, I'd be tempted, but probably not brave enough, to go strike up a conversation with him. Thanks again.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2017, 08:21</p><p>A nice sighting at a restaurant last night. A handsome tall man, anywhere from 45 to 55, in quite strong, plastic framed glasses, I'd say right around -10, or even slightly higher. He had that typical flash of flat-fronted lenses that I am so attuned to that I can spot it across a busy restaurant. </p><p> </p><p>What was interesting was that he had another pair of glasses with him for reading the menu, and he changed back and forth a few times, keeping the other pair on the table. I'm not sure why he wasn't in bifocals or progressives already; maybe he's still transitioning to that phase of life, or maybe he just prefers it this way.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2017, 23:13</p><p>Thanks te; there are quite a few pictures of him on-line, but always in glasses, so would presume he doesn't wear contacts, at least in a work setting.  Of the pics of him, about half in rectangular frames and half in an oval frames, I much prefer his look with the rectangular frames. He was on tv again tonite so I expect we will be hearing more from and about him as the travel ban debates continue.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2017, 20:48</p><p>Thanks for posting, Greg -- I wasn't familiar with him. He's handsome and quite nerdy in his glasses, even though his lenses are not super strong. Seems to be around minus 5ish, I would guess. Does he wear contacts at times?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;16 Jan 2017, 23:01</p><p>Thanks tinyeyes; yes I am also usually too shy but this guy just seemed too good to pass up an opportunity to chat about his glasses, and it worked out well as described in the original post.  I am actually getting a bit more comfortable in complimenting guys about their glasses, kind of like complimenting on their hair, or their shirt, or their vehicle or whatever.  Sometimes they just say thanks with nothing to indicate a further interest in related conversation, and sometimes they engage a bit more as did this guy.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;16 Jan 2017, 21:43</p><p>Greg, thanks for sharing your experience. That's great--good for you for talking to him and even getting a discount since you were so friendly!

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2017, 20:42</p><p>Interesting sighting today that I thought worth sharing.   Was at a retail store today where the customers are in a single que and then the next cashier to open up calls for for the next customer in line to come to their station. I wasn't paying too much attention until I was called to the cashier stand that just freed up and saw the cashier could be out of my dreams.  Middle aged guy, cute, clean cut, nice smile, and glasses that would cause an immediate reaction for me.  They were square plastic, tortise shell, with some metal accents, and myopic lenses appearing to be at least -10.  </p><p> </p><p>After a little bit of small talk I complimented him on his glasses, and he thanked me for noticing, since they cost him so much and he had just gotten them a few days earlier.  I asked him why they cost so much and he took them off and showed me the side and said he is so blind that his lenses are usually very thick, but he paid extra to get very thing lenses that were not much thicker than the side of the frame. I said they looked great, but didn't mention that I have a preference for the thicker lense look.  </p><p> </p><p>He put them back on and said he also had to pay extra for the transitions (light/dark) feature and for them being progressives fir different distances.  I asked him how the progressive feature was working for him and he said he was getting used to and it was working pretty well.  But then he took his glasses back off and put his hand about 3 inches for his face and said he still had to do that to read something very small, such as the printing on a medication package. It was so hot to see him do and describe that.  </p><p> </p><p>He put his glasses back on and continued to finish my transaction.  When he told me the total it was less than what I was expecting.  He mentioned to me that it looked like the packing of what I bought had a little damage and they could discount up to 30% for that if a customer asked for such.  He said he went ahead and gave it to me without my asking.  I thanked him for the good service and for the conversation and he said he enjoyed and wished we could chat more but there was still a que of waiting customers.   </p><p> </p><p>It was specialty store that I don't have reason to frequent too often, but will likely be stopping in there more frequently in the future, and some nice and useful memories in the meantime.     </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>      </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

He really looked great in what appeared to mid-range minus lenses in black frames. I hope we see him in glasses more often in the the future. He must normally wear contacts as he would probably not be without correction based on the look of his glasses today.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2016, 22:03</p><p>A friend of this thread who hosts the blog spexyandheknowsit has treated us from time to time with posts about Jon Tyler, the super myopic super hunk who stars in a somewhat offbeat series called Paradise University.  Despite needing high myopic correction most of his life, Jon is an accomplished actor and from what I hear, a genuinely nice guy. who has been very open to sharing about himself on the afore-mentioned blog, and hopefully we'll be seeing more of him.  The series in which he stars is evidently somewhat low budget as they are having a kickstarter fundraiser.  The link to this is on the blog, but one of the highlights is the opportunity to buy the glasses that Jon wore while seasons 1-4 was being filmed.  My recollection that these were in the high -20's, so quite enticing for those of us with this fascination.  I think in more recent days John has also started combining -20 contacts with lower powered glasses to get the rest of his needed correction.  It appears this may be the case in the video made for the kickstarter campaign. Anyway, I thought I would post this in case any of you had not seen the spexyandheknows it blog recently. It worth a look.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2016, 07:29</p><p>Patrick B, it's possible that this guy's glasses were made on the cheap. I think he just buses tables at this place, so he probably doesn't earn very much. I'm sure they're expensive enough already. He actually got new glasses recently. His old pair was really old, with the lens edges yellowing, not bevelled, and they tended to slip down a lot. His new glasses, black plastic rectangular frames, stay up much better and the edges have some bevel to them.  </p><p> </p><p>Since I too wear very thick plus glasses, I suppose I'd have an excuse to ask him about his glasses and make some suggestions. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2016, 22:27</p><p>Thanks NJ for sharing your sighting and also Patrick for your constructive response. I would love to see, and maybe even meet, a guy like this, but doubt I'll ever have that chance.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2016, 18:09</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>NJ -- Yes, that's quite a prescription you describe and could easily be in the mid-twenties.  So many optical outlets don't have the sophistication to know that there are alternative lens materials and designs which can produce a far better cosmetic and optical result.  They just produce something that fills the prescription tendered and leave it at that.  That said, he may not have been able to afford a more advanced pair of glasses, especially if he ordered them in the U.S. where the cost of Zeiss 1.9 lenses can easily top $500.  If you ever have a chance to strike up a conversation with him, you might tell him about Optical4Less in Hong Kong which specializes in well-priced myodisc lenses.  Perhaps you can say you know about these things because your brother has a high prescription like his.  Thanks for sharing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2016, 12:40</p><p>I posted this in the Sightings thread, and reposting here. </p><p> </p><p>A very unusual sighting, intended mostly for the ladies and gay guys. </p><p> </p><p>Twice now I've seen this guy who works at Tom's Bar &amp; Grill in St. Louis, who has about the worst myopia I've ever seen. I'm guessing he's in the -30 range, but the odd thing is that he does not wear myodisks. Instead, he has biconcave lenses with a severe front curve and fairly large frames, or at least much larger than he should be wearing. The edge thickness is enormous, and the power rings extend almost into the center of the lenses. He holds his head in that way people with extreme prescriptions do, tilted back and turning constantly to see. Even when he's a few feet away it's almost impossible to see his eyes, just the power rings. </p><p> </p><p>He's in his 40's, trim and fit looking, black and casually dressed. I've never talked to him, he's not a server, but he seems friendly enough. </p><p> </p><p>Just wished he were the opposite gender!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;30 Aug 2016, 15:53</p><p>For me it's a fine line. I want my guys to be ridiculously nearsighted and need crazy thick glasses to see, but then I want them to be able to see properly/well with their correction (whether glasses or contacts). When there is any sense of low vision or disability, for some reason it's an immediate turnoff to me. I know the same isn't true for many others. Obviously I'm not saying the -108 guy is visually impaired or disabled, but you'd kinda have to figure that the minification and tininess of the central lens in his myodiscs alone would make his visual acuity pretty low.</p><p></p><hr>

Thanks also Jarred for the clip of the making of a pair of glasses with an astonishing Rx greater than -100.

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;24 Aug 2016, 11:37</p><p> </p><p>Nice sighting, James!  I recently saw a very high myope who had his glasses held in place with a discrete strap which his hair pretty much covered.  I'd estimate his prescription to be in the high teens and I suspect he was having a problem with his glasses moving down his nose and then leaving him in a blur.  His glasses were very small and mildly biconcave. Not a bad-looking guy, too!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;24 Aug 2016, 02:25</p><p>A wonderful sighting at a restaurant high in the Italian Dolomites. The cashier was a dark, mid 30's Italian guy with a shaved and maybe slightly balding head. He was wearing small modified oval glasses (a bit square at the sides)in a plastic frame with some kind of tint on the lenses (i.e. darkish even inside). I knew I had hit paydirt as I walked in and saw him from behind and caught sight of his teeny tiny view of the world through the lenses.  </p><p> </p><p>I'd estimate he was somewhere from -12 to -15 (and I'm no exaggerator of Rx's). I'd be surprised if he wasn't in full-time glasses by age 5 or 6. </p><p> </p><p>Here's the part that really interests me: the temples did not fit properly over his ears! I've seen this before with high myopes, albeit rarely. The glasses were staying securely in place, but that has got to be uncomfortable. Surely in the case of a high myope, where the placement of lenses in relation to the oh so myopic eyes is super important, the issue of fit must come up when getting glasses? How are high myopes able to be dispensed glasses that don't fit their faces properly? Honestly, I'm not even being rhetorical here, I have no idea how this happens. Even if this guy wears his glasses once in a blue moon and contacts all the rest of the time (although I got no indication that this guy doesn't wear glasses all the time, i.e. none of the awkwardness and fiddling of the mostly contacts crowd), the glasses should fit his face.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2016, 06:41</p><p>DNBursky, </p><p>David, </p><p>I recognized you as a long time member and I was a bit confused by your question.  It is a valid question and I thought I had answered similar questions on several occasions. </p><p>Unfortunately, I cant keep track of every members prescription and I have given up trying.  The reason I asked your age and prescription was to get a better idea of what you experience without any vision correction and with correction, so my answer could better relate to your experience. </p><p>It is pretty obvious that the young man in the picture has significant Hyperopia and may have Astigmatism to go along with it.  Unfortunately, we dont know his prescription or if he has any other vision problems.  However, it is also obvious that he still has good accommodation range, because his glasses are single vision.  I suspect his Sphere prescription is in the +4 to +6 range, but there is no way to estimate his Cylinder correction, if any. </p><p>Hyperopia and the need to wear PLUS glasses is hard to understand, unless you understand optics in general and the optics of the eye, in particular.  It also helps if you understand how the Focus Control System (FCS) and the Eye Positioning Control System (EPCS) work together. </p><p>Almost all babies are born with Hyperopia because their eyeballs have to be small to fit inside the bony eye socket in their small head.  Fortunately, most babies have have incredible accommodation range, but it takes about a month for them to learn how to use it to compensate for their Hyperopia.  The exact process is still unknown, but there is evidence that the act of accommodation causes the production of a specific Eyeball Growth Hormone that stimulates the growth of the eyeball.  As the child grows, his eyeballs get larger and less internal accommodation is required to focus images on the eyeball.  How much or how little the eyeball ultimately grows seems to be controlled by genetics.  If the eyeball does not grow enough or there are problems with Accommodation, the FCS, or Lens development, external PLUS correction may be required at a young age.  I mentioned the EPCS above, because one of the first clues that a child is having focusing problems is an interconnection in the brain between the FCS and the EPCS.  The act of focusing can cause the eyes to converge, which is necessary to look at a close object and NOT see double.  The result of focusing effort to even focus distant objects sometimes causes the eyes to converge (cross), which is not a good thing because if there is a difference in image quality between the two eyes or if the EPCS cannot fuse the two images, the brain will select the best images and ignore the other one.  If it does this often enough, the result can be Amblyopia and permanent blindness in one eye. </p><p>If a childs eyes tend to converge, one the first things an ECP suspects, is uncorrected Hyperopia that is beyond the ability of the FCS to correct using the Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses.  Often, just correcting the fundamental Hyperopia with PLUS glasses will do two things, solve the over convergence problem and enable more Accommodation Range to be available for close focusing.  It is possible that a child will grow out of mild Hyperopia as a result of the normal growth process, but sometimes genetics doesn't let that happen and significant external PLUS correction will be required, even for comfortable distance vision, for a lifetime. </p><p>Blurry distance vision is easy to understand when Myopia is involved, but focus is focus no mater what the cause of the refractive error.  Focus distance is the distance where rays of light from objects converge to a point, ideally on the Retina.  A typical normal adult eyeball is about 1 inch or 25 mm in diameter.  Because the lens system is inset, the distance from the back of the Crystalline Lens to the Retina is about 17 mm.  If you use Sir Isaac Newtons most fundamental optics formula of Lens Power = 1000 mm / focal distance (17 mm), Lens Power needed to focus is about +58 diopters.  If the distance is less than 17mm you need more PLUS.  If the distance is more than 17 mm you need less PLUS (or MINUS lenses), to focus the images. </p><p>The most common reason mild Hyperopia is hard to understand, by those who have it, is that they are not aware that they have been using their Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses to correct it for years.  When Presbyopia starts limiting that ability, (to borrow a line from Casablanca) they are Shocked, Shocked to learn that their their better than Perfect vision is not as perfect as they thought.  Out of focus distance vision can be as blurry for an uncorrected Hyperope as for an uncorrected Myope, with two differences.  The uncorrected image for a Hyperope will appear smaller for a Hyperope than a Myope and close objects will appear blurrier.  For a Myope, close objects will be clearer. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p><p>May I also suggest this link about the eye and how it works. </p><p><a href="http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/scenario/labman3/eye.htm" target="_blank">http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/scenario/labman3/eye.htm</a> </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2016, 21:20</p><p>David, i think on one, or possibly both of his blogs, there is a way to respond back to his posts and leave him your comments and/or contact information.  Greg. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2016, 09:27</p><p>How do i contact him? </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;31 May 2016, 20:14</p><p>David; the host of Marc-o-Men (devoted to guys wearing glasses), who also has a related blog called Marc-o-Eyes (devoted to guys wearing contacts), lives in Europe and spends an incredible amount of time and effort working on his blogs for the rest of us with this somewhat unique kind of interest to enjoy, and it certainly shows in the quality of his work. He is a working guy just like most of us, but travels a lot on weekends, which is why he typically doesn't post on weekends. The quality of his blogs, and the way he themes and arranges the photos is a product of the time and attention to detail he puts into them.  My understanding is that some of the photos are ones he has actually taken but many he finds on various internet sites. He typically focuses on headshots trying to best capture the visual correction needs of the guys he is featuring. Around this time of year, he often features a Gay Pride series where he features glasses wearing guys he has photographed at various European pride events. I have never met him in person, and possibly never will due to distance, but consider him a good friend and feel very comfortable complimenting the quality of his blogs, and encouraging those of similar interests to view them.         </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;31 May 2016, 19:46</p><p>Where does the guy on marc-o-men.tumblr.com find the photos that he posts? I have tried myself and always come up empty when googling. </p><p> </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mike C</b>&nbsp;31 May 2016, 02:02</p><p>Thank you, Greg!  I checked out that Tumblr blog...Quite a few nice ones in there :-) </p><p> </p><p>And, no, I don't wear glasses myself.  That was just in the fantasy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;30 May 2016, 12:27</p><p>Mike, if you like guys with strong plus Rx's you might check out the tumblr blog Marco-o-Men.  He does a great job of presenting theme oriented series of men in glasses, and recently did one of guys with moderate to strong plus glasses.  Most of his series run a week or two, so the plus guys series was probably a month or 2 back, prior to "in your heydey", "Colton Haynes", and "broken glasses".  He does a great job of organizing and presenting his photos, so you should find some exciting plus guys for you to view after you have scrolled thru the more-recent, above mentioned themes.   </p><p> </p><p>Also on your restaurant sighting/fantasy, do you wear glasses yourself, or was that just part of the fantasy?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mike C</b>&nbsp;30 May 2016, 07:42</p><p>No, I didn't say anything to him about his glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;29 May 2016, 13:50</p><p>Thanks Mike C for sharing your sighting and fantasy; sounds very exciting, although my fantasy situation would involve minus guys of the level of Rx you mentioned, but I have seen some plus guys that have been significant turn-ons.  Did you actually mention anything to him about his glasses or was that just part of the fantasy wish?  I have gotten to be a bit braver and now actually compliment guys who I find especially attractive is their strong glasses.  Sometimes all I get is thanks but sometimes they will actually engage in some conversation about their Rx, or when they started wearing glasses, or if they ever wear contacts, etc.  When that happens it is so hot... Thanks again for sharing your excitement.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mike C</b>&nbsp;29 May 2016, 12:56</p><p>I stopped at a fast food place for lunch the other day.  I'm in my late 30's.  My cashier was a young man, probably in his 20's. He was moderately overweight, with dark curly hair, wearing a red polo shirt with a name tag (his name is Matt), beige khaki shorts...and THICK plus lenses (at least +10) in a brown medium-sized frame. </p><p> </p><p>He had what I have found to be the usual look of people in plus glasses - something that really sexually arouses me - where his glasses had slid fairly far down his nose, and he would spend quite a bit of time tilting his head up to look through them, before finally pushing them back up his nose. </p><p> </p><p>The fantasy... </p><p> </p><p>I would also be wearing thick plus glasses, around +15.   </p><p> </p><p>Me:  "Hey, I like your glasses!" </p><p>Matt:  "Oh, thanks." </p><p>Me:  "Where did you get your frames?  I'm looking for something similar." </p><p> </p><p>(And, he'd say, like, Wal-Mart, or something.  He works a minimum-wage job at a fast food restaurant, so he likely has to go the "cheap" route.) </p><p> </p><p>Me:  "Oh, nice!  Do they do your lenses there, too?  And is it pretty expensive?"  Matt:  "Um, yeah they do...and my glasses cost, like, $500."   </p><p>Me:  "Oh damn!  But that's still cheaper than mine.  I think I paid close to $1,000 for mine." </p><p> </p><p>This whole time we're chatting, smiling at each other, flirting, looking at each other through our thick plus glasses - his +10's and my +15's.  There's +25 diopters of magnifying POWER between our bare eyes! </p><p> </p><p>I give him my food order.  Then, he speaks into the microphone, and my heart just MELTS!  Hearing his deep voice booming over the PA system in the cooking area behind him, and his voice echoing throughout the restaurant! </p><p> </p><p>We go out on a dinner date.  People in the restaurant see two guys gazing flirtingly at each other through THICK magnifying glasses.  And, at the end of the night, we're passionately kissing in his car...Our glasses occasionally bumping and clicking together :-) </p><p> </p><p>After having dated women for 20 years, this is my very first gay experience.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GOCer</b>&nbsp;02 May 2016, 12:16</p><p>Longtimer, tell us more about your experiences in China.  Did you get some glasses made in your refracted -23?  What kind of lens options do they offer you in that -15 and up range?  Is it only thin hi index and myodiscs or are you able to get thick glasses?  How is the optical quality of the lenses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Longtimer</b>&nbsp;01 May 2016, 03:04</p><p>One of the best things about working in China is that the glasses are cheap as hell. Since i started here, i've been visiting various optical shops to get my new glasses, in varying powers from -15 to -40. Often, i'd go in wearing glasses over contacts and ask for a manual refraction. They would often suggest that i go through a computerised refraction which i'd refuse with some lame excuse that my eye is either sensitive to the light (if i'm wearing lower powers) or that my prescription cannot be determined by the computer (if i'm wearing higher ones). But today, i mustered enough courage to go through the computerised refraction  (which is actually what  always wanted to do). With trepidation, i sat on the chair and looked through the machine. I was armed with another excuse if halfway through, the optician mentioned something about me wearing contacts... but yet, he didn't. And i went through the entire process with a printed computerised script of my refraction at the end.. when he passed it to me, it almost felt like i was receiving a medal! my script was -22.50/-23.00.... i feel like a real myope! i wish i could post the picture of the script here to share my joy. i'm so gonna try this again!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2016, 19:03</p><p> </p><p>Some months back, tinyeyes turned us on to a web tv series called "the Outs". It was really quite good, fun to watch, especially the lead character, a myopic gay guy named Mitch, played by Adam Goldman, who appears to be in the minus 5-7 range and is quite adorable both in looks and personality. Although season 1 was made in 2013, a season 2 was promised. Well, I must have signed up to get notification for season 2, as I got notice today that Season 2 will be available March 30.  It has a $15 cost this time around to view the season but there is a discount if sign up before Mar 30.  I don't have the link handy but you can you can probably just google "The Outs" to get info on the upcoming 2nd season or view the 1st. Definitely worth the time to watch in my  opinion.            </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;22 Mar 2016, 22:20</p><p> </p><p>Thanks, tinyeyes.  Yes, he's a bit scruffy but kind of sexy at the same time. BTW, you should have seen the Latino guy I saw a couple of days ago in Santa Barbara stocking shelves at a Ralph's.  The guy was young and rather cute if a bit overweight.  That said, he had the thickest glasses I've seen in a long while.  The right lens was over 1/2 " and had to have been over -20.  The left was somewhat thinner but still around -16/-17.  Flat fronts which surprised me since I would have thought he would have had biconcave lenses or myodiscs.  Maybe that's all his insurance would pay for.  Anyway, a great sighting.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2016, 05:44</p><p>There have been a series of humorous GE tv ads recently with actor Gianmarco Soresi playing a career starting ("I'm going to change the world") nerd named Owen. He is always wearing glasses in these ads but they do not appear to be of a high Rx so not sure if they are his real glasses or not.  They are somewhat reminiscent of a similar looking actor named Kyle Helf who played a nerdy guy in some insurance commercials a while back back, but in the latter case it appears to be his real, and significant, minus Rx. Both are handsome and talented guys. Anybody else see these or have any comments?.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2016, 17:54</p><p>I want to thank all three of you. It's interesting, I find farsighted guys also interesting, but so agree with what you said. Where are you all from? I don't know where anyone on here is from, many I recall England. </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2016, 11:42</p><p>Yes. Tinyeyes and James, I think that is something that a few of us have a hope for but little expectation that it might actually happen.  Nice to think and chat about though. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2016, 07:31</p><p>Tinyeyes, that is a total fantasy of mine but it's never come close to happening [insert sad face emoji here]. The closest I've come is the unexpected discovery that a work colleague or distant acquaintance has, in all the time I've known them, been living a secret life as a high myope. Maybe one day it'll happen in my romantic life.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2016, 09:02</p><p>James,  </p><p>You're right, but I think higher myopic guys were their glasses a bit more than they used to, because it's more cool to be a "nerd" than it used to be, and because thinner lenses are available (although nothing can be done about the cut-in and "tinyeyes" effect of high minus RXs.) </p><p>But have you had the excitement of discovering that someone (maybe a date) had thick glasses you didn't know about, because you saw them in his home or he finally wore them once? I love when that happens!  </p><p>For some reason, when a guy wears his thick glasses "only at bedtime" or at home, it's way more exciting to me than if he wears them all the time. It's a special transformation that only a select intimate few get to see.  </p><p>But, it does make it harder to find the guy when you never see him in glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>HighMyopic</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2016, 16:30</p><p>Has Colin found the old glasses of his that he will mail me if he finds them?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2016, 04:03</p><p>I often find while looking through dating websites (that I'm looking through for actual dates)that I'm unconsciously trying to spot guys with glasses. </p><p> </p><p>The trend though is that online, I almost exclusively see low to moderate minus glasses. Sometimes there's a guy where some sixth sense tells me his eyes are highly myopic, but I tend to forget that for high myopes, they will 90% of the time wear contacts in daily life, and 99.9% use a photo in contacts on a dating/hookup profile. </p><p> </p><p>Of course I'm making those statistics up, but I'm guessing I'm not far wrong. I wish it was different, and it probably is changing a bit, but I think for the most part, the high myopes still restrict the use of their cock bottle glasses to before bed, or when home alone. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;02 Feb 2016, 14:46</p><p>I was having dinner in a pub in St. Louis last night and saw a guy with the strongest minus I have ever seen (and I'm pretty old), I'd guess in the -30 range! He works as the janitor/cleaner in the pub, is a thin middle-aged black guy with medium sized metal frames. HIs lenses are biconcave myodiscs, but without any beveling whatsoever. The edges must be close to 2 cm thick and are polished. </p><p> </p><p>Since he spends a lot of time bending over to get the garbage and recycling, he has to push up his glasses often. He also wore a knit hat that he pulled over his temple pieces, perhaps to help keep the glasses up. When I was leaving I noticed him sitting down and looking at his phone. He held it about 10 cm from his eyes but otherwise did not seem to be struggling to see it.  </p><p> </p><p>I would have gotten a pic but the lighting was bad and there was no real opportunity to do it discreetly.  </p><p> </p><p>I think these must have been older glasses, as no one would make a pair like this without a lot of beveling. The added weight of the carrier alone must be a real burden to this poor guy. Still, he was friendly and affable, and seemed to do ok visually.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2016, 22:17</p><p>Thanks JP for the post;  as you said, cute guy.  His glasses look also to me like a weak to moderate minus power, but hard to say for sure due, or to guess an Rx, due to lack of cut-in.

I don't go to my doctor often but whenever I do she almost always tries to get me to make an appointment with the specialist about lens implants.  The thing is that weirdly I really enjoy wearing my strong glasses.  I can wear contacts when I need to for driving etc. but the sensation of a very magnifyed distorted world with no periferal vision excites me. People managed fine in the past with these glasses and I really manage ok. My vision at the lens centre is better than most. I can see in great detail.  I also enjoy other people's reaction as they are not so common now.  Let me know if you would like to know anything specific.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>boysandtheblur</b>&nbsp;16 Jan 2016, 13:07</p><p>I had a sighting today that would have fascinated Julian! </p><p> </p><p>At the train station, I saw a guy in his late teens  skinny, slightly whippet-like but really handsome features, dark curly hair short at the sides but springing up from his head. Totally cute. He had black Wayfarer frames and an Rx of about -5  the lenses were big enough that I spotted the power rings from a long way off and of course I stood behind him to get a closer look at the minification. The lenses were very smudged and certainly powerful enough to make him a full-time wearer.  </p><p> </p><p>Then 10 minutes later he sat really near me on the train and the first thing he did was take his glasses off! To clean them? No. He rested them on his lap while he looked at his phone from about eight inches away, further than I'd expect, though gradually he moved it closer. His glasses were resting on his lap. </p><p> </p><p>Then he shoved his glasses into the pocket of his torn jeans, quite a feat given that he was sitting down and it took him a few seconds to force them in. So no wonder they were dirty... and there they stayed until I reluctantly got off the train. At one point he looked up at the station indicator inside the carriage, which was quite a long way away, and squinted fiercely.  </p><p> </p><p>It wasn't his taking his glasses off that was the surprise  it was his putting them away in a place where they could so easily get scratched, broken and even dirtier. He must hate wearing them. May he normally has contacts? Even so, I couldn't believe that a boy with such pronounced myopia would go bare-eyed. At one stage he rummaged through his bag (on the floor) for something and it took a long time. That figures...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2016, 20:11</p><p>It's interesting that the season we have been watching is from 2013,so evidently there were no seasons from 2014 or 2015.  So it's good to hear a 2016 season in process, especially great news for those of us who have quickly become obsessed with "the Outs."  Let's post here if any of us find out when or where the new season can be viewed.  As James said, a great gay themed series, but also full of life issues applicable to the more general population. Thanks again te for the introduction to the series and its characters, most especially Myopic Mitch (Adam Goldman).    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2016, 06:43</p><p>I also want to add my voice to the chorus of praise for The Outs. It's so good, and I don't think only has appeal for a gay audience. The funny parts in particular have universal appeal. </p><p> </p><p>It always surprises me when something so meritorious has to be a little seen web series while absolute junk continues to get greenlit for TV.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2016, 20:33</p><p>You're welcome. It is, isn't it? Goldman has another show called "Whatever This Is" that is equally as good, and with nearly as much gay content, but he isn't in it (at least in the episodes I've seen so far.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2016, 11:30</p><p> </p><p>Thanks, tinyeyes, for introducing us to the show.  It really is quite good.  Happy New Year.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2016, 06:31</p><p>I watched the first season of "The Outs" thanks to the the link provided by tinyeyes, and as he said high quality drama with a cast of interesting and engaging characters flowing in and out of each other's lives.  The real bonus for many of us is the lead character "Mitchell" a super cute myopic guys wearing his glasses, with their telltale myopic glint, throughout the series.  I don't recall seeing any bare-eyed, or transition shots of him, but in the final episode, there is a closeup shot of his glasses lying on the night table.  Certainly worth the time to watch if you are into myopic guys and engaging gay themed drama.  Thanks tinyeyes for sharing this guy, and series, with us.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2016, 13:25</p><p>Thanks te; what a great post of a rock solid handsome guy, looks like typically wearing his mid single digits myopic glasses.  I'll be anxious to check out the series.  If you google his name you will also find some other handsome and myopic Adam Goldman's though not quite as much so as the actor you posted.  Thanks, gb.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2016, 08:40</p><p>Can't remember if I've shared this. I think not. Check out this web TV series called The Outs. It's a very high quality show. The star and creator is a very cute guy with glasses (at least -5ish, I'm guessing) named Adam Goldman. Kinda hard to find photos, you just have to watch the show and you'll see him.  </p><p>Oh wait, here's a photo and you can google him for more. </p><p><a href="http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/adam-goldman-attends-the-the-outs-panel-during-2013-paleyfest-made-in-picture-id183196344" target="_blank">http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/adam-goldman-attends-the-the-outs-panel-during-2013-paleyfest-made-in-picture-id183196344</a> </p><p> </p><p>www.theouts.com </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2015, 06:00</p><p>Does anyone every experience the following: you see the kind of eyes that, being an OO, you're sure must be very nearsighted. It's a sixth sense, but also partly based on the eyes being large and probably having  high axial length. </p><p> </p><p>Then, you see the eyes (and the person they belong to) again, and this time they ARE wearing glasses, but in an extremely WEAK Rx. The last time this happened, I decided to think past the disappointment (for me, no glasses are better than a super low Rx, dunno why), and I came up with this: perhaps in the age we're living in, with high takeup of LASIK and even ICL surgery, particularly among our more nearsighted friends, those weak looking glasses are the margin for error, i.e. the amount of nearsightedness the LASIK or ICL didn't correct, or that the surgeon underestimated. </p><p> </p><p>This theory is definitely borne out in post-cataract surgery high myopes who often still have a little residual myopia, but I believe it's common across the refractive surgery population. </p><p> </p><p>PS - apologies if I'm posting this in the wrong thread, but I'm definitely thinking of guys in glasses here!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2015, 11:50</p><p>Thanks Apple and TE for the clarification on the airport guy.  He is certainly more myopic, and nicely so, than my my original look at him indicated.  Of course its hard to get a good front on pic of someone when you are trying to do so inconspicuosly, so we take what we can get.  </p><p> </p><p>MSK, I hadn't seen any posts on the gayglassesguysfiction blog for a long time but one did pop up today about a meeting between a -4 guy (wearing -6 correction) and a real -6 guy. It was a nice (ie hot) story and certainly caught my attention.  We need more of those to chat about.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Apple77</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2015, 06:06</p><p>It was difficult to get a clear picture under the circumstances, but in person I saw a lot of cut-in, so they seemed moderately strong. He kept adjusting them, too, so I imagined he usually wears contacts and switched to glasses for a long flight from Istanbul to New York. Maybe I'll see him around Brooklyn and get a better picture.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2015, 21:01</p><p>Thanks tinyeyes for the post of your recent locker room sighting. Certainly one of those exciting sightings many of us who read this thread look forward to.  I have had a similar sighting opportunity the in recent weeks that I was going to share and your post prompts me to take the time to do so.   </p><p> </p><p>As the gym I go to, there has been a new morning guy the last month or so.  Tall, dark (Italian look) and handsome would not be an exaggeration in any way.  He is usually cleaning up and dressing for work about the time I arrive. One morning I couldn't help to notice he was standing if front of the mirror removing contacts. I wondered if he would put on glasses right away but he didn't seem to have him there with him. So he walks over to his gym bag and kind of feels around for his glasses, which turned out to be mid range myopic, I am guessing -6 to -8 range, attractive frames which further enhanced his already good looks.   </p><p> </p><p>I've since witnessed this same routine a half dozen or so more times.  He seems to be in his contacts for working out and showering and then removing them after showering but before dressing for work. So there seems to be a couple of minutes when he bare-eyed as he walks back to his gym bag and feels around for his glasses. He doesn't seem to use a lock, so hard to know how close he would have to be to be to open a lock without his contacts.  I guess I am going to have to start getting there earlier in the morning, but the possibility of seeing him switch from his glasses to his contacts does motivate me to try and make it to the gym as many mornings as possible.   </p><p> </p><p>Thanks again te for your post.       </p><p>     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2015, 09:10</p><p>I have a sighting to report! I was at the gym yesterday morning, doing my normal workout before I go to work. When I was in the locker room, I saw this hunky handsome young Asian guy I've never seen before. He was very muscular AND wearing powerful glasses. I think he was about -9, and the glasses were on the smaller, horizontal side with black/rimless combo frames. He put a little bag on the bathroom counter, and went to use the bathroom. For some reason, I wondered if it might contain contacts, although there was no reason to think so. I was changing clothes, and then he came back out, and got a toothbrush out of the bag and some toothpaste and started brushing his teeth. He kept looking down and not in the mirror, which was good, because he didn't see me looking at him, but it made it difficult to see the "cut-in". Still, I could tell from the power rings that he was close to -10. Then, as if I had a premonition, he took a contact lens case out of the bag! He took the glasses off, hooked them on his shirt collar, and started putting in his contacts! First, he washed the area around his eyes thoroughly. Then he held the case up very close to his face to see the lenses. I was so turned on. The only thing better would have been if he were taking out the contacts and putting on the glasses instead! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2015, 19:22</p><p>The gentleman in question is really that myopic. He suffers from Sticklers, and his prescription has steadily increased. </p><p>I have been amazed how well he preforms in his profession with such extreme myopia.  Years ago I worked out how far an eye could see with different prescriptions and when I got to -70D being able to see 14.3mm without glasses I figured that there was no use going any further because the average vertex distance for glasses is about 12.5mm, S I thought that a prescription of around 70 or 75D would be about the maximum. Obviously I was wrong. </p><p>Oh, and Bobby Laurel knows the gentleman in question better than I do so maybe he can answer better than me.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2015, 13:30</p><p>Excellent point, Cactus Jack.  I've been wondering about that.  How do opticians account for vertex distance effects at extreme prescriptions?  Do they physically measure the distance between the eye and the frame, and then build their lens calculations around that?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2015, 11:50</p><p>Don't overlook Vertex Distance effects.  I suspect the standard calculations of VD effects fall apart at extreme high powers, but if they are even close, the effect would be about 9 or 10 D / mm.  It is impossible to estimate the VD, but if it is about 10 mm, the power at that the cornea would not be very high. </p><p>It is hard to tell very much about his lenses in the video, but in some ways they remind me of the small security viewers for doors.  Those viewers seem to have very high MINUS lenses and apparently the VD makes focusing pretty easy. The field of view through those is wide angle with excellent depth of field.  You typically have no difficulty seeing or recognizing who is calling. </p><p>As a photographer, he seems to specialize in "interesting" optical effects and no doubt he is very familiar about how lenses work.  Hopefully, there will be more information in the future about the glasses, Somehow, I don't think he is really all that myopic.  Maybe it is sort of Ultra GOC. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2015, 11:03</p><p>Wow!  Prior to this, the highest RX I had ever heard of was -96.00.  <a href="http://www.optiboard.com/forums/showthread.php/12849-How-strong-can-glasses-be-made-This-got-me-curious" target="_blank">http://www.optiboard.com/forums/showthread.php/12849-How-strong-can-glasses-be-made-This-got-me-curious</a> </p><p> </p><p>The following year, the same customer requested stronger glasses, and Norvilles physically couldn't make them.  Interesting thing is, the new glasses RX the customer needed was -104.00.  Makes me wonder if it was the for the same guy.  If not, it's definitely quite the coincidence. </p><p> </p><p>With that prescription, the image minification is 104D*2%/1D = 208%.  Really big number.  Kinda hard to wrap my head around that one.  I can't even imagine what that would look like.  Assuming that he has healthy retinas and can see 20/20 in contacts, we can estimate the penalty to visual acuity that he takes due to image minification.  The rule of thumb is, you lose about 1 line of visual acuity per 25% of image minification.  I'm pretty sure this breaks down as you go up the chart.  Lines start out with 5 feet differences, then 10 feet, 20 feet, 30 feet, and finally 100 feet. </p><p> </p><p>Going strictly off the rule, 208% is a little over 200%, so he would lose 8 lines of visual acuity.  Based on this, he wouldn't even be able to see the 20/200 line.  He'd be at the 20/400 line. </p><p> </p><p>This is probably not a realistic answer.  More than likely, the rule applies to the 5 feet increments.  If we make this assumption, his visual acuity would drop by 5'*8 = 40'.  So his visual acuity would be 20/60.  Not too bad.  He wouldn't pass the vision screening at the DMV, but he might still be able to drive depending on their laws. </p><p> </p><p>The aperture on those lenses is indeed tiny but, due to the very high image minification, he probably has a pretty good visual field.  That would explain why he was able to navigate around so well. </p><p> </p><p>His eye's dimensions must be extreme.  I'm currently conducting an experiment to induce myopia.  Based on the research, the technique induce very high myopia.  The myopia was primarily due to an increase in vitreous depth, with a very small increase in axial length.  From a practical standpoint, you can only increase vitreous depth so much before you have to start increasing axial length. </p><p> </p><p>Assuming his myopia is axial in nature, 104D * 1mm/3D = 34 2/3 mm, or 3.47 cm.  3.47 cm * 1"/2.54 cm = 1.36".  So his eyes would be 1.36" too long.  When you consider that the normal eye is about an inch long, this would make his eyes 2.36 inches long, or 2.36 times the size of a normal eye.  It was interesting to see his eyes in the plano trial frames.  Despite having what should be oversize eyes, they don't appear to bulge out at all. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for posting this!  I was amazed that they could manufacture a lens of this power.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2015, 05:33</p><p>In addition to the minification, it would seem like his field of vision would be very small as the area of correction he is seeing through looks likes the size of a small coin, but yet as he leaves the shop he seems to function fairly well.  Thanks Jarred for the post(s) and comments.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jarred</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2015, 01:30</p><p>I recalled seeing other pictures on Micha's site <a href="http://public.fotki.com/Micha/guys_wearing_strong/guys_with_strong_glasses/83.html" target="_blank">http://public.fotki.com/Micha/guys_wearing_strong/guys_with_strong_glasses/83.html</a> which appears to be the same guy but with what looks like a lower power prescription. One of the comments leads you to this site where he is shown again <a href="http://www.eurooptik.sk/fotogaleria.php" target="_blank">http://www.eurooptik.sk/fotogaleria.php</a> Unfortunately there is no prescription information. </p><p> </p><p>This is obviously an extreme case and his myopia is progressing quickly even at his age. In the Essilor video I noticed that he was holding the new frames he was selecting about 2 inches from his face even with his old glasses on, so he was obviously due a new prescription! Its fascinating to think what's going on anatomically to get to -104D, his eyes must have extended massively. He's lucky not to have suffered any of the retinal issues that people with much lower prescriptions have to deal with. </p><p> </p><p>Good on him for just getting on with life. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2015, 19:01</p><p>Wouldn't the huge minification from a -104 lens make it just about impossible to really see anythin? I would think that the image seen through that lens would be incredibly small.</p><p></p><hr>

It's a great photo shoot of three male stars from the Paradise University series.  Two of these guys (Jon and Lucas) have been featured previously on SAHKI blog.  So now we have a feature with 3 myopic guys, one very mild, one moderate, and one extremely high minus Rx.  The shoot was centered around them swapping glasses, of which there are some great shots, and then talk about the experience.  Both the photos and the talk are quite stimulating. THANKS to all involved in making this happen.   </p><p> </p><p>And by the way, in the commentary, the most myopic star, Jon Tyler, talks about a scene he would like to play sometime in the future.

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;25 May 2015, 13:34</p><p>I've got a sighting story -- I went to fast food restaurant last week, and there were 3 Asian-American guys in front of me in line. I immediately noticed, even from behind in line, that one of the guys was wearing very strong glasses. I could see the thick, unpolished edges of his lenses bulging out behind his plastic frames. When he faced my direction, I saw a decent-looking guy, probably around 30 years old, with "tiny eyes" in yes, very high-minus glasses, with deep cut-in. I would say he was about -14 or -15D or so. I ended up sitting to eat so that I could see him eating with his buddies, but his diopters were working quite well, because he seemed to notice every time I looked his way! All in all a very nice sighting. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;24 May 2015, 12:28</p><p>thanks greg. i will share some sightings later, right now this,    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRY4yVTH110</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;23 May 2015, 20:50</p><p>Since there haven't been any posts to this thread recently, I thought I would share some sightings of today. </p><p> </p><p>One of the reasons I try to go to the gym fairly regularly is for the chance sightings of myopic guys. </p><p> </p><p>This Sat evening there were three there all at one time.  I had seen each of them there before but it was a real treat to see all three in the range of about 20 minutes.  I am guessing all three are in the -10 range, plus or minus a couple.   </p><p> </p><p>The first guy is Asain, likely is his late 20's or early 30's, very slender build, likely weighing no more than 140. He wears small rectangular frames, with quite a bit of reflection in his lenses, so I am guessing he has the strongest Rx of the 3.  He leaves his glasses in his locker when he showers and sometimes takes a magazine with him to the hot tub, still bare-eyed, so I imagine he keeps that magazine pretty close to his face to be able to read anything.     </p><p> </p><p>The second guy is dark complected, likely Hispanic, of a bit larger build, and also quite handsome, likely is his 40's.  He also wears smaller rectangular frames glasses but his lenses do not appear to be flat fronted as with the first guy mentioned. He also leaves his glasses in his locker when he showers, as opposed to leaving them on a counter in the dressing area.  </p><p> </p><p>The third guy is a bit younger, with light brown hair and blue eyes, He is likely late 20's or early 30's, as is about the same height as the Asian guy but has a much  fuller build. His striking blue eyes behind his strong lenses is what makes him so noticeable to me.  His glasses are the most modern of the three, more curved and with temples that run straight back and do not curve behind his ears in any way.  He also leaves his glasses in his locker when he showers.      </p><p> </p><p>As I mentioned I have seen all three on various occasions before and never without glasses, except when showering, so am guessing neither of the three wear contacts. There are a couple of other myopic guys who I see there regularly in glasses, but since I saw the three of these mentioned above all within one visit, I thought it was worth writing about.   </p><p> </p><p>Anyone else have any good myopic sightings recently?   </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

He is more myopic than I realized! I like the aviator wire rims almost as much as Cronenberg's horn rims. That style is coming back now with "hipsters", but not in a big way, at least yet. It was so common in that period, and really made for some thick lenses with strong prescriptions because of the large frame sizes. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;04 May 2015, 05:39</p><p> For a further update, From the recently posted "Glasses on the Beach" photo we do learn a little more about Josh Tigges, one that he really loves the beach, the sand, the water,everything about being at the beach.  We also learn of his strong faith and how that is such an important part of his life.  This post of his is worth reading.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;04 May 2015, 04:36</p><p>Thanks Brian , no I don't know much more about Josh other than what has been revealed to us on Spexy and He Knows It blog, and what we see of him on his YouTube musical videos.  So I don't know his age, background, or personal demographics.  But he does seem to be a genuinely nice guy with, as you mentioned a great look, enhanced ,for those of us such interested, by his glasses.  Hope we do see and learn more of him.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>briangw</b>&nbsp;04 May 2015, 03:10</p><p>Thanks again Greg. </p><p>Josh is a good looking guy, very sexy and rugged. Do you know much about him?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;03 May 2015, 19:58</p><p>Here's the link to the Josh Tigges x 4 photo mentioned below.   </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://spexyandheknowsit.tumblr.com/image/118067556870" target="_blank">http://spexyandheknowsit.tumblr.com/image/118067556870</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;03 May 2015, 19:54</p><p>Thanks to a friend of this thread, who's also the host of "Spexy and He Knows It" blog, there's another Josh Tigges photo posted there today, in case you haven't seen it already.  It shows him trying on 4 pairs of his glasses at once, so to the extent the corrections line up, he must be looking through a combined Rx of -40 or so.  It's too bad we can't see him try on each of them individually, and have a reader poll as to which pair he looks hottest in, no doubt hot in any of them, but there might be individual preferences as to the hottest. Looks like a very nice selection of frames to accent his already rugged handsomeness. Thanks "Sahki" for another fine post.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 May 2015, 06:27</p><p>Thanks for explaining. I didn't realize the meaning of sphere and now I do. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;02 May 2015, 09:27</p><p>If not specified by a label, the first number in a prescription is Sphere, the second number is Cylinder and the third number is the Axis of the cylinder.  Cylinder and Axis always go together.  You can t have one without the other. </p><p>Sphere correction is used to correct both types of Myopia, Hyperopia, and Presbyopia. Myopia and Hyperopia are caused a mis-match between the total power of the eye's lens system and the length of the eyeball.  Presbyopia is cause by loss of the Crystalline Lenses ability to focus.  Astigmatism is caused by uneven curvature of the front surface of the Cornea and is corrected with Cylinder and associated Axis. </p><p>Sphere power in lenses is determined by two things.  The most obvious one is the difference in the curvature of the front and back surface of the lens, the other is the Index of Refraction of the lens material.   </p><p>The Base Curve is a measure of the curve of the Front surface of the lens.  In low MINUS lenses the Base Curve of the lens is often PLUS or Convex because the slight curve makes reflections from the glasses, smaller and less obvious. Because the front surface is PLUS, the back surface has to have more MINUS (be more concave) to achieve the desired total MINUS power.  Remember the lens power is a function of the DIFFERENCE between the curvatures of he surfaces.  That makes the edge thicker, but in low MINUS prescriptions that is rarely an issue. </p><p>As MINUS prescriptions get higher it is often desirable to reduce the Base Curve of the front surface of the lens to keep the edge thickness of the lens down.  At some point, as the MINUS power increases, a ZERO Base Curve becomes beneficial in controlling edge thickness and beyond that a NEGATIVE Base Curve is used on the front surface, creating a Bi-Concave lens where both surfaces of the lens are Concave. </p><p>"Funny" reflections from glasses can make them unattractive and be annoying to others which makes Anti-Reflective coatings very desirable.  Many years ago they used plain glass lenses in the actors glasses and one flash of reflection from the glasses screamed FAKE glasses to the audience. You don't see it much any more because directors have learned their lessons. </p><p>I hope this long winded explanation helps. </p><p>C.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 May 2015, 07:33</p><p>Well, I screwed up again and transposed the terms. Anyway, you get what I'm saying.... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 May 2015, 07:32</p><p>Sorry, I meant to say cylinder, not sphere, but in any case, I know the only number close to 9 in my prescription at any time was the distance correction. I will say that I always have thought flat reflective fronts are a sexy look :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 May 2015, 07:29</p><p>Aren't flat, or nearly flat, fronts used sometimes for high myopic prescriptions to minimize edge thickness? That's what I've always thought. A number of years ago I had glasses that were around -8 that had very flat fronts, and I know my cylinder is nowhere near that high. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;01 May 2015, 18:25</p><p>PB, </p><p>I don't want to intrude, but cylinder correction for astigmatism is not the cause of needing flat front lenses, it is the Sphere correction. Sphere correction over about -8.00 or -9.00 is usually the place where the front surfaces become flat, but it depends, to some extent, on the lens material. </p><p>One of the prime rules for Inducing Myopia or for doing GOC is that Cylinder and Axis are copied exactly from an actual prescription without any changes.  No cylinder or axis correction is better than an incorrect one. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Prettyboy </b>&nbsp;01 May 2015, 17:20</p><p>I don't have one because I don't need glasses.  I just want to get them to wear them and see how I look in them.  I want to get Josh's exact prescription to duplicate the lenses he wears.  I Already know the kind of frames he wears and his prescription but im wondering if his lenses are flat like that due to astigmatism.  If so, then I would need to know what cylinder and axis measurements I would need to include in the prescription.  I'm thinking astigmatism correction is what makes a person's lenses flat or Plano. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;01 May 2015, 16:51</p><p>PB. Yes, JT's glasses are quite attractive and throw off some very nice reflection, so a nice look.  To help advise you to get a similar look, we would need to know your Rx.  Do you mind sharing that?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>prettyboy</b>&nbsp;01 May 2015, 12:46</p><p>Hi guys, </p><p> </p><p>So I wanna order some glasses online just exactly like Josh Tigges' prescription.  Based on the article I read about him his prescription is -10.5 and -11.00.  I really like the way his prescription looks on him.  I noticed that his glasses (lenses) are actually pretty plano-concave, like the lenses are flat and they reflect the light.  I think that so attractive when strong glasses do that.  So my question is, do you guys know if I need any other dimensions when putting in my online order achieve the same flat lenses?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2015, 05:26</p><p>Thanks TE for the post; I can't be sure if he is bare-eyed or not, but it sure looks like he might be.

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2015, 21:45</p><p>Tinyeyes: the very cute myopic wide-eyed guy from the insurance commercials is Kyle Helf.  He is an actor &amp; cinematographer who seems to be very effective in quirky but catchy tv commercials.  There are a number of others that feature him besides the insurance commercials, but I couldn't get them to load, so maybe someone else can. Sometimes he is in his glasses and sometimes bare-eyed, so most likely wearing contacts. Despite the strength of his glasses, he seems to have a very wide-eyed, awestruck look in many of his commercials, and he portrays this "wide-eyed, surprised" look so very well.  Hope we see more of him...   </p><p></p><hr>

I think he is the same guy we saw in another insurance commercial some while back, where he was backing out of his driveway and bumped into his trash cans.  There were some really adorable shots of him in that video, which someone, possibly Marco, and maybe also yourself, posted on their blogs. He is one of my favorites and I am thinking that is his real Rx. I don't know who he is, or if he acts anywhere else, or just appears in insurance commercials.

<p><b>brianwebber</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2015, 00:01</p><p>I think his Rx is closer to -20D. He wears the strong lenses well. For a young guy he may have further to travel along the myopia route.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ellie</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2015, 23:54</p><p>In regards to the high myopic pictures from iconosquare, I agree that they are in the -15 to -20 range.

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2015, 10:12</p><p>thanks james, for responding, feedback is very helpful in telling us when our uploads are working and when they are not, also just learning more thru sharing, i think thyago, like jey ping, went underground when the chance of exposure became to hot.....i know from my own fear, and note that word and all it impies, that i can only go so far out into the open even with my best friends, fortunatly i have one whom i can talk about anything without feeling embarrassed or inhibited....what a world it would be if we could all stand naked and totally transparent.......</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2015, 08:49</p><p>Thanks Tivo for the video. I remember that guy well and always thought he was a GOCer. The two major signs of a GOCer for me: 1) every video was glasses-centric, which doesn't gel with a person's real and genuine internet presence; and as you said 2) his Rx seemed to increase from one vid to the next in totally unrealistic amounts. </p><p> </p><p>All that said, it's still hot to watch!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2015, 04:21</p><p>I had been in touch with him for the longest while, thru face book and email, he was going to college, had done military service and was eligible for an operation for the keratosis and went a head with it came out almost as farsighted as he was nearsighted....from there after sending me some fotos of before and after, which I will try to find, he planned to get another operation to correct the first operation results...after that I lost contact......he is on Facebook thy ago Oliver's I believe, I will have to check that all out.....lastly for the longest while I began to suspect that he may be a closeted g.o.c.er inasmuch as he wound up with such thick glasses for farsightedness after being so nearsighted and how he changed glasses so quickly while being nearsighted always getting a stronger script, which I would say was in the higher teens....lastly he seemed more tha. Willing to submit fotos of himself and he made those videos with the help of  'Spexsy and he knows it', was always curiously willing to be seen in his glasses, and above all a very gracious , soul.........that's about all I know about him....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2015, 19:15</p><p>Thanks to several of you for the mention of your favorite myopic actors, definatetly both quite handsome, great actors, and significantly myopic, as judged by the cut-in the the glasses on Jake's forehead.  I agree it would be nice nice to the look of his eyes behind them.  And In the case of Joe, we have seen a number of pics of him in has glasses, certainly quite handsome. </p><p> </p><p>Another one worth a mention is super myope Jon Tyler, likely lesser known, who acts on the Pardise Uninrsiety series, and usually performs his his scenes in his glasses.  He was gracious enough to be featured on the "Spexy and He Knows It" blog last fall.   </p><p> </p><p>And just by the way, the Oscars are on as I type this and there was just a quite handsome, middle-age, significantly myopic guy in his glasses accepting an award for a foreign (Polish) film. Sorry I didn't catch his name.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2015, 08:32</p><p>Yes, I would say the young guy putting in his lenses was around a -8 or -9, if I had to guess. Did you see how he needed to put his glasses back on (very quickly) to find one of the contacts when he dropped it?  </p><p> </p><p>For actor, the two that come to mind immediately are Joe Manganiello, who is awesome in his -10ish glasses, although I'm not aware of him wearing them for a role, and of course, Jake Gyllenhaal, who is supposedly even more myopic than that, although I've never seen a picture of him in his glasses except for a tiny child photo. I still hope to see him in his glasses someday! Of course, there are others and maybe others who wear glasses on camera more, but those were my first two thoughts. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2015, 22:57</p><p>I think that may have been a sequence from a documentary called "Scared Straight" or its sequel.  The idea was to expose Juvenile Delinquents to real criminals in a prison environment to show them where their lives were headed if they continued on their present course.  I suggest you look up "Scared Straight" on Google or Wikipedia for a more detailed explanation of the goals and its successes and failures. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

Thanks again too all who maintain guys in glasses sites..  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2015, 14:37</p><p>Super myopic guy who is also in the eyewear business, discovered thanks to the great guyswglasses tumblr blog. Any guesses on RX? I'm thinking at least -13. I like the frames which are the current retro/RayBan type style, but a little smaller which is good for a high RX. Although I bet these still have some edge thickness. </p><p><a href="http://youtu.be/CDFHLTAKrCc" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/CDFHLTAKrCc</a> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Surveillance and controlled media, coupled with propaganda, that so many people can see right thru the whole scam.....but this has no place in this forum, so I will move on to what has occurred to me since watching many videos and images of g.w.g's and that is the vast difference in taste and predilection just due to age, as I was born in 1932, and probably as a result of of this my preferences for men in glasses is for real cr-39 thick power ring coated coke bottles.......all these fashion frames and retro stuff doesn't much cut it with me and high-index has really taken a lot of the fun out eye ware for me, my sig. other being around minus 8 to 10, got  laser surgery, and god bless him, I still love him and am happy for him...but when I met him he was dawned in welfare glasses and even made lower scripts look like coke bottles.....I think that's what made john and tony from tampa so appealing to me, they both have some of the thickest and strong looking lenses on the face of this planet due to welfare specs.........best joy, happiness and freedom to all for the new year......t.....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2014, 21:30</p><p>Thanks Tivo for the post(s); the thread had been kind of dormant lately so thanks for waking it back up.  As you said some nice closeups of JT. A nice closeup around 6:57; some really nice moments around 7:30 when he turns his head and you can really see the reflection and curve of his super strong lenses, and then around 8:10 to 8:20 when he starts without glasses and then puts them on; no doubt he knew exactly where they were. I haven't followed the whole series so don't know or understand all of the characters or storyline, but definitely worth a look for any Jon Tyler fans. Thanks again Tivo.     </p><p></p><hr>

I have wished so many times that victor and John both, there in tampa,  had not been so stand offish and hard to really get to know....seems like that they have both suffered some severe rejection, maybe due to wearing such strong eyeglasses....tried to let john know that I really dug his looks, but he was too introverted to ever bond on any level with anyone, other than a questionable wife he had whom he claimed had passed away a couple of years ago......victor is just plain schizo on top of it all......maybe too much Cuban coffee.........anyway that's all there is to report here in mexico....no exciting myopic men here in la manz........., jalisco.. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

There's a silly promo thing at the beginning where both have on glasses. The pair Jack wears definitely are the host's.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2014, 07:37</p><p>Mark One: thanks for drawing my attention to Jack's new Harry Potter glasses (as Finn calls them). As you say, they're unquestionably plus. I find myself wondering whether he's wearing them full time, and what Finn's Rx is. I'm a low hyperope myself and I couldn't conceivably see anything through the minus glasses he was wearing in that picture which you say were borrowed...I know identical twins don't necessarily have identical eyesight, but is it likely to be fairly similar?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark One</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2014, 00:12</p><p>Jules, the only shot I've seen of them both in glasses at the same time was on the set of some cooking show from a couple of years ago. The wire frames were borrowed from the show's very myopic host unfortunately. </p><p> </p><p>Coincidentally they posted a YouTube video on November 24 featuring Jack in a new pair of glasses. Finn even makes a comment. Unquestionably plus prescription. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2014, 05:09</p><p>Mark One: they're well worth watching! I'm interested you reckon their glasses are plus. It's really difficult to get any idea of their Rx from the Pics I've seen; but I wondered if the one with the wire frames (is that Finn?) showed a hint of minification. Then again, neither of them seems to be anything like full time in glasses, though one (Jack?) is sometimes seen wearing them out in the street. I'd be interested to know what anyone else thinks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2014, 20:56</p><p>Hi Gregg, thanks for sharing more of your visual situation with us; that does sound like a challenge to deal with the mismatched vision and having to adjust by using contacts as well as glasses. Look forward to chatting some more when convenient for you and please be aware that there are guys who would like to get to know you more, even if just by email.  Regards, Greg.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gregg</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2014, 15:53</p><p>Greg and Jamie, </p><p>Thanks guys. I really appreciated your comments. My daily relief from the pictures is lonely and one way, to get a response is awesome. </p><p>My Rx is unusual as my eyes are mismatched. My right eye is -11.5 worse than my left.For short periods in the morning and evenings I wear just spex but my vision is not the same in both eyes. During the day I wear a contact lens to balance out the Rxs. Most days I wear a minus cls in the right  and then spex on top. I have had cornea problems so alternatively I wear a plus cls in the left to increase its Rx to the same as the right. My weakest glasses are -22 both eyes, the other pair much stronger. Both sets are myos. I need glasses to correct astig and a severe squint. </p><p>I will email when I get home next week. It would be really fantastic to be in touch with similar minded guys. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2014, 08:54</p><p>I've just become aware of a very handsome pair of young guys, Jack &amp; Finn Harries, 21-year-old identical twins from London, who chronicled their gap year on Facebook and built up a huge fan base, They both seem to have glasses which one or the other is wearing in some of the pics (I don't know which of them is which). There is one shot where they're both wearing black framed glasses - one black wire and the other black plastic - and great beaming smiles.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jamie37</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2014, 06:34</p><p>Gregg,  </p><p> </p><p>You sound really cute in your rx, hopefully find someone who like your glasses and you</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2014, 22:08</p><p>Thanks Gregg for your post; yes there are a number of us who enjoy spotting guys with the reflection of strong myopic lenses and would no doubt love to see you in your glasses. If you ever want to chat some more I am gbruny@hotmail.com.   </p><p> </p><p>I also had a recent sighting while paying for a purchase at a drugstore, I put my items on the counter turned around and there was a middle age guy in small round metal frames with flat fronted strong myopic lenses,  the edges were fairly thick for such small lenses so I would guess at least -10. He is probably a guy I wouldn't have noticed too much without his glasses, but with those glasses, he quickly caught my attention. He had a really friendly smile and his tiny eyes seemed to smile also.  We chatted small talk for a minute while my purchase was finalized.  I walked slowly out the door hoping he would follow so we could chat a bit more, but he headed toward another door, so no more followup, but the memories of that sighting were useful later in the day.  </p><p> </p><p>The Thursday evening hour long episode of "House Hunters" on HGTV was also good.  A gay couple, Robert and Nathan, were house hunting in the LA area. They viewed some houses, purchased one and then embarked on a remodel. Throughout this 3 or 4 month process there were various photos of the two guys with glasses and without, about 50/50.  The taller of the the two was pretty myopic, looked flat front, and great looking both with his glasses and without.  The shorter was also very handsome but his glasses appeared to have a pretty weal Rx, either a very weak minus or possibly even a weak plus. The guys were probably in their 30's.  It was a fun segment to watch.  Regards, (also) Greg.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2014, 02:26</p><p>Had a nice sighting this morning crossing (jaywalking across, if I'm being honest) a busy road and weaving my way through gridlocked traffic. Out of the corner of my eye I saw something glinting in the sunlight. I turned to look what it was, and to my good fortune, it was a gloriously thick pair of flat fronted glasses - rather large rectangular tortoise shell frames, to be exact - sitting on the face of a cute young guy with dirty blonde wavy hair. I'm sure the lenses had a UV coating of some kind, but he was facing directly into the sun and seemed to be struggling without sunglasses (this is South Africa in summer, after all). His already tiny eyes were squinting in rather a pronounced way. </p><p> </p><p>Reading that back, this kind of description now strikes me as a bit flat in the post-Tumblr world, but I'm posting it anyway as I still enjoy reading others' sightings here.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2014, 14:31</p><p>I believe the very strong PLUS glasses may belong to the young asian man.  It appears that his left eye is turned inward, but it is extremely hard to tell for sure.  It is very likely that a person who has that much hyperopia will also experience some Esophoria or Esotropia because of the focusing effort necessary to overcome the hyperopia without his glasses. </p><p>I also thought I saw a hint of an Ultex bifocal as he moved the glasses.  It is possible that he may have had some birth defects caused by a disease such as Rubella during gestation.  It is famous for seriously affecting eye development resulting in very significant hyperopia. </p><p>He also exhibited at least one other pair of very high plus glasses. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2014, 22:21</p><p>Thanks Brandon, those are some super strong plus glasses.  Assuming they are his, that is quite unusual to see a younger Asian guy with strong plus correction; much more often it's a high, and sometimes quite high, minus correction. </p><p></p><hr>

He looked at least -10, you could see the power rings at every angle and the glasses were very thick. He couldn't have been much more than 35 but he took out his phone and I noticed he took off his glasses, the font on his screen was massive and he had it so close to his face. I felt like telling him, it must be bifocal time!! Is it normal for some people to need bifocals before they hit 40</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2014, 16:03</p><p>Thanks tinyeyes, nice post to see -20 guy and his glasses before his ICL surgery. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2014, 15:49</p><p>Perhaps this video should have posted under the "Vision" thread, which has in the past addressed issues and concerns regarding childrens' vision, as opposed to the Guys in Glasses thread, which tends to be more adult oriented. So the concern might be more the placement of the video than the content.  Just my 2 cents anyway.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2014, 20:02</p><p>David; I would agree with Julian that these appear to be fairly strong plus lenses.  The thickness of the lenses appear to be in the center, whereas with minus lenses the thickness is on the outer edges, where you see almost no thickness at the edges on this photo.  It would be interesting to see a front shot of him also, but I would be pretty sure we would see a fairly noticeable "big eyes" effect, also a characteristic of plus lenses. Just the opposite of the "tiny eyes" effect that many of us enjoy.      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2014, 11:02</p><p>David: my guess is that the lens we can see in the photo is a very strong plus; so the guy is highly hyperopic and needs his glasses to see anything at any distance - the way the lens seems to hold the light is characteristic of strong plus lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2014, 14:53</p><p>Thanks GreginColoEy for your fast food sighting.

<p><b>GreginColoEy</b>&nbsp;21 Oct 2014, 19:11</p><p>1) Thanks JP for the post of the male nurse; certainly very attractive frames on a handsome and brave guy as he prepares to return to Africa to serve Ebola patients. </p><p> </p><p>2) Tivo good to hear from you and hope you are enjoying  Mexico. I was able to open your link and view the three photo albums therein.  Thanks. </p><p> </p><p>3) Not a high myopic sighting but still one I found interesting. I was in line for a fast food lunch when a couple of guys came in, tradesmen of some sort as they wore working type uniforms with their names on them.  One guy was taller and younger, the other shorter and a bit older (probably mid-40's).  The latter was wearing some attractive safety type glasses with attractive frames and myopic lenses I would guess in the -4 or -5 range. They had enough cut in to catch my attention. After being in line for a couple of minutes he lifted his glasses and put them on top of his head. They had a slight tint to them but certainly nowhere near sunglasses, so I was curious why he took them off, especially since he was going to have to read the menu board. I was a couple of people ahead of them, but order my fries without salt so that always takes a bit longer, so I had the chance to stand there and watch them order. To see the wall menu, he leaned forward a bit and was definitely squinting, so I was wondering why he just didn't slip his glasses back down, but he didn't. My food came and I went and sat down, and soon they found a table also, with the glasses still on top of the head of the myopic guy. Had he not been with a co-worker I might have gotten up the courage to invite him to share my table.              </p><p></p><hr>

You are right, today's shots of him are so hot, so I also look forward to what the next two days will bring. This week's blog has been an incredible treat for us Jon Tyler fans.

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2014, 21:30</p><p>In case you haven't seen it already, there has been a real  treat this week on the spexyandheknowsitblog (link below). The feature guy this week is ultra myopic super hunk actor Jon Tyler, who we have seen pictures of, and admired...., in recent months and years.  </p><p> </p><p>If you have ever been a Jon Tyler fan, from his sweet Starbucks look to his tough guy mohawk look, you will want to  see this week's "Spexy" blog where Jon has some new photos, some old photos (of his early years), and a lot of great and very open commentary about his life.  The photos of him have always been so hot, but to get the opportunity to know more about him, and learn what a genuine and caring person he is, makes him all that much easier to admire, and not just for his myopic good looks.  </p><p> </p><p>Many thanks to both Jon and the blogger who contacted Jon and worked with him to create this fascinating and in"sight"ful look at this myopic superstar. There have already been 4 days of photos and commentary with 3 more to come, so most definitely worth a look if you are a fan of myopic guys (and even better with a guy as handsome and with as strong an Rx as Jon). Thanks again to both, as well as the photographer, for this great feature.           </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://spexyandheknowsit.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">http://spexyandheknowsit.tumblr.com/</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2014, 00:16</p><p>Sighting: The drugstore clerk tonight. He was tall, skinny, young (20s) and probably Armenian, I think. He was a geek and not really that cute, but his glasses made him alluring anyway! His prescription was at least -9, and his big black retro frames did nothing to hide it. Major cut-in, power rings, and thick unpolished lens edges that stuck out from behind the thick black frames. Wow. I wish I could have lingered longer, but my purchase only took a minute!  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;18 Aug 2014, 22:53</p><p>Great feature guy this week on the Spexy and He Knows It blog. Another Australia comedian who is quite handsome and willing to discuss his -12ish myopia. Interesting that he has never tried contacts and wouldn't consider laser surgery,  even though he comments he would like to not have to wear glasses.  He also talks about of some his adventures, and misadventures, while wearing, or not, wearing his glasses. It's great when guys open up like this, so let's hope we will learn and see more of him this week. Also you won't want want to miss the rock solid cut-in and power rings in his photo.  And, again thanks to the blogowner for all the work that goes into finding and sharing these guys with us. THANKS!   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2014, 14:32</p><p>Generic comment alert. </p><p> </p><p>I'm in NYC on holiday and what a great place it is for mega myopic guy sightings. I think this is partly just because there's a huge population at all times (residents and tourists) so odds of GIG sightings go up. But I also think there's a sort of ethos in NY that you don't need to wear contacts if you don't find them comfortable or it's allergy season or whatever. You just do you, even if you is coke bottle glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2014, 09:51</p><p>one of my absolute favorites....elhadji tacko fall.............https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K37ja4Vtxy0</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2014, 09:14</p><p>Thanks Dave; while some of us truly enjoy the look of thicker lenses with their more noticeable cut-in and power rings, ie the coke bottle look, many myopic wearers prefer the less impactful look of today's lense technologies, so it is good that was able to be accomplished for your friend's son.  </p><p> </p><p>Yes, life is strange where so many people wish to be less myopic, while there are those few of us who wish to be more so, or in my case to at least be where I was.  The old saying "be careful what you wish for"  applies here. </p><p> </p><p>And yes I am also a car enthusiast, primarily American cars from the mid-50's to the mid 70's, so this time of year enjoy attending car shows, and if I happen to spot a myopic guy or two in the process, all the better.  Unfortunately I have never picked up the photography and computer skills to build photo sites to share some of my sighting, cars or myopic guys, as others so artfully do. I appreciate their skills and willingness to share their photos, of both of these interests of mine. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks and best also, Greg.      </p><p>    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2014, 01:19</p><p> </p><p>GreginColorado --  I believe my friend's son continues to progress myopically, but at a reduced rate.  Even if it's only -.50 per year, that could still lead him to a prescription in excess of -12 by the time his myopia should cease, perhaps in  his early to mid twenties.  He's a cute kid (man, now, I should say) and he rarely wears contacts. His optician is to be commended since he's got him in a pair of very cool horn rim glasses (think Mad Men) that have a slightly reduced diameter and, when combined with high-index lenses, don't produce that dreaded "Coke bottle" look.   </p><p> </p><p>Sorry that you thought that the Lasik would solve the problems upstairs.  I would spend a small fortune to become seriously myopic.  Weird, isn't it, especially when I know guys who would gladly trade their myopia for my nearly perfect vision in a New York minute. And they'd probably pay me handsomely for the privilege! </p><p> </p><p>BTW, somehow I came across your Flickr page (I think) and was pleased to see that you have an interest in American cars from the 70s.  Just like tinyeyes and some of my friends here in San Francisco! </p><p> </p><p>Best, </p><p> </p><p>Dave</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2014, 14:46</p><p>Dave, one more thought here; it's fortunate, for him, that your friend's son ended up only -10 at age 18; maybe that has something to do with his parents' good vision.  I am guessing a -10 would more likely be the progression for someone who started needing correction in the 2nd or 3rd  grade, and started with an initial Rx of -2 or so.  To start with a -4 at age 3 or 4 might more commonly lead to a progression of extreme myopia, with an adult Rx in the upper teens or even beyond. But, as we know, each person is different...    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2014, 09:39</p><p>That was good Dave that you were able to spot the signs of myopia in you friend's young son, otherwise he might not have been diagnosed with such until he started school, and missed the benefits of correctable good vision during some very formative times of life, such as being able to look in the sky and see a passing plane.  It's also another example of how myopia is sometimes hereditary, but sometimesGreginColo not, as with many other characteristics of one's physical and emotional makeup. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2014, 13:49</p><p> </p><p>Funny how the genes work, isn't it.  A friend of mine and his wife (both with perfect vision) produced an adorable son who was found to be myopic at age 3.  First prescription: -4.  In fact, I was the one who suggested that he might be myopic when I was observed the way his gaze went blank when he looked across a room, and how always wanted to sit right next to the tv.  Today, at 18, he's around -10.   </p><p> </p><p>BTW, I watched some of the Paradise University episodes in which Jon Tyler plays one of the principal characters and wonder who or what is funding it. Jon is perfect as an innocent Kentucky farm boy.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sydneycider</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2014, 08:28</p><p>Jo, old as the Hills was meant to be a cryptic answer to your cryptic challenge. I have been on FB w Jon for a quite few years now. His brother and sister are myopic yes, the later only barely. His youngest brother needs no correction at all. </p><p>Cheers </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2014, 21:57</p><p>Thanks Jo, it would be interesting to know the vision history of their parents, as well as any other siblings.  I am guessing Rx of Construction Guy is fairly similar to his brother's, both amazingly strong. I would imagine both started wearing glasses before even starting school.  Thanks for the followups.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jo</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2014, 21:16</p><p>Construction guy is right. : ) </p><p> </p><p>Mohawk guy is the same person. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2014, 19:02</p><p>My initial guess was also that "mohawk myodisc guy" in the photos preceding Starbucks Jon Tyler was his brother.  But now I am thinking those "tough guy" pics are also Jon Tyler.  The reason I say this is the very small brown mole below his left cheek. It shows up closely in the myodisc forward looking shot, and also in the bare-eyed shot posted on another site just recently.  In the bare eyed shot where is also a small mole next to his right eye, which you would never notice behind his ultra thick lenses. I echo te to say "amazing" and echo Dave to say "Thanks" Jo and "keep digging", as we enjoy and appreciate your finds of highly myopic guys.  </p><p> </p><p>I am now thinking, or at least guessing, that brother may be the construction type guy with a similarly extreme Rx, who also drew a lot of interest when his pictures were first posted.        </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2014, 11:58</p><p>Oh sorry, I just saw where Jo says he's -27. How did you find that out?  </p><p>Amazing! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2014, 11:53</p><p>So, Jon is gay, but his brother is straight? I wonder what caused them to both have such high prescriptions? I know myopia runs in families, but RXs that high seem like they might be related to some other health issue. I'm more attracted to the straight brother, but they're both pretty amazing. </p><p> </p><p>By the way, when looking at Jon's FB, I can't see a list of friends. Maybe there is more than one FB account? I'm just trying to find the Asian guy you are talking about.  </p><p> </p><p>Does Jon ever say anything or post anything about his glasses or vision? The videos I watched so far treated them like they weren't there (at least the part I saw). The very, very thick "elephant in the room", so to speak.  He's got to be in the mid-20s, diopter-wise, right?  </p><p> </p><p>Thanks to all for sharing these guys!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2014, 11:34</p><p> </p><p>Keep digging, Jo!  I don't care if it's old news if it's as good as Jon Tyler.  </p><p> </p><p>I had mentioned in an earlier post that I thought I had seen Jon on Flickr:baco_1983'sPhotostream but guess that's the mystery brother.  They sure look a lot alike.  The brother, however, has gone for non-blended myodiscs with plano carriers which do nothing to hide just how unusual they are.  They look great with his mohawk and "tough guy" look. </p><p> </p><p>And Jo, you're right about scaring Jon off.  All actors like attention but he might construe this as being something that is a bit too weird.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jo</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2014, 10:59</p><p>Sorry. Previous message from me. Jo</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sydneycider</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2014, 10:31</p><p>Oh. I'm sorry for digging up old news then.  Cheers. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sydneycider</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2014, 09:58</p><p>Jo, this news is older than the hills, Jon and his bro have been around for years!!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rimless</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2014, 07:09</p><p>I have scanned every single one of his FB friends, let alone look for others with his same surname, but mine was a fruitless search.  </p><p> </p><p>I did find the Asian with myodiscs, though. Nevertheless his page was a very dull one with only his profile picture showing. </p><p> </p><p>I guess Tyler cannot wear contacts for some reason or other. There is a photo of him without the horrendously deforming lenses he has to wear and someone commented on his expression saying he looked as if he was about to sneeze. But my opinion is he was only struggling without his low vision aids, and was feeling completely out of touch with reality. In fact, I wonder what vision he can have without his glasses, or WITH them, for that matter. </p><p> </p><p>In the web series (episone 5?) there is a scene in which he is carried away from the hospital bed where he was lying without glasses for the first time, and his boyfriend has to literally take care of him has if he was a blind person. Tellingly, he kept wearing glasses even during the most intimate moments...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2014, 23:15</p><p>WOW, we have really been fortunate for so many recent posts of high myopic guys from the entertainment world; most recently Jon Tyler (Paradise Univ); Justin Heazlewood (Australian comic) and MaximNoise (German performer); and a while back Dave Labedz (comic) and Juan Alcazar (film-maker), and there may be others who I am forgetting, although guys like these are hard to forget. Each of them has myopic Rx's from mid teens to upper 20's.  I am sure each of us has our favorite of them, but they are all pretty incredible, especially in there willingness to be seen in the super strong glasses and in some cases talk about them.  Thanks much to those of you who found and shared the photos and stories of these guys. </p><p> </p><p>BTW, Jo I think I know which photo(s) are Jon Tyler's brother, but will let others also guess before I reveal mine.  Thanks.         </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jo</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2014, 21:52</p><p>For any of you with csi powers, go find his brother who is a similar script. And equally good looking. In fact, he has already be featured in ine of the photo archives recently. But I'm not gonna reveal who. Need a little work to do this but if you find it, you'll be wow absolutely wowed! </p><p> </p><p>And while doing that, please be more discreet.

<p><b>eyescene</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2014, 13:36</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jo -- Thanks!  I suspected that his prescription might be higher than -25 and now you've confirmed it.  Sometimes it's hard to tell since we don't know if he's wearing high-index 1.8/1.9) Zeiss lenses or high-index (1.74) plastic lenses.  That said, he's got quite the prescription.  I did see a couple of shots of him without glasses, and he's really quite good-looking.  I'd notice him immediately if he was walking down the street without specs. BTW, one of his Facebook friends is a cute Asian dude with blended myodiscs.  Perhaps in the -25 range.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2014, 20:38</p><p>Glad to see our friend "Spexy and He Knows It" is back with some new posts.  You need to check out his latest posts of a quite handsome -5ish young guy named Jake Regal. In addition to the blog post info and photo you can click on the link within the blog and see him playing himself, or so I presume, in some short little videos, all the ones I watched so far in his glasses. Interesting that he talks about having his prior pair of glasses for almost 10 years, during a time when I would guess he would have been experiencing some natural increases in his myopia, and maybe he did and just waited that long for an Rx change.  Anyhow, cute guy, cute videos,....worth checking out. Thanks SAHKI for the posts and links.     </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://spexyandheknowsit.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">http://spexyandheknowsit.tumblr.com/</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tivosesante</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2014, 19:19</p><p>Had still  another sighting here in Tampa this morning at the flea market, where my old illusive friend victor showed up with his thick mayo discs and both lenses as usual are in the other way around, in other words  the right is  in the left side and the left lens is in the right side, making the inner circles,farther apart, like John I still suspect that victor is a closeted g.o.c.er....having showed up in a variety of makeshift glasses and even saw him trying on reading glasses which were being distributed to homeless people....time may tell, at least he was a little more friendly and in need of money as he was trying to sell a cell phone, I could have taken advantage of the situation and lured him into a photo session....... </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tivosesante</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2014, 04:05</p><p>Had a great sighting in both Guadalajara and Mexico City on route to Tampa, fl. This past week first in Guadalajara I saw a gentleman sitting on a park bench with black retro frames all taped together to avoid falling apart....he was in his fifties I would say and fairly good looking and very physically well endowed...the lenses were barely visible, but obviously very thick and powerful, the right one being about -14 and the right one really thick and somewhere around -26........he was easy to engage in conversation and he alluded to his eyesight when I mentioned that he appeared to be in need of new glasses, saying that he was scheduled get corrective surgery...oh well........the other sighting was in a bus terminal in Mexico City last Monday, where a man in his late thirties, got off a bus and walked past me with Stella framed rectangular glasses and so thick with mayo discs on top of all of it, thati would say he had to way above -30....I up and filled him as far as the subway station entrance and from behind could see his lenses from the side and all in all I think they could have been upwards of about an inch.......he too was fairly good looking and of moderate build.....that's it!.. </p><p>.. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2014, 13:20</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hi tinyeyes -- </p><p> </p><p>I saw the handsome and very myopic cyclist in downtown San Francisco, although I saw plenty of high myopes when I was in China back in 2011.  No matter how much I tried, it was impossible to take a snap of him without appearing weird.  I did notice that whenever he wanted to look to the side, he had to turn his head so that he could look through the center of his lenses.  I'm sure he has to be a bit careful going down stairs since he can't see the stairs unless he looks straight down through his glasses.  I expect that he has a similar visual experience to somebody who has myodiscs.  Someone I used to know had myodiscs and said that he had pretty good vision, and that his transition from conventional to myodiscs wasn't a problem at all because he had long ago got used to looking through the center of his conventional lenses which afforded him the best vision.  If he looked to the side of his glasses, his view was distorted so he always moved his head more than someone with perfect vision (or vision corrected by contacts) would do.   </p><p> </p><p>The Chinese dude that GregInColorado spotted clearly has decided that wearing a fashionable frame is more important than trying to minimize the thickness/power of his lenses.  Even a small frame and high-index lenses wouldn't hide the power of his prescription.  I just wonder how heavy his current glasses are, though.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2014, 00:58</p><p>One of the other pictures of the same guy has a caption that says he is 19 years old and -20, but I agree that his glasses look even stronger than that. He's one of my favorites of that set. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2014, 14:47</p><p>hi bestshot; agree that guy you highlighted certainly does have a very strong Rx. My best guess would be right around -30, give or take a few diops either way.  I know that's not an eye chart behind him, but without those think glasses he would probably have trouble seeing anything other than what is within a few inches of his face.  Other opinions?    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2014, 02:20</p><p>Dave,  </p><p>What do you think the cyclist's RX was? Was this in China? </p><p>As for myodiscs, even though they reduce thickness, is vision better with regular lenses? It seems to vary, but from what I can tell, myodiscs seem to be worn only when RX gets to the upper teens and above. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2014, 13:58</p><p> </p><p>Jo -- It's interesting how many high myopes in China (and elsewhere) are going for full-size frames which are in vogue today.  Of course that means that their super-strong lenses have to be very thick and often myodiscs.  It's almost as if they are making a fashion statement with their thick lenses: If you've got it flaunt it. </p><p> </p><p>A couple of weeks ago I saw a very good-looking thirty-something cyclist wearing lenses that were at least 15mm thick at the edges in full-size, very expensive frames.  I'm sure they were high-index lenses, and I'm sure his optician offered him the choice of blended myodiscs to minimize the thickness.  Nevertheless, he seemed to be saying to the world that this is who I am and my thick glasses are a part of my look.  No shame there.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;26 May 2014, 09:18</p><p>Hello Tinyeyes, </p><p>  Very interesting observation.. It happened to me last year when she got up and reached in her drawer for a glasses case and said, "I hope you don't mind but these are the thickest lenses you probably will see" (she was about a -19, and frames hardly closed on the hi index lenses) Of course I just gave her a gentle kiss and said they were beautiful, like her. She normally wears about -8 and astig and uses -10 disposable contacts, but she wore her pretty blue real glasses all that day. </p><p>  Are you male or female? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;26 May 2014, 09:01</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7O581Lzrb4 </p><p> </p><p>And some think lensed -15's in stylish plastic frames. If those lenses were any thicker the arms would be catching on them when they close.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;26 May 2014, 03:21</p><p>Thanks for posting the "glasses" videos. Those are both fun to watch, particularly the first link with the -14 glasses. The deep bowls and thick edges are quite amazing.  </p><p> </p><p>I also wanted to answer the previous post about the woman who enjoys the intimacy of being around a man who reveals his glasses in private, while wearing contacts in public. I have experienced this a number of times and have posted about it here before in the past, and I love it. I have happened upon thick glasses and contact cases in bathrooms of cute men, sometimes who I was on a date with, and it was unforgettable. And nothing is better than waking up in a myopic blur with such a guy, reaching for his glasses first thing in the morning so he can find his way to the bathroom and his contacts. The more "secret" the glasses are (and of course, the stronger the minus RX and the more helpless they are uncorrected) the better. And it's like belonging to a special private club since I am a high myope myself, and it feels like we are sort of "together" with our similar vision. It's a very nice feeling.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;16 May 2014, 23:07</p><p>There was a recent post on the "What turns you on about Glasses" from a young lady named Kit to a young man named Anton. I hope they don't mind that I copied some of Kit's response to Anton below, as what she replied could also apply to a gay guy with fascination for myopic gays guys.  </p><p> </p><p>Per Kit: </p><p> </p><p>"I'm into it when a guy wears contacts during the day and then I love that hour or so before bed when he wears his glasses. It's that side of someone you only see in private...and I'm reminded of that during the day when I search people's eyes for the telltale sign of contacts. Like I'm pretty sure "normal" people don't look for that when they make eye contact with someone. So I guess it's this inner game/obsession I can keep to myself. It is super hot to be cuddling together with my vision twin and asking something like, "Can you see what time it is?" and him replying, "Not if you can't!"  </p><p> </p><p>"As for thick lenses, it's not the glasses themselves but what it's like when their glasses come off. I really like being intimate with a bare eyed myopic guy because he gives off this sort of unfocused look and our faces just gravitate closer. But it's also the mundane things like checking email on their phone in the middle of the night or reading a book with the page next to their nose. Again, I think it turns me on because it's a side of the person that most don't get to see and I like that exclusivity." </p><p> </p><p>What do think guys, do these fascinations apply just as much for gay guys as for straight women, each with a fascination for myopic guys? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;12 May 2014, 17:44</p><p>yes a lot of interesting things about him, one his ability to play so well with such high corrective lenses and I remember this morning seeing a video where he is on the court playing with no glasses for a very brief spell....will try to find the video and upload it later today.....there are in total about eight videos out there.....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tinyeyes </b>&nbsp;12 May 2014, 17:18</p><p>Very interesting young athlete! I wonder if there is a correlation between his extreme myopia and his height, since myopia is often caused by the eyeball growing too long. Also note that he wears a head strap on those glasses -- quite necessary so they won't fall off during play. I wonder if he's been able to wear contacts? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;12 May 2014, 14:53</p><p>There's a little longer vid of him on the Athletes thread.  I imagine at 16 y/o he's got some potential for more growth in his height, as well as for increase in his myopia, which often doesn't stabilize until early 20's.  His myopia must have progressed to such a high level pretty rapidly as a younger photo of him (I presume) doesn't show him in glasses.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesnte</b>&nbsp;12 May 2014, 12:39</p><p>I would say -18 to -19 otherwise he would be wearing myodiscs if it was any higher, although myodiscs might interfere with his sight while playing, I have heard that they have a different focus effect requiring a movement of the head to focus properly... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;25 Apr 2014, 16:37</p><p>Great encounter, Greg -- thanks for sharing. His RX sounds quite intriguing, but I'm sad to hear that he's not driving and able to work. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;25 Apr 2014, 00:17</p><p>Earlier this evening I encountered the most myopic guy I have ever personally run across.  My guess is his Rx is in the -30's, as his frames were very small but the lenses quite thick, so that they pretty much followed the contour of his face on the sides.  I noticed him as I was walking into a grocery store after work and he was walking out, but it was easy to spot him as significantly myopic. When I got in the store, I realized I had left my shopping list and coupons in the car, so went out to the parking lot hoping I might see the guy again.  He was fooling with a bike and backpack so I went and got the stuff from the car and as I walked back to the store he was still there, so I went up to him and asked if he was having any trouble. He said because of his poor eyesight it took him a little extra time to do things, such as unlock his bike, but he had just accomplished that.  We introduced ourselves and chatted a bit. He said he didn't drive any longer because of his vision but did enjoy riding his bike both for the exercise and to get around town, where he could stay on lower traffic streets.  He also said he was unable to work because of his eyesight so went on disability about 4 years ago. I am guessing he is in his 50's. I didn't get any feeling that he might be gay, but we exchanged names and phones numbers to possibly get grab a lunch or go on a bike ride sometime. Whether that will ever happen or not remains to be seen.                </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DaveV</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2014, 18:47</p><p>Jo, I think you are like the rest of us just Opitically Obsessed.  I see nothing wrong with that.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2014, 12:54</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yes, thanks Jo for your report.  A good number of us are simply pea green with envy! </p><p> </p><p>Nevertheless, I have managed to spot a couple of good ones here in San Francisco:  One was a mid-thirties Latino workman who was about one diopter away from plano fronts and the other a really good-looking hipster in the Mission who was wearing the slightly over-sized glasses favored by his crowd which emphasized just how strong they were.  I'd say they were easily a -11/-12 with plano fronts, super power rings and obvious lens thickness which the frames could only partially cover.  Frankly, I think he had made them a deliberate part of his look for which I was glad. </p><p> </p><p>Another sighting was an older (maybe 60ish) guy at a lecture I attended last week.  I was sitting behind him and didn't immediately notice how strong his glasses were because -- unlike the hipster -- he had everything done to minimize their obvious strength:  the temples were quite wide which hid the incredible thickness of his lenses (at least 1/2 inch) and the frames were quite small.  Nevertheless, a head on look revealed massive cut-in and major power rings.  I'd say he could easily have been in the high teens and probably should have had myodiscs.  He was constantly fiddling with them to see the screen so I suspect that he was having problems keeping them perfectly positioned for maximum effectiveness.  I never would have given him a second look if not for his glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Actually, I think I found the Latino most appealing since you don't expect someone who is part of a drywall team to be wearing such strong glasses.  Something appealing about an extremely myopic guy who isn't a professional where years of study have taken their toll. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2014, 23:06</p><p>yes, jo, that's certainly one of the nice aspects of this forum is it allows guys who have, or share, a myopic guy fascination to be true to themselves, and it's good you've been able to meet up with some like-minded guys on a one-on-one basis. Others of us, because of various constraints or inhibitions, or whatever, still only dream of such encounters.  </p><p> </p><p>But sometimes fate works in quite strange ways and you meet someone that is the person you might have always dreamed of. That recently happened to a friend of mine. Some of you may recall a 10-question myopic guy survey that I posted last fall and got 20 or so responses to.  From that survey I developed an email friendship with a guy half a world away, who at the same time had also developed correspondence with someone else, a guy of significant true myopia, who also lived half a world away.  </p><p> </p><p>The two of them eventually met in a country not home to either of them and after a week together became very close, and thereafter traveled to each others' home countries, and long story short, in less than 90-days of first meeting, they had a civil union and are now on an extended honeymoon. It's great they have the freedoms for such, and while I somewhat envy them, I also sincerely congratulate them and wish them a long and happy future, enjoying each other in many ways, but thru a connection that was initially ignited by their mutual interest in significantly myopic guys.  So whenever this thread seems to die off, the message for all of us is to keep it going in hopes that it might just help two guys of similar myopic interest, meet up like these two did and develop long-term connections.    </p><p>Thanks jo for the personal sharings you provide to this thread.     </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jo</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2014, 21:41</p><p>On this subject, i just wonder how many of you will seriously go all out to travel half a continent to meet a guy i thick glasses? say if you chatted with someone online, and they are miles away, would you just go all out to meet them, even at the mere promise of possible sex? for me, yes. in fact, i'm home away from home because i'm here at a place where there are many more myopic guys then i even have right at home. and the we are talking about high double digits. I have travelled a many times just to meet guys in thick glasses, and i admit, mostly with sex in mind. is it just me that the fetish is so strong? or am i just a slut?</p><p></p><hr>

I don't have the answer to your question about why there are so many high myopic Asian guys but it seems to be a frequent observation on this site.  Its good that Asian guys seem comfortable to be seen out and about in think lenses.  Thanks again for the sharing.      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cedric</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2014, 22:17</p><p>Travelling through Asia at present, myopia heaven. At every corner a guy in high minus glasses, usually very thick and a strong power. Many lenses are plane fronted with the magical reflection flashes in addition to the usual cut in and power rings. Several guys okay to chat about their glasses, the highest Rx so far has been a young man with -34D. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2014, 20:46</p><p>What a scary and close call for this young man, but thankfully he is okay! With his significant degree of myopia I doubt he would be doing much of anything, let alone operating power equipment, without visual correction.  Hopefully he was wearing safety glasses or goggles. The noticeable reflection thrown off from the glasses throughout the video would seem to indicate they are probably flat fronts, highlighting the significance of his Rx. Best of luck to him as he resumes his profession; I doubt I could do that.   Thanks for the video post.      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginCol</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2014, 07:51</p><p>I agree, te, that the guy is very cute and also that he must have had a high Rx fairly young to start contacts at 8 y/o.  He may have had myodiscs or if using glasses just around home may have had full frames lenses without caring too much about the thickness, ot the other attributes of such strong lenses.  Often in testimonial ads like this, they will show a before picture or at least a photo of his pre-op glassses so the veiwer can appreciate his strong Rx, although likely not as much as we (GWTG fans)would have...Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2014, 00:41</p><p>I think he's very cute. It's hard to imagine in glasses that strong. But I'll keep trying! He got contacts at 8 years old -- he must have been in very thick glasses already by then, because that's quite a young age to get into contact lenses. It sounds like he was able to wear contacts full-time and glasses were just for home/nighttime wear. I wonder if he wore myodiscs? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2014, 21:31</p><p>Thanks te for the post; too bad we didn't see a before picture with his glasses. But he seems quite pleased with the outcome, so that's what most matters.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2014, 16:55</p><p> </p><p>He'd be a lot cuter with glasses although I doubt he'd think so.  At that level of correction, his glasses would have to be at least two or three diopters over his contact lens prescription.  Oh, well, at least he's happy</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2014, 21:03</p><p>Since there seems to be a renewed interest in posting sightings, I'll share one from this morning. I was at the gym for my normal quick pre-work, mini-workout. After having showered and in the process of finishing dressing, a bearish guy (think recent post on "Even more guys..." blog) walked past me heading to the showers area. I immediately was caught by the mid range myopic glasses he was wearing, so was curious if he would take them off and leave them on the counter outside the shower area so I could get a little closer look at them. I guessed the RX in the -6 to -8 range. Unfortunately, he wore them in to the shower room and I needed to head off to work. It's kind of interesting how guys with similar seeming moderately strong Rx's treat their glasses during the after exercise cleanup process; some take them off and leave them in their locker and shower in a myopic fog and them come back to their locker and stick their nose to the lock to open it; others wear their glasses to the the dressing area but take them off leave them on the counters outside the shower room, and others keep them on even when in the shower except for when washing their face. It seems like guys usually come with their glasses on and leave with them on; only rarely anymore do I see a guy transitioning between glasses and contacts, or visa-versa. Any other good gym, or other, sightings to share?            </p><p></p><hr>

I'll try to post it, but I don't have the url - it was obviously on one of thee tumblr blog, but I can't locate it now: tumblr_m1enukmst01qa1vupo1_500.jpg</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2014, 23:01</p><p>As you said, WOW! Thanks te for capturing photos of him and sharing with the rest of us. If I had a "short-list" of dream guys, he would surely be on it, at least based on photos.   He would be a very attractive guy in any regard, but seeing his myopia like this makes him even more so. I notice he just has a hand basket rather than a cart, so maybe he shops often.  Were you able to engage him in any conversation?  THX, Greg.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2014, 17:35</p><p>WOW. I had another great sighting today, at a supermarket! I have photos on my blog here--<a href="http://guyswiththickglasses.tumblr.com/post/79800813081/" target="_blank">http://guyswiththickglasses.tumblr.com/post/79800813081/</a> </p><p> </p><p>When I walked into the store and saw this hunk (from behind) I could immediately tell his glasses were strong. Then when the turned and I saw his face and tiny eyes framed in those glasses, my heart skipped a beat. I have a hunch this guy wears contacts 90% of the time, and decided to try out his newish retro frames for a little Sunday morning errand running. His blue eyes looked decidedly shrimpy in them, but his RX was probably no stronger than -7 or -8. Enough for me, especially with that body! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2014, 14:06</p><p>James: I second tinyeyes' comments about the enjoyment from the guys you post on your new blog. Another very enjoyable site for those of us so affected with this fascination, and your commentary is great too, adding additional stimulation to the photos themselves. Thanks to both.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2014, 11:10</p><p>We are in cars too much here in California as well, James. That's why I end up having sightings in places like the bank, stores or the gym. In any case, you may not be finding that many actual sightings, but I'm certainly enjoying your virtual sightings on the "Even More Guys In Thick Glasses" blog!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2014, 03:09</p><p>Thanks for the sighting, Tinyeyes. I for one wish people did post their sightings here more often. I would post some, I just don't seem to have many noteworthy ones now that I'm in South Africa, where we're all in our cars all the time and don't come as much into contact with strangers. Also, there's a bit of a macho culture like in Australia in which guys with serious myopia are more likely to favour contacts in public.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2014, 20:58</p><p>te, sounds like quite an interesting and fun sighting at the bank; Thanks for sharing with the rest of us. Greg. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2014, 17:26</p><p>We don't post sightings here much anymore, but I had a pretty good one yesterday. I was at the bank, and saw a tall, slim, but well built 30-ish Asian guy walk in. He was wearing dark glasses, but cut-in was easily visible as he walked into the lobby from the bright street behind him. As it turned out, the bank wasn't crowded and he ended up at the teller window right next to mine. Now I could see that his glasses were the kind that get lighter as they adjust to the dimmer indoor light. So now the cut-in was clearly visible, as were the thick edges of his rimless frame glasses. He was around -7 or -8, probably, too myopic to be in a rimless but they worked well on him anyway. He also had a deep sexy voice as he asked the teller about a long dormant account or something like that. All in all, there was something very masculine and appealing yet nerdy about him, and it was one of the better sightings I've had in a while. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2014, 04:32</p><p>GreginColo - I agree - somewhere in the -5.00 to -8.00 range, and that's an rx that some of us could satisfy ourselves with. </p><p> </p><p>There have been few pics released, and some press comment that this might be deliberate.

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2014, 21:02</p><p>Tanks te for the additional photos of Edward Snowden;  not sure if these are recent on or not, but if so, it looks like he is still missing the left nose pad of his glasses as was noticed when the photos first surfaced last summer. Given his situation, I am not sure what the protocol would be for him to obtain new glasses if he wanted or needed them.  His Rx appears in the mid single digits, say maybe the -5 to -8 range.  What do others think?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2014, 11:48</p><p>Re: Snowden </p><p>I also looked for pics and found nothing when the story first broke. This picture makes it look like his RX is a little weaker than I had thought, but he's still compelling in them.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2014, 21:49</p><p>Hello guys, the next question I will put out to share involves refractive surgery.  I know there is a separate thread for this topic, but we'll keep it here as followup on some of the previous questions we've discussed.   </p><p> </p><p>1) Regarding surgery (lasik, etc)to improve your vision (ie to eliminate or reduce the need for correction): </p><p> </p><p>a) never seriously considered it </p><p>b) considered it but not a high priority </p><p>c) seriously considered it but was unable to for some reason(s) </p><p>d) had it and regret it. </p><p>e) had it and am happy with it.   </p><p> </p><p>2) Same question only this time it refers to surgery to increase the need for correction (ie the desire to wear stronger glasses): </p><p>  </p><p>a) never seriously considered it </p><p>b) considered it but not a high priority </p><p>c) seriously considered it but was unable to for some reason(s) </p><p>d) had it and regret it. </p><p>e) had it and am happy with it.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2014, 22:23</p><p>Significantly myopic American Idol contestant, John Fox, who was videoed on this thread a week or so back was eliminated in the recent group round, so we will not be seeing more of him in this context. He was without glasses in his last  round, so no doubt in contacts, but unfortunately the judges let him go. (Not a good week for John Fox, as with Denver Bronco's head coach, similarly named). And AI judge Harry Connick Jr seems to alternate between what appear to be mildly myopic glasses, and no glasses.  Certainly an attractive look either way.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2014, 10:19</p><p>I think I first heard of the Vlogbrothers, novelist John Green and his brother Hank, here on EyeScene back in 2007. They communicate regularly by video on YouTube. In a post I found yesterday, they appear together and are prompted to swop glasses (they're both reasonably myopic). I'm inclined to think each of them looks better, while seeing worse, in the other's glasses.

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2014, 15:10</p><p>Just back from the food store where it was so quiet that I had the choice of three checkouts. I chose the one with the guy with glasses, naturally, even if he wouldn't have grabbed my attention in a crowd, but hadn't intended to chat. However I figured I'd compliment him on his specs. "Cool glasses by the way. Big and funky." </p><p> </p><p>He commented that he can't stand small glasses where he can see the blur around the sides because that gives him a headache. He explained that "with my prescription everything's really blurred so I want to have big frames and be able to see". I said "I understand". </p><p> </p><p>Funnily enough for me, perhaps because I didn't see him face-to-face at first, and because he wasn't my type, I hadn't noticed the strength of his lenses in an oversize frame that he wore well with big styled hair. He could well have been -6.00. I wish I'd taken the bait and commented on my own prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2014, 09:21</p><p>THANKS: </p><p> </p><p>Julian, for the additional posts of cute, young "scientist" guy; you are right definitely a plus Rx, although I am not good at guessing the strength of such.  </p><p> </p><p>tinyeyes, for sharing your viewing of myopic comedian, including reference to his myopia in his act, hopefully an extra bit of excitement for you.  Unless of special fascination, as for those of us on this site who like to know, or at least guess, at Rx guys' levels, most people probably don't know or understand their Rx until it gets to a fairly high level; just as most of us didn't know or understand our blood pressure or cholesterol numbers until aging forces us into such awareness.      </p><p> </p><p>Thanks to both, Greg. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2014, 07:34</p><p>I've been looking at David Bursky's youtube guy, whose name is apparently Julian 8), and found him on two more videos.

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2014, 01:04</p><p>I have a sighting, but no photo to accompany it. I went this weekend to a standup comedy show. One of the comedians was a man, not bad looking, but on the older side (maybe 45-50?) , shaved head, short, with glasses. And not only did he have glasses, but he used them as part of his comedy material. His joke was along the lines of "Most people don't know the numbers of their prescription. If you know the numbers, you must be blind. I'm minus eleven! Glasses by Hubble."  His glasses very very attractive, semi-rimless, and although I noticed the minus RX right away, I never would have guessed they were that strong. It was a fun experience hearing a high myope use the glasses as part of his routine. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2014, 21:24</p><p>He looks like he's definitely wearing a plus RX. It might be fake but it's probably real, because if he has normal vision he wouldn't be able to see well with those glasses. They look fairly strong. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2014, 20:32</p><p>Hi David, in my opinion, he is certainly not near-sighted, as no signs of a minus Rx in his glasses. He is either farsighted (plus Rx), which could be why his eyes look large, the opposite effect of myopic correction, or they may just be dummy glasses for effect in the video.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2014, 06:18</p><p>I think my answer is probably 4 - fuelled by discovering EyeScene back in 1997.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jay</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2014, 22:35</p><p>#5 for sure, Greg.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2014, 15:59</p><p>For me the answer would be 3, stayed about the same. Of course, my interest/fetish increased a lot at a young age (teen years) and probably peaked in my early 20s, but then didn't change much.  I'm quite a bit older now, and while my interest has gone up and down depending on stimuli and what happened in my life, including dating highly myopic guys, it's been constant overall since my teen years. And quite strong!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bill</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2014, 15:06</p><p>In fact Greg I did think of starting with the statement about you knowing me very well!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2014, 14:42</p><p>Bill; you wouldn't have fooled me for a minute with number 1 based on what little I already know of you. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bill</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2014, 14:11</p><p>Greg, </p><p>Thought I may try to lie and say number 1. But as every picture on James' new blog has me excited then it's a number 5 for sure.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2014, 13:51</p><p>Hello Guys; sometime later last year I posted a survey of 10 questions or so to help us learn more about guys of similar fascination for guys in glasses, and also to help generate discussion of such topics of interest. For 2014, I will do it a bit different and if a questions comes to mind I will just put it on this thread one at a time, for whoever cares to answer.       </p><p> </p><p>So now I am curious, as you have gotten older, no matter what you age may be, has your interest in guys with glasses?: </p><p> </p><p>1) become much less </p><p>2) become somewhat less </p><p>3) stayed about the same </p><p>4) gotten somewhat stronger </p><p>5) gotten much stronger </p><p> </p><p>Since I should not ask a question I am not willing to answer, I would say for me 5, or at least 4. While always a strong interest to me since early grade school, I now know how much it influences my life, and how much I let it do so. Maybe because I am more open about such now that I am aware of photo blogs, discussion groups, and knowing of other guys of similar interest, I don't feel so weird about this interest as I once did, so maybe that makes it seems stronger.     </p><p> </p><p>Thoughts from other guys?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2014, 13:03</p><p>Hi MG, from what I have read about Chad Stark, his -10 or so Rx is quite real and he started needing myopic correction at quite a young age.  I think I got this from the feature on him on the SpexyandHeKnowsIt blog some months back.  I am wondering if he may have just popped on his glasses over his contacts for a photo of him in his glasses, and been eyepopingly double corrected for a brief moment.      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2014, 09:35</p><p>I certainly agree James, that tinyeyes' site is the gold standard for myopic guy sites and is what got many of us to be more open and sharing about such interest, to realize there are other guys with such fascination.  At the same time, your site also provides a new perspective with some fresh new photos of guys of different vintage. For those of us who may have such photos stashed away but don't have the talent to make a blog, would you be interested to receive those James for consideration for your blog, and if so how would we get those to you?  Thanks, greg.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bill</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2014, 04:47</p><p>James, you understand just what it is guys like us prefer to see.

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;24 Jan 2014, 12:35</p><p>It sounds like a number of us are awaiting more posts to James' new site.  As already mentioned, the lenses thickness in his first featured guy created quite the sense of excitement.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bill</b>&nbsp;24 Jan 2014, 02:39</p><p>James, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks mate for doing this.  Number one is a great start. I like the angled shots showing lens edge thickness. Brilliant. More please.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2014, 14:53</p><p>Thanks James for the suggestion that AI singer could have removed his glasses for age 6 photo, as you said commonly done in earlier times. And thanks also for the "heads up" on your new guys with glasses blog; never too many of those in my my opinion especially if they bring up new photos not yet shared.  And if your first guy with his mega Rx, (- upper teens ?) is an indication of what's to come, you will have a large following of those us who enjoy such excitement...  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2014, 13:45</p><p>Hello fellow glasses lovers, </p><p> </p><p>First thing: I wouldn't ASSUME the American Idol guy didn't have his glasses yet by 6. Remember that until the 2000's, glasses were very stigmatised, and there was a tendency for lots of people, kids included, to whip their glasses off whenever a photo was to be taken. In the case of kids, sometimes this was with the prompting of parents, and sometimes on their own steam. Many are the class photos I have where the myopes are sans glasses, staring, very blankly indeed, at the camera. </p><p> </p><p>Second, as if there were not enough already, I have decided to start my own Tumblr on the theme of guys in glasses. The first post is up, and it's located here: </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://evenmoreguysinglasses.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">http://evenmoreguysinglasses.tumblr.com/</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2014, 08:25</p><p>Thanks Julian; I noticed that also; I bet he must have started glasses pretty soon thereafter to have progressed to the Rx that he appears to currently have, which as you said is kind of hard to tell becasue of the quite reflective flat fronts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2014, 05:37</p><p>Hmm. Kind of hard to judge because of the reflections from the plano fronts - but that in itself says quite a lot. You earlier estimate of 'upper single digit' AT LEAST. This guy is pretty blind. Interesting that in the shot of him aged 6 he doesn't have glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2014, 13:59</p><p>Nice sighting, Gregincolo. What more could you ask for at the gym but to see "two otherwise nerdy, reasonably myopic guys" working out in person?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2014, 16:15</p><p>Not a great sighting; but still worth possibly worth passing on in case of interest to anyone else. Just got home from the gym and as I was there getting ready to climb onto a treadmill with a bank of tv screens in front of me, I noticed one of the screens had a photo of two younger (to me anyone under 40) nerdish guys, one Asian, one Caucasian, both in mid range myopic glasses, which caught my attention, so decided to stay tuned even though it was ESPN, where I usually don't spend too much time.  After the requisite commercial(s), I learned they were the two finalists in some kind of a national or international bowling tourney so would next be competing with one another next, so I watched that during my treadmill run (or I should admit walk).  There were some nice closeups of their faces so you could definitely notice some attractive power in their respective lenses. It was fun to see two otherwise nerdy, reasonably myopic guys in glasses, excel at a sport.     </p><p></p><hr>

Anyone have knowldge or a guess of his Rx?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2014, 08:24</p><p>Thanks James for the OKCupid post of significantly myopic guy (my guess mid teens minus) who doesn't mind talking about it or sharing photos of his eyes behind powerfully attractive lenses.  Alas, as you mentioned, too bad he is straight but his profile will likely still be enjoyed by guys from ths site. Thanks again. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks also Jo for the contact info.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2014, 22:05</p><p>Saw quite a nice sighting tonite but probably wouldn't mean too much to anyone outside of the Denver CO TV viewing market.  There's a quite handsome younger news anchor, named Kyle Clark, on NBC affiliate KUSA Channel 9.  I always wondered if he wore contacts or not, but now I know as he was on screen tonite in noticably myopic glasses, and of course looked even more handsome than normal. I was with others at the time so couldn't get a real close look to try to make a guess of his Rx, but it was noticably attractive. You can Google him and see a photo w/o glasses, but I could find no photo of him in glasses.  There are a number of guys by this name, but I think you will easily know who I mean as he is dressed like an anchor in the Google photos.          </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2014, 07:02</p><p>Thanks James for your post.I had not heard of him before either, but sounds like a very talented man.  His recap of his need for and first getting glasses was quite interesting, like many of us didn't know what we were missing out on vision wise. As you noted, there are many photos of him out there, always in glasses, so must not wear contacts.I weould guess his Rx -low teens.  And yes the frames shown in your post are the most unusual I have ever seen.  Thanks, Greg. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2013, 14:33</p><p>Agree,te, all the way around; there seems to be a consensus of the larger frames so far. It would be so fun, etc.., to help this guy pick out frames. </p><p> </p><p>And BTW if you haven't done so you might want to check out the "Spexy and He Knows It" blog.  The site owner has a special "12 Days of Christmas" stocking stuffer for us; a 12-oart story with photos.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2013, 11:11</p><p>I also like the larger frames on the myodisc guy. What's even better than being with a guy with high minus glasses? Getting to choose which frames you want him to wear! ;-) And picking the ones that make him look more handsome and also look most coke-bottle/nerdy/power-ringed/etc. </p><p></p><hr>

Both of these are quite hot, but yet with quite different looks. So a little one question survey now, for these two photos of the same guy, which is your favorite?  I know its already quite hard to choose, but I guess I prefer his look in the larger frames, but certainly quite attractive in either.  Your choice of looks?            </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2013, 12:46</p><p>Hope all who celebrate had a Merry Christmas. Just saw on TV a current but brief video clip of political activist Edward Snowden, who is of mid-range myopia and whose glasses were discussed when he first came to attention last summer.  It appears during his stay in Russia that he has not been supplied with new glasses or contacts, as they looked pretty similar to his earlier video.     </p><p></p><hr>

Maybe I had bad karma come to me for speaking out about Comfortably Zoned radio posts. Anyhow I want to use this window of opportunity to post the results of the final 2 survey questions.     </p><p> </p><p>The last two questions of the recent Guys in Glasses survey dealt with the general stimulation provided by this mutual interest in guys with glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>The first of those, #9, asks whats the biggest turn on regarding guys needing vision correction.  There were six potential responses quickly summarized as:  1) correctional dependence,  2) wishing to see thru the other guys eyes,  3) the look of his eyes behind the lenses,  4) the general transformation of his appearance,  5) the off and on, in and out transitions, and  6) the general stimulation.  There was also room for another answer which was the most popular, with 5 out of the 9 responses, where guys answered all of the above.  Additionally, the dependency aspect received 2 responses, and one each for general transformation of appearance and the overall feeling of stimulation brought on by this attraction.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2013, 07:43</p><p>Sorry - That last pub story was from me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2013, 07:43</p><p>Out at the pub pub after work yesterday where there were two guys working behind the bar who wouldnt have caught my attention but for their glasses. Ive noticed that few bar staff wear specs, which makes it all the more interesting when someone does. </p><p> </p><p>The first guy had got a medium-strong plus rx in a small plastic frame. Although I wouldnt have chosen that frame myself, he wore the prescription well and looked suitably dependent on his lenses. He could easily have looked over his specs if he simply needed to speak with a customer while looking down at the drink he was pouring, but he didnt as he wouldnt have been able to look through those lenses. The result was a greater dependence on moving his head, rather than his eyes, in order to catch the view. </p><p> </p><p>The second guy wore a somewhat hipster pair of black plastic frames; bold but rounded corners instead of the current high-fashion sharper top corners that are so popular for now. Again the frames wouldnt have had my attention but it was great to see a myopic barman at work. To improve things, he came over to my table to collect our (drinking) glasses, showing nicely-built and strong-looking arms, with a nice tattoo on his upper left arm. </p><p> </p><p>A good week for sightings and for guys who wouldn't have caught my eyes but for their spex.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2013, 07:32</p><p>A nice sighting the other evening at my local trade/hardware store. As soon as I arrived I saw that the two guys serving customers offered the choice of "Gorgeous" or "Glasses" and I felt interested in both. They use a single-queuing system so you don't know who'll serve you until you're called. Well the cuter guy had a cute jewel piercing in his left earlobe which caught my attention. But of course the guy with glasses had due attention too: His right lens had me thinking plano at first, but then I spotted a swirling low plus in his left lens which, unusually for me, I found attractive. His frames were big and bold and suited him well, as did his tattoos. He also had a piercing - a bar that passed twice through the top of his ear - which looked curved or bent, so not quite so much my thing. (Anyone else wonder about "the metal thing"? I like metal frames and metal piercing jewellery the most.)  I decided that I'd like the guys with glasses to serve me but alas, I was called by the other guy. </p><p> </p><p>However.... Having bought my bits and pieces, I realised that I'd missed an item and, with the queue having cleared, I went forward to get what I'd missed. Our guy with glasses had gone off somewhere but happily returned but (Who'd have thought it?) without specs. Well I looked at him twice, being sure that it was the same guy, and also disappointed that he'd lost his specs before serving me. Being a hardware store, it feels a bit "straight" to me, so I wasn't sure I could strike up conversation, but I realised that the change out of glasses gave me the perfect opportunity: </p><p> </p><p>"Were you wearing glasses a moment ago?" I asked. "I'm sure it was you." </p><p>"I've taken them off" came the reply, "Getting ready to go home." </p><p>"I thought you must be the same person. I'm looking for new glasses so I notice them at the moment" which, of course, was a slight lie about "the moment". </p><p> </p><p>By now I'd had a chance to read his name badge, which said "Daniel". He smiled and we went on talking, and it sounded like he'd recently got his specs. He explained that there are "different thicknesses of glasses" (by which it turned out he meant the frames rather than the lenses). He said he'd been looking for a "thin pair" but that all the frames that suited him were thick. And I have to say that these frames really did suit him. He said he'd spent a long time trying on different frames: "I tried on loads of glasses for 45 minutes before I got these." I agreed that I'd spend a long time myself, although I didn't say that I'd happily spend hours. I didn't find the courage to ask him where he'd got his specs, but enjoyed talking glasses and going out of my comfort zone in a place where I wouldn't say much that's personal. A really nice sighting. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;10 Dec 2013, 08:58</p><p>Thanks Bill; within the next day I will be posting the outcome of the final 2 survey questions, having saved the most stimulating ones till last.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;10 Dec 2013, 08:54</p><p>You are most right Julian, a better description for Dean Skye would have been "significantly" nearsighted as I would guess him close to double digits if not already there. I also like most the pics of him in the clear plastic frames.  I have not watched that full video but in the still shots it shows him sometimes in glasses and sometimes not so it would be interesting to see just when he removes his glasses as he gives a massage to another guy also named Dean. But I agree his overall look is so very interesting and arrousing.  Back for a moment to the video of him with farsighted guy, its inetersting not only how their vision is so different but also the look of their chests. I would prefer Dean Skye looks the whole way around.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Dec 2013, 06:33</p><p>Greg: Dean Skye - 'rather nearsighted'? I'd say that's the understatement of the year! Judging by the cut-in I'd say he guy is as blind as a bat. He has the most marvellous smile, dimples and all. I've had a look at several videos of him in different glasses and none, and to me the bareyed shots (or more likely in contacts) definitely lack something. There's one scene with brown plastic Armani frames, but to me the best of all shows him in clear plastic frames. To be sexy he should definitely be spexy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bill</b>&nbsp;10 Dec 2013, 01:50</p><p>Greg, </p><p>Thanks for doing this survey. It will have given many people lots of enjoyment.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2013, 22:07</p><p>This part of the summary of the Guys in Glasses survey will focus on the Rx related questions, both the correction needed by those who chose to respond with that and also our preferences for other guys that we may be, or wish to be, in contact with. </p><p> </p><p>Well start with question 5:   When comparing to yourself, to you prefer a guy needing ? </p><p>The overwhelming (11 out of 12) answer was needing more correction than oneself.  One guy responded with similar correction need to self.  No one responded that they would prefer a guy needing less correction than self or a different kind of correction (ie plus vs minus).  Thus as we probably already know, for most of us the interest is not just the frames  that are of interest, but also in the strength and power of the lenses that are needed to correct a guys, or our own, vision.  This was also confirmed by the next 2 questions.   I will draw the conclusion that for most of us a great looking guy in fake glasses is probably less attractive to us than a more plain looking guy needing a rather powerful level of correction.  Of course that is all relative to ones own level of correction.  Weve probably all heard guys in the -3 or 4 range complain that they are blind as a bat w/o their glasses or contacts.  Try telling that to a guy whose  Rx needs may be 2 or 3 or 4 or more times that.  </p><p> </p><p>That leads us into question 8: what is your own Rx and what do wish it were?  </p><p>There were 9 answers to this question and 6 of those supplied their own Rx, which went from 0 (plus readers) to -10.  Of the 9 responses, only one guy wanted to keep his present Rx.  One had a wish to switch from plus to minus.  4 guys have a desire for an Rx stronger than their own, including one guy already in double digit minus.  The remaining 3 guys have a desire to revert back to a prior but stronger correction than their present, either due to lasik, or a lessening of myopia with age.  Thus the general conclusion is that for the most part we like not only guys in strong corrections, but like that for ourselves also.      </p><p> </p><p>The question with the widest variety of answers was number  1 which asked  what need for visual correction do you prefer in a guy?   There were 12 responses to this question.  There were no responses for no correction needed or for modest nearsightedness ( ie 0 to minus 5).  There was only one response for plus correction and that was for quite significant plus (15 or greater).  The largest number of responses (4) was for moderate myopia (-5 to -10), followed by 2 for significant myopia (-10 to -15), with also 2 favoring severe myopia (-15 to -20) and 2 favoring extremely severe myopia (over -20).   Thus the preference is definitely for myopic correction, with half of us being interested in -10 or greater correctional needs on a guy. This again tells us that for those of us with this interest and who took the survey, that glasses , or contacts, are not just a fashion accessory, but rather its the real need for correction, and pretty strong at that, that brings on the rush for us.  And I have a feeling that for many of us the stronger the correction, the stronger the rush.           </p><p> </p><p>Question 2 asked if you prefer a guy in glasses, contacts or back and forth? </p><p>Of the 12 responses,  9 preferred to see a guy in glasses, 1 in contacts, and 2 switching back and forth.  We are fortunate to have some nice sites to give us some great photos and commentary for all of those, and a big thanks to those who host those, but from the results of this survey anyway, glasses rule, and that could be partially due to the visual stimulation they provide to a viewer that makes it easier to determine a guys Rx than with contacts.  More on this will follow in the final writeup of the last 2 questions.  </p><p> </p><p>Question 3 about age related near correction was probably a poorly worded question to begin with, but it still generated a full 12 responses.  Half( 6) preferred lined bifocals, 4 preferred progressive glasses,  and 2 preferred progressive contacts or adding readers as needed.   </p><p> </p><p>Thats it guys for this post, but the summary seems to be that mid to high power minus glasses are what we prefer to see on other guys, and in general what we prefer for ourselves.  The last 2 questions, which are probably truly the most stimulating, will be covered in another post. </p><p> </p><p>Please add you own commentary and thoughts as you wish, including whether this was all just a waste of time or not.  Thanks, Greg.           </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2013, 23:45</p><p>Well guys, the time that you have been waiting for (just kidding) has come. The results of the just for fun (and maybe a bit more) guys in glasses survey are in and so I will start sharing those with you.  It may take a couple or 3 posts due to site word limits and my own time limits, and also my hope to make it more interesting for you than just a series of numbers and statistics.  And a big thanks to all you of you who answered and or provided ideas and/or questions or questions. I'll try to start with the broader questions and then narrow down from there.  </p><p> </p><p>Question 7) How significant is your guys in glasses interest? </p><p>There were 9 responses to this question: 4 responded "its an addiction", and 5 responded "not an addiction, but close."  No one responded "can take it or leave it" or "wishing to quit it."  So for all of us who responded, it's an important part of who we are and how we spend our time and energy, be it on this site, some of the excellent sites of guys in glasses (or contacts) photos, or in personal communication or contact with similarly interested guys.   Of course the survey is skewed in this direction, since a guys in glasses thread is where the survey originated. A good followup question might have been to ask how "out"  are you about your guys in glasses interest. For me its always been a pretty secretive thing, and only recently have I been able to embrace this part of me and actually discuss with others, though presently limited to those who I have met on line with similar interest.  </p><p> </p><p>Question 6) at what time in your life did you become aware of guys in glasses interest? </p><p> </p><p>There were also 9 responses to this question. The most common answer with 5 responses was "in grade school". So for more than half of us this fascination has been ingrained in us since early in life. The second most common answer with 3 responses was at the other extreme, ie later in life (post college).  One response indicated middle school.  Interestingly, there were no responses for high school or college, but maybe there were other more overwhelming personal issues going on at that time of life. I am not a statistician, but I didn't see any obvious correlation between how strong an interest is (ie addiction or near addiction) and when it began. A couple of guys indicated they could clearly remember their first awareness of their interest, and that is the case for myself also. The sharing of your history is always an interesting topic for this site so please do so if you wish. </p><p> </p><p>Question 4:  Considering all aspects of a guy, how important is his need for vision correction and his need to accommodate that?  </p><p> </p><p>There were 12 responses, 8 answered "quite important and 4 somewhat important. While there are other characterists of guys that are likely important for each us, (ie facial hair vs cleanshaven, ect, Ect, ECt, ECT....), the vision correction needs of a guy ranks high or top of that list. Again this is likely skewed by the nature of the site. But  hey guys, isn't that what we all hope to find, if we haven't already?    </p><p> </p><p>That's it for now: 3 questions out of 10 summarized.  I'll be back with more, as we narrow down the nature of the questions from broad to more specific, and possibly more stimulating.  In the meantime, comments always are welcome, so please don't wait feel a need to wait until all the questions are summarized if there is something in this post that you wish to comment on. Thanks, Greg.   </p><p> </p><p>         </p><p> </p><p>        </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>       </p><p>     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gregin Colo</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2013, 18:56</p><p>Thanks David for the nice post of the two male XXX actors.  We have seen before some hot posts of Dean Skye, the rather   nearsighted one, before. I am guessing his - Rx is significantly greater than the +'s Rx.  It would be fun to watch them practicing their trade together, and see at what point, the glasses come off if they started with them on. The nearsighted guy may be wanting to see things a little more up close and personal while the farsighted guy may be using more touch and feel. And while its always hot to see guys swap glasses, and try to adjust to each others correction, in this case it would make each of their vision even much worse than uncorrected.    </p><p> </p><p>Thanks Tivo for your post also.  I don't what the guy is talking about but still a handsome, fun to watch, mid-range myopic guy.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2013, 13:21</p><p>He has a lot of ticks that make me nervous and he's a bit uncomfortable to watch.  Constantly moving around, snorting, clearing throat, and I hate when people talk in the third person.  He definitely has the gift of gab, but has an abrasive personality, and could be viewed as arrogant.  The problem with his dating life isn't his glasses; it's his personality.  He is so radical and unbalanced, he probably dosen't even let women get a word in edgewise.  Nice glasses though...    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2013, 09:45</p><p>Thanks Bill, yes the writing about such does bring that rush feeling, hence why I had such fun with the survey questions, and am sure to get an equal effect when I start to summarize the results.  I hope others might get that rush also as they answered the questions, especially the final one from tinyeyes. What a stimulating question!

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2013, 09:37</p><p>Maybe I'm weird - or maybe I'm just a different kind of weird from the rest of you! I like guys in glasses, but the lenses don't have to be all that strong to attract me. The things that interest me most are the cut-in and the minification, not so much of the guys eyes as of what I can see behind him; then the power rings. </p><p>In connection with that, a question: with lower minus prescriptions, does the background minification appear before the cut-in? Or does it all depend on the viewing angle? There's a video of Elijah Wood on YouTube wearing his glasses, alleged to be around -5, with cut-in and minification appearing and disappearing as he moves his head; see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPK5L7oboMs" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPK5L7oboMs</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bill</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2013, 08:19</p><p>Greg, We obviously understand each other totally. The writing about the experience was almost as good as the real thing. I regret now not turning to him and chatting. But yes he was very myopic and I guess would normally wear reading glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bill</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2013, 03:46</p><p>As the recent posts are talking about what we find attractive about a guy in glasses allow me to share my recent train journey experience. </p><p>On the return journey at the weekend ,midway to home, a young man, a student, got on. As he walked down the carriage the cut-in and power rings were very obvious. Not myos, but I estimate high teens Rx with full frame lenses. </p><p>He sat in the seat alongside me. No guesses  how I was feeling?!  </p><p>First he took out his phone. He pulled his glasses down his nose, peered and squinted over the top of the glasses with the phone only inches from his eyes. I was very interested now! </p><p>Next an ipad came out. He did the same again but used a zoom setting to give really big print. He held the ipad with two hands and it was so close. By now I had to force my attentions elsewhere. I carry a set of -27D myos, which I bought in Asia years ago, in my pocket. I slipped them on and just enjoyed it all! </p><p>I wanted to chat to him and let him see my myos. As quickly as he arrived he got up and got off the train. Still for fifteen minutes or so I was in heaven.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bill</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2013, 00:22</p><p>The one that really does it for me is B, the severe cut-in</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jo</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2013, 00:04</p><p>In order will be BCD, A, F, E, of which BCD are equal but generally, will be G.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2013, 23:49</p><p>Yeah, I had the feeling that "all of the above" would be a common answer! I think it's the answer for me, too, but if I had to say, cut-in and power rings are the two most telltale things I notice that instantly make my heart skip a beat, on the right guy. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2013, 23:41</p><p>Thanks Bill for the response; I think a number of us share the rush from te's great rush provoking question.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bill</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2013, 23:38</p><p>tinyeyes, it has to be response G to explain the rush I feel.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2013, 23:36</p><p>Thanks te; what a truly fascinating and stimulating  question! For those who have already taken the survey pls. also respond to this question if you wish. That will give us an even 10 questions.  And if you haven't taken the earlier two parts of the survey, pls feel free to respond to this one, and/or the earlier ones.  I think this question truly captures and encases what it is all about for many of us. I must personally respond as G, all of the above, as all of these are so intertwined for me. Its a combination of the cut-in, flash, power rings and lense thickness that initially draw my attention to a high myope guy, depending on which direction I first view him from, and then the other factors come into play. The flash/reflection and power rings is probably the easiest for me to spot from quite a distance. I also like when a high myope older guy removes his glasses and puts his eyes within a few inches of what he is trying to read, similar to the overlook effect mentioned in the question. Thanks again te for the great question, which will hopefully stimulate some stimulating conversation.          </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2013, 23:13</p><p>The talk about the eye size of the guy in the commercial brings up another survey question we could ask, for those who like minus lenses on guys: </p><p>What do you notice most about the glasses on a higher minus prescription guy? </p><p>A. How small his eyes look </p><p>B. The cut-in of the sides of his face </p><p>C. The "power rings" </p><p>D. The thickness of the lens edges and whether or not they're polished </p><p>E. Seeing how his eyes appear larger when looking over or not completely covered by the lens </p><p>F. The "flashing" effect of a flat (plano) front that's common with high minus lenses </p><p>G. All of the above </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2013, 20:01</p><p>Re the guy from the insurance commercial, what an absolutely adorable look he has, so thanks tiny eyes for posting the screen shots also. I have probably already watched that video a dozen times or so and just can't get enough of him. And I think you are right te that his eyes would look much more tiny if he were not trying to act so surprised about running into the trash cans, which I must admit to also having done. I hope that really is his Rx and they just didn't put some high power myopic glasses on a model for effect.  Then he really could see nothing but a very minified blur.  Thanks again Trent for the wonderful post.   </p><p> </p><p>Re the survey; thanks for all the responses to date; it looks like there have been no new responses for a few days so I will start summarizing this weekend as time permits and see how alike and how different we are re our guys with glasses addiction (how's that for a little preview?). Thanks again guys, Greg. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2013, 16:34</p><p>Well Trent,  </p><p>That's funny to say, but I guess you're right that his eyes appear large.  </p><p>He's definitely opening his eyes very wide for comic effect, and of course people's eyes come in all different sizes. If his eyes are on the large side, he's lucky, because his strong prescription is definitely minifying them quite a bit, based on the cut-in we see. He's at least -8 or -9, I would guess.  </p><p> </p><p>I guess my username makes it seem like I'm an expert on "tiny eyes", but it's just something I admire. I'm sure most here know this, but when eyes look smaller through a lens, it means that the person is seeing images minified just as much through the lenses, so he's seeing a sharp but "tiny" view of his world. That actually could cause problems with driving, especially if he's accustomed to wearing contacts and suddenly switches to glasses.  </p><p>Maybe that's this guy's problem. :-)</p><p></p><hr>

I think we are up to about a dozen responses now.  In a little sneak preview of the results, its almost unanimous that our guys prefer other guys who have an Rx stronger than their own, but of course that'ees all relevant to each of our current scripts which eould have been a good question to ask along with a couple of others that I think would generate some stimulating discussionm, so there msy be a round 2 of the survey for those wanting extra credit.  Stay tuned. </p><p> </p><p>And James I agree, as to the annoying irrelevance of the Comfortably Zoned Radio posts that show up on this thread, and others, of this site.</p><p></p><hr>

Most of the clips show the silver stripe at the bottom of the frame, but there are some that don't, especially near the end and it looks like there may be a couple of versions of frame w/o the silver section at the bottom.  Any guesses on his Rx?; appears to be pretty moderate.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2013, 15:14</p><p>Thanks for the video JP; what a well traveled guy and probably the most traveled pair of glasses ever; looks like he had the same pair the whole time, but hopefully took a spare with him as well, as it looks like a strong enough Rx that he wouldn't have functioned very well in this adventure had he lost or broken is glasses.

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2013, 21:31</p><p>I had a very stimulating sighting this evening that I thought worthy of sharing.  I dropped by the neighborhood grocery on the way home from work to pick up a few things that were going to go off sale today.  As I walked in, I noticed an attractive male checker that I had never seen before, made even more attractive by obviously thick and strong glasses.  So I hurried to get my purchases before he went off duty or otherwise out of the checkout counter. Fortunately he was still there so I made sure go get in his line even though there were others with fewer people. He had light brown/dark blonde hair and has an overall great look but the glasses, reminiscent of Buddy Holly style,  took him completely over the top for me. </p><p> </p><p>He seemed fairly friendly with the customer ahead of me, so I decided to compliment him on his glasses after the normal greetings between a cashier and a customer. So I said, hey man I really like your glasses and they way they look on you. He said he hasn't been able to wear his contacts recently so decided to get some new glasses. I again said that they looked great on him and he said it was just blind luck as he picked them out rather blindly as he was without any glasses or contacts when he picked them out. He just knew he wanted large scale heavy Ray-Ban plastic frames so had one of the options guide him to that section of frames.  I asked him his prescription and he quickly replied -9. I wanted to carry on the conversation but knew there were others waiting, so thanked him for his time and friendly service.  I left the store with a new found sense of stimulation and will no doubt return and hope to catch him again to see this handsome man in gorgeous and strong glasses.                </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;12 Nov 2013, 13:42</p><p>Myopic Grant, </p><p>It probably would not be very difficult or painful to remove that type IOL.  I doubt they are clever enough to roll it up and remove it through an incision like they made to insert it.  The lens fits between the iris and the crystalline lens capsule and unlike IOLs used in cataract surgery where the replacement lens fits inside the crystalline lens capsule, it is unlikely that anything, like the back membrane of the lens capsule, attaches itself to it.   </p><p>I think the lens that was installed is made of collagen to minimize chances of rejection, and it could easily be cut into strips and the pieces removed, should it be necessary. </p><p>When I had cataract surgery, I asked the doctor how they would remove my IOLs, once they unrolled, if something went wrong.  He said that they had some tiny scissors to cut up the lens so they could get it out through a small incision, but that it had to be done within a few days, before the back membrane of the capsule attached itself to the lens.  If that had occurred, then they would have to remove the lens capsule and the lens and my only choice then would be to wear very high plus cataract glasses. </p><p>I too wish they had mentioned his Rx before and after the surgery.  It would not be surprising if he did not see very clearly right after the surgery.  My vision was very good the next day after the surgery, but I had to wait 30 days to get a final Rx for my glasses.

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;12 Nov 2013, 01:26</p><p>24-year-old guy receives ICL surgery for his high myopia. We get to see him for just a fleeting moment in his thick glasses. Videos like this are bittersweet to watch, but I keep looking for them anyway. At least ICL is reversible, because it's a contact lens implanted inside the eye -- he is still just as nearsighted as ever under the contact lens. I search for ICL because it is usually used for higher prescriptions than Lasik.  </p><p><a href="http://youtu.be/K5xDpP-xoeU" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/K5xDpP-xoeU</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Krieger</b>&nbsp;12 Nov 2013, 01:10</p><p>Greetings from Hong Kong, thanks for bringing up the conversation upon our very secret fascinations. Speaking for myself I have an asorted set of fetishes: Very thick eyeglasses, men with smooth or shaved legs, feet and sandals and men that suffer from polio sequels and that have to use leg braces and crutches to move around.  </p><p> </p><p>As for this last fetish I have found that the heterosexual side is highly developed, there are even web sites promoting female models with such condition.  And where I am currently living there is a huge array of beautiful women like that. But for us gays I have found that there is no opportunity to find such men as the males who suffer that condition seldom would like to be categorized with the homosexual sector of the population.  </p><p> </p><p>You can say they don't want to be discriminated against two times.   </p><p> </p><p>Oh well. that's just me sharing some of my deepest decires. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lurking</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2013, 23:09</p><p>For me the main fetishes are very, very thick glasses and going barefoot. Preferably both at the same time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2013, 07:02</p><p>like to get in on the conversation about different fetishes, i.ll speak to my own which are three major ones, one being glasses, two boots, and three men with various disabilities, the list could go on, as for example various parts of the male body like legs, breast, not the sex organs at all ironically nor the buns, but overall the human male body I find exciting and the face is it, upon which I can with my imagination affix glasses and likewise boots to the legs.....all in all I believe fetishes are god's toys for us to play with, and the important thing is to remember who gave us these toys and be grateful and validate a higher power that so endowed us with such undying facinations........</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2013, 18:08</p><p>James and JP: although you don't exactly agree with each other, I'm inclined to agree with both of you: </p><p>1. I like guys who wear glasses; but then I also like guys with nice legs. A guy with nice legs who wears glasses is perfection! </p><p>2. I'm also turned on by the squint as a myopic guy tries to focus. And I have a photo of a young guy reading a paper, his glasses discarded on the table, and the paper just that bit closer to his eyes than normal - delicious. </p><p>Incidentally I've just been watching an old edition of the quiz programme Blockbusters which I mentioned recently on 'Julian's jottings'. the single contestant was a very handsome boy wearing minus glasses. When he had to read letters on the board there was just the hint of a squint that said he was due for a new prescription - again, delicious!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2013, 05:38</p><p>Regarding Jo's nightmare(!) prospect of a world without glasses, and James's helpful response, I don't imagine that glasses fetishists would've been sexless in a world before specs, but simply that our sexualities would have taken different forms. </p><p> </p><p>James touches on the multi-faceted nature of our interest(s): The need of the wearer, perceived dependence, the lenses, the frames, the way he uses, touches, wears and moves his specs, his intimacy with them, his life and vision with/without glasses, his beauty to others, and so on. </p><p> </p><p>Since we're talking about not only glasses, but men with glasses, we know that there's more to these attractions than simply the specs. I suppose in another (glasses-free) world, we'd still like the guys, but the specific interest within that category would necessarily lie elsewhere.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2013, 13:26</p><p>On Jo's question, I suspect in my case that if I had lived in a pre:glasses world, I would probably have been turned on by guys who were clearly nearsighted. I'm even turned on by that today ie guys who clearly need correction but don't have any. It's a lesser thrill for sure, but still a turnon.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2013, 14:43</p><p>An interesting question Jo, something I often wondered myself, especially in terms of what attracts us to this particular aspect, ie the need for visual correction, of another person, specifically for myself in other guys. I am guessing if everyone was born with, and maintained, perfect vision, then we never would have known about the need for visual correction and never developed this specific fascination, but instead it likely would have something else that distinguishes various people from one another.  For me this fascination goes back almost as long as I can remember, although only more recently have I become more accepting and open with it. Being fairly myopic myself for much of my life, I thought it was maybe related to that. However, that may not be the underlying cause, as I has lasic correction about a decade ago which I subsequently regret, not because of visual issues, but because of emotional issues. Pre-surgery, I wondered if the the fascination would go away when I was no longer myopic myself. That proved not to be the case and likely the fascination has gotten even stronger, although I now feel somewhat strange, possibly even guilty, in not being able to share in myself something that I find so fascinating in other guys. I suppose it's one of those mysteries of life that we can enjoy but never fully understand or explain. Sorry for the ramble...            </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jo</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2013, 12:25</p><p>Very random. But I was just thinking what if we were born in an era before glasses were invented? Would we become sexless ( for lack of a better word) bunch of people? I for one, has never had sex with a non glasses wearer nor can I imagine myself doing it. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2013, 23:56</p><p>Agree, he looks great in his glasses, and I think your -8 is probably pretty close given the look of the glasses.  If he were only -4, he probably wouldn't be making such a big point about his vision being so bad.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2013, 22:32</p><p>I agree, his RX looks more like -8 or so. Sometimes people (especially if not OOs like us) forget their numbers or get them confused. One thing for sure -- the glasses really enhance his looks!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2013, 21:13</p><p>Thanks te for the links.

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;13 Oct 2013, 11:02</p><p>The owner of the "Spexy and He Knows It" blog has put together a very nice You-tube video commemorating the 1st anniversary of his blog.  The video features many of the guys he featured each week for the past year.  There is a nice mix of guys in the video, the common theme being the glasses they wear, of mixed Rx's from some plusses to a mid 20's minus. Our thanks to the person (not me) behind this blog and we look forward to what he will have for us in his second year.  The first guy of the year, Juan, is certainly a myopic stunner, as mentioned in an earlier post.  Keep up the good work!

For the start of its second year, the blog owner, who features a new guy each week, is treating us to a cute double digit myopic guy who has offered up a number of close-up pictures in his high Rx glasses, as well as some open conversation about his vision and glasses. Some great material here.... including a couple of videos, one of which is about him trying to find his glasses in the morning. I am guessing many of us would welcome the chance to help him.      </p><p></p><hr>

Anyhow, this is probably the most detailed facial illustration I have ever seen, especially the way it shows the strong Rx in his myopic glasses, including the capture of the significant power rings. Often when an illustrator puts glasses on people they appear to have plano lenses,  but that is sure not the case with this illustration. It really captures the strength of his minus Rx. Sorry I couldn't figure out how to provide you a link to this.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2013, 00:30</p><p>Tivo; thanks for the posts on John; I'm not sure if you know him personally or through his videos. Either way, its interesting to see him in his old glasses (with what appear to be bi-focal lines) and then enthused, and willing to share that, about his new hi-index, transitional glasses, which are indeed thinner, despite his significant myopic Rx. In the old glasses video, despite what appear to be bifocal lines, he seems to read above his glasses, ie uncorrected, to see his phone screen, at a very close range as would expected with his Rx.     </p><p> </p><p>There's also another video of him out there where he talks about completely losing his sight for a period of time due to retinal swelling; fortunatley, per his video, that self corrected and he was back to his normal vision of significant myopia. It's admirable now easily he talks about his visual </p><p>challenges.    </p><p> </p><p>Nathan, thanks for sharing the exciting sighting that you recently had.</p><p></p><hr>

Bifocal  myodisc glasses were black plstic, thick frames, thick arms and really tinted lenses.

A small amount of BO prism will cause the appearance of cut-in, but be very hard to see.  Even 5 BO in each eye would only cause each eye to turn inward about 3 angular degrees and shift the iris inward only a tiny amount.  I don't feel like doing the trig right now, but I would guess less than 1 mm, I would SWAG about 0.5 mm for 5 BO, but don't hold me too it. Even 1 mm is too small to see looking at a straight on facial picture. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2013, 21:39</p><p>I found the cute guy in the attached post fairly intriguing.  At first glance, I thought he was wearing plus lenses the way his eyes look so big, possibly a magnified look.  But looking closer, he appears to be wearing some fairly moderate minus lenses based on the cut-in you can see in the photo. Any thoughts?  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://guyswithglasses.tumblr.com/post/61071234618" target="_blank">http://guyswithglasses.tumblr.com/post/61071234618</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2013, 06:37</p><p>thanks tinyeyes, I don't know what you mean by preferences, could you redefine that....and yes I don't mind you're rebloging what ever you wish.....not even quite sure what you mean by posts on tumbler email....I guess it's the ask me part, is that right?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2013, 05:42</p><p>yeas greg, these guys have some of the strongest glasses I have ever seen, particularly john and Antonio, they both are in the range of the high 20's.....on many occasions I have borrowed their glasses thru image manipulation to produce what I call high myopic male figures by placing their glasses on another face.....john for example is not all that good looking but has a very nice tall and erect body with a very pleasant kind of amble when he walks.....Antonio is not physically appealing to me but his glasses are almost an inch thick, one lens being a bit stronger than the other....and then Elijah with his -20 in the left eye....I will post a pic of the three of them together on my tumbler.....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2013, 22:11</p><p>Tivo, I took a look at your blog. I can re-blog some of your posts on mine if you want. But I don't think it's possible right now with your preferences. Or, let me look back at what you sent via the Tumblr email and I can post something from there, maybe. Thanks. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2013, 21:47</p><p>Thanks James for the additional posts of James Taranto; I certainly agree that the shimmer and flash of his high  power glasses in the first video is quite enticing, to put it mildly. </p><p> </p><p>While not the myope powerhouses (or should I say power-rings) of James Taranto or Scott Shane (x2), also worth a post is Ian Ayres, accomplished scholar, author,economist and lawyer.  No kidding, his resume is 24 pages long, but related to this post, also quite handsome in his mid-range myopic glasses.  Other pictures show him w/o glasses, so he must wear contacts at times.

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;03 Sep 2013, 19:36</p><p> </p><p>Thanks Tivo for the post; there actually appear to be two Scott Shanes, both pretty myopic judging from the strength of their glasses, quite noticeable in their Rx. I think the one you posted the pic of is an Economics Professor, and the other one is the NY Times journalist.  At first I wondered if they were the same guy with a couple of pretty different looks, the main similarity being their glasses. But I think they are two different guys, who happen to have the same name and both with fairly hefty minus Rx glasses; quite a coincidence.  I posted some links but they seem pretty long so may not work so it might be easier just to Google Scott Shane images and you should  get pics of both of them. Any Rx guesses on one or both?        </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>//www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/2426582816/krzr32x4195hi59r41og.jpeg&amp;imgrefurl;=https://twitter.com/ScottShaneNYT&amp;h;=300&amp;w;=300&amp;sz;=20&amp;tbnid;=awZA3BWq2X_mDM:&amp;tbnh;=90&amp;tbnw;=90&amp;zoom;=1&amp;usg;=__TJ32gDpunfwYYcLG9J-0KXBkP84=&amp;docid;=7nWygZ08iGpIoM&amp;sa;=X&amp;ei;=6n0mUoytMcuVjAL-tIGoCA&amp;ved;=0CEgQ9QEwBQ&amp;dur;=2289http: </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>//www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=<a href="http://www.thefrankpetersshow.com/images/Subjects/shane-scott.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.personalbrandingblog.com/personal-branding-interview-scott-shane/&amp;h=200&amp;w=160&amp;sz=9&amp;tbnid=J6U2FsuBuIhjuM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=72&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__rgGHq--OywI0RpaLqkYw_adJkao=&amp;docid=gv-7yDXmdY14XM&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6n0mUoytMcuVjAL-tIGoCA&amp;ved=0CFQQ9QEwCQ&amp;dur=2757" target="_blank">http://www.thefrankpetersshow.com/images/Subjects/shane-scott.jpg&amp;imgrefurl;=http://www.personalbrandingblog.com/personal-branding-interview-scott-shane/&amp;h;=200&amp;w;=160&amp;sz;=9&amp;tbnid;=J6U2FsuBuIhjuM:&amp;tbnh;=90&amp;tbnw;=72&amp;zoom;=1&amp;usg;=__rgGHq--OywI0RpaLqkYw_adJkao=&amp;docid;=gv-7yDXmdY14XM&amp;sa;=X&amp;ei;=6n0mUoytMcuVjAL-tIGoCA&amp;ved;=0CFQQ9QEwCQ&amp;dur;=2757</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;18 Aug 2013, 11:21</p><p>Visiting a store this afternoon, I had the choice of two checkout queues: One with the better-looking guy, and the other with the speccy-guy. Of course I chose the latter, and his glasses didn't disappoint. I could see from afar that his prescription was strong, and it was clearly in double digits. </p><p> </p><p>His frames were small (perhaps 45 mm lens width) but the lenses projected far behind the rims, as well as in front. I'd say 12 mm thick and safely into double figures. A fairly standard frame, but with nice moderately wide plastic temples adding a bit of style. He was young, so I guess his myopia started in childhood and progressed through adolescence towards its current dizzy heights. </p><p> </p><p>I noticed that this guy read my payment card and receipt closely, so I guess he piles on the eyestrain whenever he reads anything else too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2013, 09:51</p><p>GreginColo, </p><p>You are correct.  Pinholes or even glasses or contacts, for that matter, only provide correction for most people as long as you wear them.  With one exception, they do nothing to "improve" vision, long term.  That exception is latent hyperopia.  In latent hyperopia, the ciliary muscles and crystalline lenses are under constant stress to provide the extra plus needed to focus at distance, internally, and over time, they can take a "set".  That situation uses up some of their "Accommodation Amplitude" or range which often leads to early onset of the symptoms of presbyopia. </p><p>However, don't assume that latent hyperopia's reduction of Accommodation Amplitude is the only factor in the onset of presbyopia.  There are more factors involved, which makes the relationship between hyperopia and presbyopia hard to understand, made all the more challenging because they apparently have the same solution, external plus lenses or in the case of people with myopia, a reduction in the minus for distance. </p><p>There are a lot of myths associated with vision that can be easily explained if you have an understanding of optics and the physiology of the eyes. It is sad when people propagate myths that simply are not true to people who don't have enough knowledge to separate myth and conjecture from proven facts.  Some of the "laws" of optics may not be exactly right, but they are close enough that they have worked pretty well for over 300 years.  Recent discoveries in Quantum Mechanics have shown that Sir Isaac Newton was not exactly right with some of his laws of motion and gravity, but they are close enough that the space vehicles that use them, mostly get where we want them to go or stay in orbit long enough to be very useful. </p><p>My philosophy is similar to that of the Christophers.  'It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness". </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;16 Aug 2013, 23:38</p><p>Thanks Cactus Jack for the very thorough explanation of the science behind vision improvement, as in recent video post, with the use of pinhole glasses.  Based on your explanation it seems the improvement would last only while the pinhole glasses are being worn, correct?  Thanks for the wisdom and insights, and time you take to put them into posts, that you share with the Eyescene audience. Regards, Greg.      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;16 Aug 2013, 10:21</p><p>Pinhole glasses </p><p>There is nothing new or strange going on with the optical effects of single pinholes or multiple pinholes as in the pinhole glasses.  Pinhole effects are used to advantage everyday by photographers and by Eye Care Professionals (ECPs) to help determine if optical correction (adjustment of the location of the plane of focus by using lenses) of vision defects are even possible.   </p><p>The optical term for a hole through which a bundle of light rays pass is called the aperture.  In photography, the size of the aperture in relation to the focal length of the lens is called the f-stop.  The term f-stop is not used for vision purposes, but just for information, the typical f-stop range of the eye is about f 8 (pupil diameter of 2 mm) in bright light to f 2 (pupil diameter of 8 mm) in dim light, but it can vary some, depending on the optics of a myopic or hyperopic eyeball and the optical power of an individual cornea. </p><p>The primary effect of aperture size is to control the amount of light admitted to the eye or the camera to strike the retina, the film, or the image sensor in a digital camera.  An important secondary effect of aperture size in photography is Depth of Field or range of useful focus.  The smaller the aperture size (higher f-stop) the greater the depth of field.  In vision, the smaller pupil opening in bright light, the wider the range of useful focus.  That is why eye exam rooms are NOT brightly lit so the pupil opening will be as wide as practically possible and the depth of field will be as narrow as possible to determine the patients actual prescription as accurately as possible.  Of course, many ECPs have a trick up their sleeve when they want the pupil really WIDE open - dilation. Dilation has the useful side effect of paralyzing the ciliary muscles so they cant mess with the (hopefully) relaxed state of the crystalline lens. </p><p>ECPs typically use a pinhole lens with one small (1 to 2 mm) hole, which is typically good for seeing an eye chart.  The multi-hole glasses in the video just allow you to look around to see a broader field.  The big disadvantage of the pinhole glasses is the substantial reduction in light admittance, but an important secondary disadvantage is that they dont offer the degree of correction provided by optical lenses.  True, the holes could be made smaller, but then another effect of hole size comes into play, edge diffraction where light rays tend to bend around the edges of the hole as the hole size becomes closer to the wavelength of the light.  BTW, you can see similar effects in wave action in a calm body of water as waves encounter objects and bend around them. </p><p>I hope this helps. If you want to know more about how this stuff works, there are some pretty good explanations about Aperture effects in lenses and depth of field in Wikipedia and other on-line sites. </p><p>C.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;16 Aug 2013, 00:06</p><p>That is quite an interesting post/video about the pinhole glasses.  Besides getting to watch a significantly myopic guy talk about and test his vision, with and without his glasses, the improvement in his myopia appears to be quite immediate and dramatic while using the non-Rx pinhole glasses.  I don't know what would cause such an immediate improvement but maybe someone smarter on the subject than myself, such as Cactus Jack, might be able to weigh in on this.  The myopic reviewer seems very sincere in his testing and evaluation of the glasses.  I would also be curious if this result is only for myopia or whether it might also work for hyperopia.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2013, 06:45</p><p>good morning, thank you greg, for the story, I am setting up a tumbler account, actually I have had one for years and still don't know how to navigate it all that well....time will teach and hopefully I will be able to bring my entire collection public.....i'm hoping to break it up into three sections, one the real myopic, thick glasses wearing people I have known, two some of the ones outside my circle of acquaintance and three the morphes that I have created from all two groups.....yesterday john, my friend from tampa with the ultra thick glasses  loaned me a pair that I had given him some time ago, to give to bori for modeling, bori is minus 3 something and doesn't mind modeling glasses for me.......it was interesting to me that john would not part with his original glasses even though he had two pairs, but rather he offered me two pairs, both slightly tinted and some extra frames all that I had given him over the years that we have known one another, again a very mysterious movement on john's part, only saying 'I would rather not say why right now' </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2013, 23:37</p><p>I was picking up a few things in my neighborhood supermarket over the weekend and was about ready to head to the checkouts when I noticed a mid-40ish (or so I am guessing) guy in sunglasses which appeared to have some myopic flash to them so decided to stay and shop a bit longer, and get a closer look. They were black plastic frames with a pretty strong grayish/green tint.  With the tint it was hard to judge the cut-in, but they appeared to be flat-fronts with some noticeable edge thickness.  Seeing that I was expecting, and hoping, he would soon change to his regular glasses, but he was wearing some pretty light running or biking clothes, so it wasn't obvious as to where he might have his glasses stored, other than possibly in a small waist pack we was wearing. I am guessing his Rx was around -10. </p><p> </p><p>As he began to walk around the store, I suspected he may not have been familiar with the layout of the store.  He spotted one of the store directories hanging from the ceiling but appeared to have trouble reading it with the strong tint in has glasses, so he just kind of wandered around the store picking up a few things. A couple of times he pulled his sunglasses off to read labels, noticeably  close to his face.   </p><p> </p><p>As he proceeded to the checkouts, I got in the line behind him as the checker was about halfway though a larger order in front of him. Getting up a bit of nerve, I said "You must have left you regular glasses in the car".  "How'd you know?" he asked curiously.  Instead of being truthful and saying it was kind of a hobby/fascination of mine to notice guys in glasses, I said something to the effect of "Yep, I've done that before myself" (before Lasik). He said he was actually out for a bike ride and forgot to bring his regular glasses and it was a real pain to navigate the store in sunglasses, but would have been impossible without them."  </p><p> </p><p>I wanted to ask his Rx, but the checker had finished the prior order so he proceeded to check out and wished me a nice day and I said likewise and thanked him for the chat.  I was glad I was wearing some heavier weight, and looser,  cargo shorts rather the lighter and tighter biking shorts he had on.  Our conversation was brief, but he seemed like  a nice guy so I regretted not starting conversation sooner and offering to help him find what he was looking for in the store.           </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2013, 07:48</p><p>A couple of things that may be of interest to you in case you haven't seen: </p><p> </p><p>1) On the "Guys w/Glasses" blog there is a "Behind the Scenes" interview with a young Randy Blue model named Antonio Galvon. He is moderately myopic and talks a little about wearing glasses during the interview.  It would be quite fun and exciting to see a scene with him and Dean Skye, another myopic Randy Blue model, glasses on, glasses off, trading/sharing glasses.... </p><p> </p><p>2) On the "Spexy and He Knows It" blog, there is really fun content this week featuring a young highly myopic comedian/performer named Dave Labedz. In addition to some great photos at various times in his life, he is very open to discussing his myopia and some of the impacts it has had on him, and some of the situations he has been in with, and without, his glasses.  Definitely worth a look.   </p><p> </p><p>And again, a big thanks to the guys who take the time and interest to host the various guys and glasses type of sites and blogs. I don't have that those computer talents, so express things more in words.    </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2013, 23:29</p><p>Thanks David; I am glad I was able to help him out but must also admit I was particularly interested in helping because of his specific need, ie his being moderately myopic and needing correction to basically function.  Had his post been for some other type of need, ie lost his sleeping bag or his bike or his shoes, I probably wouldn't have responded, especially since he was 45 minutes away, figuring someone else could probably help him quicker and easier.  But in this case I was kind of on a mission to meet him and help him, even though it took us five days to actually meet up. Had my old glasses not worked for him, I probably would have taken him to a chain store optical shop, where you can get an exam and single vision glasses for $99 and paid for them for him.  Of course, it would have been fun for me to learn his true Rx and watch him try on frames.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2013, 21:39</p><p>Greg, </p><p> </p><p>That is very admirable of you. You made this guy's time. </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2013, 23:22</p><p>A brief followup to my post 5 days or so ago about a homeless guy who lost his glasses and was posting on C/L for some help.  I had contacted him back soon after I saw the post, asking about his Rx in case I could help him with some of pre-lasik :( minus glasses that I had hung on to. He confirmed he was nearsighted but didn't know his Rx, but knew things were quite blurry without his glasses. After a w/e of emailing back and forth and trying to connect, since I was about 45 minutes away from him and for me, a w/e with very limited free time.  Today, he caught a bus for the 45 miles to get to my town. He had gotten a number of replies to his C/L post but none that had yet solved his problem. </p><p>  </p><p>We met up in a public place and introduced ourselves. He had very attractive brown eyes but I could tell he was having trouble seeing out of them.  He was homeless by choice, actually a very nice, educated upper 30's man who had taken the summer off and was traveling from NY to Calif, doing day labor along the way to cover expenses. He had stopped in Boulder CO to do some whitewater rafting and that's when he lost his glasses. His limited vision then limited his ability to do any more day labor until he could get some glasses, so he just hung out in parks, etc until he could get up to FC. He said he had a bike but crashed into a curb that he couldn't see and pretty much ruined the bike.   </p><p> </p><p>When we got to my vehicle I gave him the weakest pair that I had (probably -5 to -6) and he tried them on and said they worked great for him. He could immediately read the house numbers on the house across the street whereas before he said he could barely tell that the house was even there. </p><p>He also tried on a couple of stronger pairs (-6 to -7) but felt those were too strong.  He said the weaker pair seemed very much like his own glasses and felt good.  They also looked good on him as he has a thinner face like myself. Those were also from my pre-progessive add days, which he didn't need. I also gave him a pair on similar Rx sunglasses. I offered to buy him dinner but he said he just wanted to walk around and experience being able to see clearly again and see that trees actually had leaves rather than just being big blobs to steer clear of. He was very thankful and I was equally thankful to be a able to help him as I remember how tough it was to be without glasses for even a small period of time, let alone going on a week and in strange surroundings.  I would have loved to have spent some of that time with him, but that didn't work out and I certainly wouldn't wanted to have prolonged his visual misery any longer.  But he had great spirits and was looking forward to continuing his journey after hoping to get in a few days or so of day labor locally, now that is back to normal, or near normal vision.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

They were very good musically and all very attractive guys, but especially the singer in his his half frame, medium strength myopic glasses. He was quite active in his singing and all over the stage, but his glasses stayed up well. The judges really liked the act so they were advanced to the next round so hopefully we'll see more of him/them, and he will continue to appear in glasses.  He could be the next Danny Gokey, I think that has his name, a myopic American Idol contestant, usually performing in his glasses, of several years back.          </p><p></p><hr>

One or more of these may be the view(s) that tinyeyes was referring to with the Buddy Holly style glasses.  None of the photos are real clear but the one in the straw hat would indicate an Rx requiring full time use until hitting it big and getting contacts, except for the rare photo that Grant posted.

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2013, 21:11</p><p>Thanks Grant for the great Carpenters' photo; I too am a big Carpenters' fan and have been for 40+ years. The current bio on Richard says that he is 67 y/o, has five kids (first born when he was 40), still writes and produces music, lives in Thousand Oaks CA, and "wears contacts", so maybe never did have surgery. If I recall both he and Karen were also fans and owners of vintage Mopar (Chrysler Corp) cars of the late 50's, with a '59 DeSoto convertible once owned by Richard recently selling for big bucks (can't remember the exact amount).  Thanks again for the post, especially with Richard in his hefty myopic lenses.        </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2013, 17:29</p><p>Wow, I'm a Carpenters fan and wasn't really aware of this!  </p><p>I do remember one early photo I saw from before they hit it big, from the mid-60s, where he had short hair and Buddy Holly-ish black frame glasses, but the RX was not evident.

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2013, 17:24</p><p> </p><p>Yes, he is kind of cute in a geeky sort of way.  Nevertheless, if I were in his visual and career position, I'd go for a frame that was slightly wider (like the woman who is a -23) and just deal with the extra thickness. (I expect that he is also using a super high index glass lens.)  His specs really are a bit too small for his big face and actually draw a bit more attention to themselves and his obviously strong prescription because of their puny scale. </p><p> </p><p>Most people don't have a clue about eyeglass strength unless the lenses are super thick.   </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for the link to this site!

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2013, 14:40</p><p>One more thought; his glasses are very small in relation to his face, almost like the mini reading glasses you see, no doubt to help diminish the look of the strong Rx.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2013, 14:15</p><p>I agree with you about the attraction of a spexy policeman.

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2013, 12:47</p><p>I do like a policeman with specs.

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2013, 17:09</p><p>Well the media have been digging for info about a younger Ed Snowden and appear to have turned up some pics and other info. </p><p> </p><p>The pics are most interesting for us on Eyescene, with this one (<a href="http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/51b8de5ceab8ea8368000020-1024-768/bmljswocaaaqvax%20(1).gif)" target="_blank">http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/51b8de5ceab8ea8368000020-1024-768/bmljswocaaaqvax%20(1).gif)</a> showing a nice bit of lens thickness (but high-index, I would've thought) and others showing him either in contacts or bare-eyed. </p><p> </p><p>For all we know, he might only just have broken his current specs, or not really care. But he might well have considered the image he wants to present to the world. He's gained a lot of attention after all, and not just from our group of enthusiasts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2013, 18:59</p><p>The news info revealed that Ed Snowden was a high school dropout so maybe why no earlier pictures have surfaced, as the media can usually dig up a high school yearbook picture or two. Despite his lack of formal education he is quite articulate.  I agree with JP that he is wearing his glasses because he needs them to see; his vision would be quite poor without them. And he seems quite comfortable wearing them not adjusting them during the interview as someone who didn't regularly wear glasses might do. I don;t think he is trying to disguise his appearance or he probably would have done a lot more or just spoken from being a screen or something.  He may have had to leave his normal residence quite quickly so that pair of glasses may be the only vision correction he has available at the moment, and would be in a very blurry world without them.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2013, 17:25</p><p>No more of the script finder nonsense. Would this man, of aanyon, have such personal data available? No.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2013, 17:22</p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Scriptor</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2013, 17:00</p><p>Edward Snowden's prescription is: </p><p>OD -7.50 -1.00 x.065 </p><p>OS -8.00 -1.25 x 180 </p><p> </p><p>Per Scripfinder</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2013, 16:35</p><p>I love that Edward Snowden is wearing those specs, to be honest. Uncomfortable as they might be, he needs them to see, more than he needs to take them off to avoid being seen with broken specs. And yeah, I like that for a moment there just a few of us in the world appreciated him and glasses enough to notice that missing part. </p><p> </p><p>I'd love to try on those specs.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2013, 10:43</p><p>GreginColo may be correct that Snowden wears contacts. Could be the interview in glasses was just a way to alter his appearance. The broken frames also begs the question: Why would someone who claims to have been making 200K USD walk around in busted spex? Unfortunately all the pictures of him online seem to be from the interview. Hope someone comes up with earlier pictures. </p><p> </p><p>One more thought. When he was in the army he supposedly applied to be in the "special forces". Was wondering if anyone knew whether someone with an Rx as strong as his would be accepted. It appears he left the army after he broke both his legs. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2013, 14:16</p><p> </p><p>I'd say they're -8/-9.  A great prescription!  On top of that he is quite geek cute.  Much cuter (and much smarter) than that dweeb Bradley Manning who's probably -3/-4.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2013, 13:28</p><p>Good catch JP noting the missing nose piece; his glasses seem to stay in place well during the interview, but it might be a bit uncomfortable.  Wonder if he normally wears contacts, and hence hasn't updated his glasses although he does appear very comfortable in them.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2013, 13:22</p><p>Yes he does seem to be showing up a lot now that he has identified himself; certainly a very brave young man. It took me 6 months just to get up the nerve to post something on here. I am guessing the Rx is likely in the -6 to -10 range as had already been speculated, and probably the upper end of that range.

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2013, 17:23</p><p> </p><p>Greg - Yes, I love it when a guy (particularly minus) switches to glasses. And loathe it when a guy switches out of glasses or - worse - an actor switches into planos, as though it makes no different. Artie did this once in Glee. </p><p> </p><p>Adam B - I just signed in to share that same link. The guy's cute, and it's especially good when he looks through those minus lenses close-up at his work. I like the thought that focussing close-up overcomes the minus, yet ultimately the lenses overcome natural vision and foster the need for greater minus.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gregin Colo</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2013, 22:56</p><p>Thanks JP for sharing your retail clerk sighting &amp; chat also.  As likely for most of us viewing or contributing to the thread, a guy in glasses always adds some added excitement/attraction for me, but it is especially uplifting when he is also willing to converse about his glasses and/or vision.  I am getting a little more brave about initiating such conversations. While I am mainly a moderate to high minus fan, the right plus scenario can be quite interesting also, as you mentioned.   </p><p> </p><p>Switching gears, or maybe better lenses, a bit, there's a show here in the US called Househunters that I enjoy watching, because I enjoy housing and architecture.  The show follows a person or couple (sometimes same sex) as they look at a number of houses over a period of days or weeks and then select one to try and purchase.  It's especially hot if there's a guy who suddenly appears in a scene or scenes wearing glasses, and usually strong enough to know he was not bare-eyed in the non-glasses scenes.  I think its great that people are comfortable enough to make that switch back and forth, even knowing it will be on national tv.  Regards, Greg.        </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2013, 03:27</p><p>Yep, GreginColo, it's a winner when someone's willing to talk about their specs. I complimented a supermarket checkout guy on his (small wire-rimmed strong plus - which worked on him) frames once, and had a nice little chat. Definitely lifts my mood! </p><p> </p><p>We've had some good posts here lately - Cheyenne Jackson's a favourite.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;26 May 2013, 21:32</p><p>Yes JP, he was pretty hot, to me because of his reasonably strong glasses and willingness to talk about them, in addition to his general friendliness.  I left the store in a different state than I arrived in.  But talking about hot, the hottest I have seen in a long time is Chad Stark.  See posts below  and also on GWTG site.  Thanks again Grant, and also TE, for those quite stimulating posts.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;26 May 2013, 01:19</p><p>Thanks for Chad Stark, Grant. What a hottie!  </p><p>A good looking guy with a real prescription, around -10 for sure. Nice!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopic Grant</b>&nbsp;25 May 2013, 01:20</p><p>My Pleasure Greg!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;24 May 2013, 22:56</p><p>I was in a retail store last night just before closing, and heard the announcement that the store would be closing in 5 minutes. The guy making the announcement seemed to have a very friendly manner as he was encouraging shoppers to head toward the checkouts, which I did.  The checkouts were right next to the service desk so I noticed the guy as he made another announcement over the PA.  He was around 30 I would guess, but was wearing some pretty strong minus glasses, I am guessing -8 to -10 range, in some attractive gray plastic frames.  Seeing that, I moved toward the service desk, trying to think of a question to ask him to be able to engage in a bit of conversation.    Before I could do that he asked if I would like to be checked out there at the service desk and I said sure. </p><p> </p><p>There was no one else in line at the service desk, so while he was ringing up my items, I told him I thought his glasses had a great look on him.  He said he liked them also, but they were already a year old and he felt he was getting more blind again so would probably have to go in for a check-up and get new glasses again. I asked him what his prescription was and he said he couldn't remember the numbers but knew it was pretty stong and likely to get stronger. He said the distance was getting to be a bit blurry just like it was before he got his current glasses.  I didn't say it to him, but found myself thinking that his Rx probably should have stablized by his age. I thanked him for checking me out, wished him a good evening, and good wishes in getting his eyes checked and new glasses if needed. In addition to the thanks for shopping at (store name), he thanked me for the conversation and compliment about his glasses.   This was a store that I don't frequent that often but its nearby so will probably do so more frequenly on the off-chance of catching him again, especially since he seemed quite open to talking about his glasses and his vision.          </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 May 2013, 12:10</p><p>Back in the days when the original EyeScene was new - 16 years ago! - and Wurm was still called Chris, Mark, one of the very early posters who still posts once in a blue moon under the name of Mark One, launched a site called 'Guys who wear glasses' - it was in the West Hollywood section of Geocities, for those who remember such things. I think Mark would agree with me that 'spexy guys are sexy guys'; anyway I used to wait eagerly for the monthly update. He took the site down years ago, long before Geocities went out of existence, but not before I had downloaded all the photos which I still have in a folder on my hard disc. This morning I decided to use it as a screen saver instead of one of the more recent and better quality folders I normally use, of cute and mostly spexy guys, and I was struck by the style of frames that were popular in the mid-90s. I took the trouble to go through the folder of 129 photos, some of which have more than one guy in them, and I reckon there were 117 pairs of wire rims, 87 of them round. How different from what we see on Tumblr blogs today!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2013, 15:02</p><p>Thanks Julian and Cactus Jack for the updates on Bobby's site and related sources of stimulating guys with glasses stories.  In fact a few of my own stories (pen name myopmanfan) are there, but certainly not as good as some of the original stories on Bobby's site.  Thanks again, Greg. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2013, 13:48</p><p>GreginColo: I've just discovered that some of the 'Men in glasses' stories that were on Bobby's site (and, let's hope, will be again) are on the Yahoo 'gay glasses fetish fiction' group. A lot of the stories were there originally there - unfortunately a lot of them were uploaded as links and were lost when Geocities closed down, but a few of them have ben reposted, along with some which are (to put it mildly) very explicit.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 Apr 2013, 02:37</p><p>Greg, Cactus: On Bobby's newer site, <a href="http://bobbylaurel.blogspot.cz/" target="_blank">http://bobbylaurel.blogspot.cz/</a> he writes about the problems on his original site and says he hopes to get them put right by the weekend - that was last weekend, so I guess he still hasn't succeeded::( I'm with you Greg, I really miss the older site, but Bobby assures us the stories are all safe. If all else fails I guess he'll move them to the newer site, but that will take time in all conscience!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2013, 23:06</p><p>GreginColo, </p><p>I am not certain, but it is possible that Bobby is working on it or a new site.  He mentioned something about that a few months ago and perhaps he just got around to it.  Here is a translation of the text by an online translation program: </p><p>"Access is denied. Author Web site probably does not have the file in the main folder uploaded index.html or index.php, which is required for the operation site."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jo</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2013, 13:00</p><p>Hi tinyeyes </p><p> </p><p> 145 is a 20 year old with a -20 prescription. I believe he is straight.  </p><p>256 is also about 20. He is gay and is very into thick glasses as well. He has several pairs with prescription ranging from -21 to -30. He initially claims to be -30 but later said he's -22. I suspect goc but I'm not sure.  </p><p>362 is someone whom I've not chatted before but based on the info he provided from where I downloaded his pics, he's a -15. I suspect an OO looking at the oversized frames. </p><p></p><hr>

If you have time, it would be great if you could add more details about the guys (gay or not, RX, if they wear contacts, how you found them, etc.) These super-strong prescriptions are hard to believe, but there they are! It's hard to imagine that many people would be doing glasses over contacts. For example, I would love to hear more about the guys in pictures 145, 256, and 362.</p><p></p><hr>

BTW, for the guy in the pic, he is married but gay. i too am very aroused by his glasses and am even considering flying over to meet him up. its a 2 hours flight from where i am, but due to work commitments, i'm unable to do it anytime soon. will keep you posted if i do.</p><p></p><hr>

Could you elaborate a little bit about how you got the scar tissue? If you'd like, we might want to consider moving this conversation to a more appropriate thread. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ellie</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2013, 15:39</p><p>I'm guessing that retinal health and astigmatism likely play roles in affecting visual acuity as well. However, I'm no expert, so I could be wrong.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2013, 20:11</p><p>Thanks Bwian for the two videos; both interesting guys. The second (skateboard guy)appears to me to be noticeably more more myopic than the first.

I have never worn contacts, always glasses, but your thoughts make good sense after having watched people at times struggle to remove their contacts.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2013, 17:21</p><p>tinyeyes, </p><p>I suspect, but don't know for sure, that the reason people who have had retinal detachment are concerned about wearing contact lenses is not the lenses themselves, but the stresses and pressures that are sometimes necessary to remove the lenses.  Insertion of the lenses is usually pretty gentle, but often it is necessary to apply pressure or distort the eyeball a bit to break the suction between the lens and the cornea.  Anything that could put stress on the retinal re-attachement bonds is probably avoided at all costs. </p><p>I have never had any hint of a retinal detachment, but from reading the experiences of others and a description by a relative who had it happen, it can REALLY get your attention and you have no desire to repeat the experience. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2013, 04:43</p><p>Tinyeyes - that's interesting that you say that, as I've met people with formerly detached retinas who were told contact lens wear will always up the risk, even if only slightly, of the retina detaching again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2013, 14:06</p><p>Yes, thanks for the info James. I didn't realize he was as high as -16.  </p><p>I don't know if detached retinas necessarily preclude contact lens wear, although they may make lasik or ICL surgery impossible.

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2013, 08:26</p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>He has a really crazy prescription, read somewhere in the range of -16 in his right (worse) eye. This came out when the German media was mocking his nearsightedness and choice of eyewear during his last campaign a few years ago. He also had detached retinas in both eyes at age 19, so no ICL's or contacts in his future! </p><p> </p><p>Amazing how a major league Rx can make a not very conventionally attractive man really intriguing to me. With that kind of eyesight, though, I imagine the world is a really different place for him, perception-wise, than it is for those with 20/20 vision or even mild to moderate myopia. While I'm sure he can technically "see", I'd imagine it's a very tiny and one dimensional world with little depth perception, like he can see what's right ahead of him and not much more.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kevin</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2013, 04:51</p><p>Had a great sighting at my gym yesterday. After my workout I went to the sauna for a quick rest. Was in there for about 2 minutes on my own until the door opened a man's voice said 'ah shouldn't have worn my glasses'. Curiousty got the better of me and I put my glasses on to see 2 men in their 40s both in glasses. They both proceeded to take off their glasses as the warm air steamed them up. I plucked up the courage to say 'it's not a good place if you need glasses', one just smiled while the other said 'ye but I'm blind as a bat, I wouldn't find my way from the dressing room to here without them'. I replied 'tell me about it' and the conversation ended. They both put their glasses back on before they left.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2013, 04:13</p><p>Its Me    let me explain, i think i posted earlier on that victor was not coopertive and would not pose with his new glasses, he hasn't for some time now...these fotos were taken about two years ago and the one was morphed from the other and still others to give the groupe an idea what his new glasses are like.....victor has changed glasses and prescriptions so many times since i met him about two years ago, that i do believe he may be a well closeted g.o.c.er, but who knows, what i do know is that he started off with glasses somewhere around -17 and now is doing well over minus 20 with myodiscs that are are extremely well defined with pronounced prisms...along with all of this mystery victor has sported on different occasions glasses ranging from - 7 or 8 to maybe 10; then stronger ones, then tinted ones, then i saw him recieving  handout glasses from a mission in down town tampa, that were for reading, also he has  appeared in glasses of a lighter script again that were completely different in strenght from one eye to the other....he is seemingly homeless, posibly mentally ill, definitely super tense and hyper anxious and somewhat paranoid.....rides a bicycle all the time...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2013, 22:14</p><p>tinyeyes, </p><p>If I can offer some comments regarding Herbies choice of the plus contacts.  If you consider the following back of an envelope calculations to balance his glasses prescriptions: </p><p>His current glasses prescription is: </p><p>R -20.25 sphere </p><p>L -9.50 sphere </p><p>If we allow for a 12 mm vertex distance and calculate his eye power (the inverse of his prescription at the cornea) we get the following. </p><p>R +15.42  (CL = -15.50) </p><p>L  +8.41  (CL= -8.50) </p><p>The first question is what power contact lens should Herbie wear to make his Right Eye require to match the glasses prescription in his Left eye? </p><p>We know his Right eye power so to make his Left Eye require approximately a -20.25 glasses lens, we need a +7.00 CL </p><p>The second question is what power contact lens should Herbie wear to make his Left Eye match the glasses prescription in his Right Eye </p><p>Again we know the eye powers and we would need a -7.00 CL to partially correct his Right eye to require a -9.50 glasses lens. </p><p>Now consider the shapes of the lenses. </p><p>For maximum comfort, the outer edge of the lens needs to be very thin and the thickness increase as you approach the center of the lens, very nearly the natural shape of the cornea itself, just a little thicker in the center. </p><p>Now consider the shape of a relatively high minus CL.  It needs to be very thin at the edges for the most comfort the increase rapidly in thickness about 1/3 the distance from the edge to the center and then get thin again near the center of the lens to produce the -7.00 power. </p><p>The relative comfort of the different lens shapes depends on the tightness and relative sensitivity of the eyelid as it moves across the lens.  I suspect, but dont know for sure that the -7.00 lens has a noticeable circular ridge that the +7.00 lens does not. </p><p>Unlike the person who needs a -15.50 CL for both eye, Herbie can easily compare the relative comfort of each power lens on his corneas and make a choice of which one he prefers. </p><p>I hope this makes sense. </p><p>Herbie, I would appreciate your comments on my explanation and my estimation of the CL powers.  I used the commonly accepted formulas for the calculations, but I dont think the calculations are exactly right at very high prescriptions.  The best way do determine the glasses prescription is a refraction with the CL in place.  The result for your left eye may not be exactly 20.25 with the contact, but glasses are commonly available in 0.25 increments and contacts around these powers go from 0.25 to 0.50 increments.  The examiner can be more accurate with the glasses prescriptions. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Its Me</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2013, 20:19</p><p>I think its amazing that Victor is wearing the same clothes in both photos and the photos are taken in the same location!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2013, 19:56</p><p>I switch between contacts usually during the day and glasses at night. Not sure how to post a photo. </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2013, 02:14</p><p>Herbie, it's interesting hearing about your solution to your vision correction.  </p><p>Do you wear hard or soft lenses? I'm curious as to why the minus contact lens is uncomfortable. Is it because of the thickness?  I don't know if I've heard of a contact lens, either hard or soft, available as high a power as -20. What is the limit of power of a contact lens, does anyone know?  </p><p> </p><p>On a related subject, I talked to a guy who is blind in one eye and about -8 in the other. He wears one contact much of the time, but when wearing glasses, for appearance's sake he wears the -8 prescription in both eyeglass lenses. It looks much better. And course fas an OO who likes the look of a strong prescription, I would agree.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>herbie</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2013, 12:53</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p> </p><p>Yes your comments are perfectly true. When I wear glasses without any contacts I get double vision.   </p><p>The plus contact lens I wear on my left eye is much more comfortable than the minus contact lens required on the right. It means I wear -20.25 glasses which are strong but give me good vision. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2013, 11:42</p><p>this morning i got the surprised of a lifetime from my old contact victor who some of you may know thru a throughly ficticious story, but anyway victor has been an enigma all along, starting with a total lack of cooperation in regards to fotographing, along with unpredictable mood swings....i have dubbed him a a closet goc' er mostly becuase he has  appeared in so many different glasses at different times and now from a seemingly very low script, after sporting a high one to start with, to a very high one, i would say some where in the high twenties, he has even dawned plus reading glases, but all in in all he's totally illusivw and unwilling to stand in front of a camera at this time, so i assulated what he looked like this morning and compared it to the forst time that i was able to capture some fotos of him which appear in the same web albums just click on to tivo's albums on the bar above 'victor today and before'....here's the picasa web album link...... </p><p> https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/tEBvH8DRJEZXlFZ5r7fgRcbGJJehgshrU-Zogq7Z6qk?feat=directlink</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2013, 10:20</p><p>One of the big problems people with very mismatched prescriptions is the difference in image sizes on the retna caused primarily by Vertex Distance effects. Sometimes it can make it nearly impossible to fuse the images and keep them fused. Contact Lenses with Zero Vertex Distance do not change image size very much, so the idea of using a contact lens on one eye to match up the glasses prescription is a good one and then, correct the final result with glasses.  The choice of which eye to wear the contact should be the choice of the patient after trying both. </p><p>I remember a few years ago that an ES poster had a similar problem where the different size images made it difficult for him to read without double vision problems.  The several ECPs he had seen had tried everything but a single contact lens to match up the image sizes. I suggested that he look into that option and never heard back. </p><p>A good solution to a not very rare problem, Herbie. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2013, 09:36</p><p>Thanks Herbie; for you response, I am glad that single eye GOC works well for you, as a way of providing comfortable and clear vision for you.  I assume you are not yet of the age, as are some of us, that requires near vision correction also, which adds another complexity.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>herbie</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2013, 08:54</p><p>Thanks for the replies guys.The photos were great. </p><p> </p><p>I have always had mismatched rxs but in my teens and early 20s the difference got bigger. I get better vision if I use one contact lens to equal out the eyes then finally correct with glasses. The most comfortable is to use a plus contact lens to make both eyes high minus then use strong minus glasses,vision is better too. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2013, 22:03</p><p>A number of thoughts/questions here: </p><p> </p><p>Re Jack Lew: I agree with tinyeyes, who is a great judge of myopic Rx's, that Lew's Rx is likely pretty strong, ie in the teens;  there are a few recent pictures of him that show significant cut-in when he tilts his head a bit to one side or the other.  At his age he must have some progressive near distance correction built in or else be switching glasses a lot for the all numbers and charts he must be frequently looking at. It would be interesting to see some younger day pics of him but I couldn't find any.  </p><p> </p><p>Re Herbie: The difference in your Rx's is quite intruiging; that is a large difference. I would be interested in knowing your visual history, as to whether you always had a proportional difference, or whether one eye changed much more rapidly than the other. If you don't want to share this on ES but would do so via email let me know and I will provide that to you. </p><p> </p><p>And lastly a gym sighting today. An attractive mid-40ish guy who I had never seen in glasses before showed up today in some some upper single digit glasses in attractive brushed aluminum rectangular frames.  He was working with a trainer so I couldn't strike up a conversation, but it had me wishing I didn't have to get to work and could linger through the end of his workout.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2013, 09:11</p><p>Jack Lew actually looks to be at least -10, maybe even as high as -12. His well-chosen small frames minimize thickness and do a good job of hiding cut-in, but make no mistake, they're very powerful. In photos where you can see part of his eyes or eyelids not covered by the eyeglasses, you can see the major difference in size, which helps show how strong the correction is. He's 57 years old, so I'm assuming he's in bifocals, but I would think it would be difficult to make bifocals with such small frames -- interesting. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2013, 21:29</p><p>Church is probably not the most appropriate place for myoguy sightings, but it happens, so I will share one here and hopefully not offend anyone. And to be totally honest, a myoguy sighting is hard for me to ignore regardless of the setting.  The church I attend is a somewhat specialized, small congregation, so we typically average about 25 at our weekly service, so it is easy to notice a guest in our midst, and we always try to be very welcoming to them.   </p><p> </p><p>This past Sunday, an attractive guy showed up, my initial guess 50 y/o, +or- 5 either way, and we sat in the same pew.  I quickly noticed he was wearing mid-range myopic glasses, I am guessing -5 to -8 range, in attractive frames. He must not have had any near vision correction however as to read anything he would slightly lower his glasses and look above them, with the material at a pretty close range, something I used to do myself, and probably more convenient than needing to have the right power of reading glasses available, as I do now.      </p><p> </p><p>Anyhow, after the actual service we have a fellowship time so I had a chance to chat with him a bit more and learned his age to be 55, so I was surprised he add not yet availed himself of some near vision correction.  He seemed like a very nice guy and I hope he will return sometime in the future, and if so I'll be interested to see if he is in glasses or contacts. I am left wondering if he normally wears contacts so has not bothered to update his glasses for some near vision assistance.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2013, 10:16</p><p>The chain supermarket where I normally shop opened a store relatively close to my house about 5 years ago. There was a male cashier there, tall, slender, handsome, probably early 30's, dark eyes, and dark hair pulled tight to his head and braided in the back. By the way he blinked his eyes a lot I suspected he was wearing some fairly powerful contacts but wasn't sure. I would usually try to go through his checkout line if he was available as he was always quite friendly, in addition to his overall handsomeness.  </p><p> </p><p>Several years back, the chain opened another store, that he transferred to, on the opposite side of town so I didn't see him much after that, until yesterday (New Year's Eve day)when I was in that part of town so decided to shop there, pretty much having forgotten about the fact that he worked there. As I approached the checkout lines I noticed he was working, so I made sure to go his line, especially when I noticed he was wearing glasses with pretty strong appearing myopic lenses.   </p><p> </p><p>I had a fairly large order so it gave us some time for small talk as to how he liked this store vs the prior one. I finally got up the nerve to compliment him on his glasses, flat-fronted, reflective, lenses in stylish wrap-around lenses with wide temples making it difficult to judge the lense thickness, but I am guessing at least a -10. He continued to say that the smoke from area forest fires we had this past summer had begun to bother his contacts enough that he would have to switch out of them midway thru this shift so finally just started wearing glasses full time for work.  I again complimented him on his look with his glasses and wanted to ask him his Rx but didn't get that level of courage, and he had finished ringing up my items so I didn't want to hold up those in line behind me.  Anyway it was a nice sighting and a confirmation of my earlier suspicion of his myopia, so thought it worth sharing here.  </p><p> </p><p>Happy New Year's to the Guys in Glasses community.           </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>               </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2012, 19:43</p><p>Thanks Tivo for the post of myopic supermodel guy lying in bed before transitioning to contacts for the day. Nice looking guy, nice looking glasses. THX for sharing, THX for caring.    </p><p> </p><p>Also an update on myself.  In my Thanksgiving Day post I had mentioned that I had just ordered 4 pairs of glasses from Zenni during their BOGO sale.  This was the first time I had ever ordered Rx glasses on line.  Anyhow, they arrived today and I am pleased with the fit and quality. The frames however may be a bit more fashionable than I have used in the past, but that will probably be good for me.  </p><p> </p><p>In case you haven't read my prior posts, I was moderately and progressively more myopic starting in 4th grade and always wore glasses until about 10 years ago when I had lasic, which I came to regret, as I miss being myopic and the connection that brings with other similarly interested myopic guys.  </p><p> </p><p>So during the past years I have worn off the shelf readers, more frequently and with a stronger Rx, but always glasses on for close, off for distance.  So I finally decided to order some bifocals with a mild plus top and stronger lower reading segment. I wore one pair most of the afternoon and they seemed to work well at work (mostly computer work) and in general. The bifocal portion seems well placed. I'll try the look and feel of the other 3 pairs over the next few days, but so far, so good.  </p><p> </p><p>     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2012, 21:54</p><p>Thanks for the post; the content of the video is kind of weird, to me anyway, but still worth a watch.  It's interesting how he starts with his moderate myopic glasses off without a lot of squinting, a bit later moves his face close to the computer screen to read, then puts his glasses on, then removes them again toward the end of the video, all with no mention at all of the glasses.  Thanks again.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sam012744</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2012, 12:10</p><p>Greg, </p><p> </p><p> Thanks for the update. I don't feel GOC is at all about the contacts; for most, if not all, the contacts are merely a means to an end ie. to get to wear stronger/ different prescription glasses and still be able to see properly while doing so. </p><p> </p><p>What do others think? </p><p> </p><p>Sam </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2012, 22:40</p><p>PS; I forgot to mention Jamie's writing, that I referred to in my post, is posted on the Vision and Spex site. Sorry.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2012, 22:37</p><p>Hope your Thanksgiving was good; mine was with family here in Colorado; and safe travels to those of you yet to return to your homes.  While many of us were suffering through our post "ate too much" bloat, our friend Jamie (see prior post) was busy at the keyboard writing down his own personal guys in glasses story, and particularly his interest in bifocals, on himself and on other guys.  As someone more recently out of the closet regarding my OO interest, I am always interested in other guys' stories as to how and when in their lives they became aware of this interest, and how it has influenced their lives (see my earlier "Have You Ever?" post) Thanks Jamie for sharing yours and hope others of you have a chance to read.   </p><p> </p><p>It was kind of a coincidence that I ordered 4 pairs of bifocals from an on-line retailer the day before Thanksgiving. They were having a buy one/get one sale, hence the 4 pairs. A brief recap of my own story, I became interested in mypoic guys fairly early in life but shoved it in the closet,along with other things, even though it often influenced my actions, such as trying to sit next to or befriend a myopic guy. I started wearing glasses in 4th grade and had the normal myopic progression until it stabilized around -7 in college. Fast forward some decades and I had lasik done thinking the closeted myopic fetish would go away. Wish I would have known some of you guys then to help talk me out of it, as I miss being myopic, but am not going to do GOC as I had no interest in contacts even when I was myopic; always just wore glasses. Having lasik is definitely in my personal top ten list of bad decisions, even though the vision turned out basically normal, but that's how we all learn. Are there any others with this regret?  Anyhow, long story short, I am now needing a mild plus Rx with a close up add, hence the bifocals order. A good friend of mine, who is also a myoguy fan, looked up the frames I ordered and thought I made some good choices, so I appreciate that, and look forward to receiving them in a couple of weeks.   </p><p> </p><p>Thanks again Jamie for sharing your personal story, and O hope others will consider doing so also.                   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gregin Colo</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2012, 21:10</p><p>Thanks again, Minus 10, for the posts you shared. Hope you find even more to share. The "I can see clearly now" video was great: very cute guy showing us his super hot new glasses. Hard to imagine he hadn't replaced his glasses in 18 years. He likely would have had some noticeable Rx increases during that time, so must not have relied on his glasses much at all. Would love to have seen him remove his contacts and then put the glasses on, with those fascinating bare-eyed moments in between.  Too bad he got distracted telling us about chips and dips and trips to the Dairy Queen, but I imagine he was making a general video , not one targeted to us myopmanfans.    </p><p> </p><p>The other guy with the very strong bifocal plus Rx, you have to admire the way he carries on his life (did he say lifeguard training?)with some pretty obvious visual loss, as evidenced by the way he hesitates to remove his glasses to show the lens thickness. I don't know a lot about plus Rx's, nor have the same fascination as I do with minus Rx's, so it would be hard for me to even guess at an Rx for him.  </p><p> </p><p>Thanks again to -10 and to all the guys who share on this site and help keep it interesting and stimulating.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2012, 01:16</p><p>Good story, Greg! Poor guy, but I'm glad it ended ok. Thanks for sharing. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gregin Colo</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2012, 20:56</p><p>This true story happened about 10 years ago, and was related to me shortly thereafter by the person it happened to, a friend of mine named Derrin.  As a bit of background,  Derrin was a bit younger than me, and also a bit more myopic.  I was -7ish at the time, and his glasses were a bit stronger and thicker than my own.  Neither one of us had hi-index lenses;  or ever wore contacts, so were completely glasses dependent, so we rarely saw each other without glasses, but I was always welcomed those chances to try on each others glasses, which I seemed to enjoy more than he did.  Anyway,  I would guess his Rx was likely somewhere -8 to -10, and probably closer to -10.  For the purpose of this story Ill assume -9.5. </p><p> </p><p>Derrin was married at the time and had a couple of great kids, probably then late elementary school age.  He had promised the kids a day-trip to the regional water park, so used a Saturday when his wife was travelling out of state to make good on that.   They made the 45 minute drive to the water park getting there in time for the morning opening to get in the full 10 am to 6 pm day at the park.  Derrins glasses at the time were transitionals, in rather large frames, so figured he didnt need to bring any Rx sunglasses or clip-ons along.  One of the early rides that the kids wanted to go on was a water plume tube about up  2 or 3 stories that shot you down a tube into a large pool of swirling water.  There were warning signs saying to remove any jewelry, accessories, etc and if wearing glasses to make sure you had a safety strap to hold them on tightly, because they couldnt shut the attraction down until the end of the day, to retrieve lost items.  He had not brought a strap along, and didnt want to navigate up the stairs in a bare-eyed blur, so he ascended to the top of the ride with his glasses on, figuring they were heavy enough that they would stay on his face.  </p><p> </p><p>The kids went down the plume first and Derrin followed, soon ending up in the swirling pool.  He soon realized that his world had become an intense blur and he had lost his glasses somewhere on the way down.  His kids, neither myopic at the time, helped him get to the side of the pool and climb out.  He started  to panic realizing the gravity of his situation  and the pending difficulty of getting through the rest of the day in 9.5 bare-eyed blur, until his glasses could be retrieved after the attraction was shut down at the end of the day.  He explained his situation to park management but was reminded of the warning signs about personal items lost on the ride.  Of course there was no way he would drive home, or even get out of the parking lot with his significantly myopic uncorrected vision.   With the kids help they did make a trip out to the car to see if by chance he had left an extra pair in the car, but no such luck.   And with his wife out of state she couldnt bring another pair to him, although, had I known,  I would have volunteered to bring him a spare of my own Rx to least provide some significant degree of correction.   A -2 to3 undercorrection would certainly have been more tolerable than what he was experiencing.   He decided the only thing to do was to squint has way through the day and make the best of it until he could hopefully retrieve his glasses.   On the way back from the car, with his limited vision, he made a mis-step and twisted his ankle so had a double handicap. </p><p> </p><p>The kids were not used to seeing their Dad without his glasses, so he explained to them that they would have to help him see for the rest of the day and they could go ahead and have fun on the safer rides but he wouldnt be able to watch them as close as he would like.   They did go the concession stand and buy some cheap sunnies to help reduce the glare and make the squinting less obvious.   Nonetheless the kids had a fun and safe day, and by the end of the day Derrins eyes were very strained and tired but had somewhat adjusted to the blur.  As soon as the park closed for the day the lost items in the plume pool were retrieved, and Derrins glasses were among those, along with some other glasses  but likely without such a strong Rx.   They were a bit worse for the wear but still very usable.   </p><p> </p><p>As he was telling me about this misfortune a couple of days later,  I was trying to hide my own excitement about what he was sharing with me and how much I would have liked to have been there to help him navigate thru a -9.5 bare-eyed day, and likely would have shared my glasses with him, to at least share the blur of the day, and somewhat lessen his. Being afraid of heights I would noty have gone on the plume ride.  Of course, my own excitement would have been hard to conceal; likely a full towel day.   From then on he always kept a spare pair in the glove box of his car, which I enjoyed when we were travelling together and he would go into a store or something.  Even this many years later, recounting this story brings fond memories......    </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2012, 11:25</p><p>Hi Kevin; from just the side view, it's hard to tell if those are Rx glasses or not, but my guess would be not, as its hard to see much lens thickness, either plus or minus.  A front face view would be helpful to tell if there was any minification (minus Rx) or magnification (plus Rx)of the eyes, and background.  Sorry no definitive answer here.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2012, 06:24</p><p>Went out the other evening to get a Chinese takeaway, and on the way back passed the local fish and chip shop which has a couple of chairs just inside. There was a young guy sitting in one with a pair of glasses on top of his head (short, crisp, fairish hair). Shades, I thought - but at this time of night? Not a bit of it! A quick look as I passed revealed black frames and minus lenses, not strong but not negligible either. As I moved on he got up, came out of the shop, and walked off in the direction I had come from without, as far as I could see, putting his glasses where he could see through them. Why do short-sighted guys not make use of their specs? I suppose he might have been heading for his car, in which case he presumably would need them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;05 Oct 2012, 15:02</p><p>as greginC0lorado requested, i'm going to share some of my earliest memories....all the glasses then, when i was mayby four or five, were steel rimmed and i remember my earliest encounter accompanied by a lurid facination was of a boy named danny, sandy dark blond hair, teenage thick, strong glasses, not plano in front, steel rimmed of course and they made his eyes ever so small....they glimmered and then i remember my grandmother talking about them when i was sitting on her knee and i was lapping it up, no pun intended...later on in grade school, maybe around second or third grade my second discovery of a boy with very simular glasses and he was a loner, older who cut thru class rooms and seemed to not be part of the school regimen....he would pop up now and then over the years with his shinny glasses , he definitely was a true truant...but nevertheless there he would be from time to time....these are the only two note worthy sightings in my earlier years, until i came to n.y.c. in my early 20's or late teens and it was there that the fun began...a black boy in the village with very thick , now plastic rimmed glasses, another, white boy with big horn rimmed specs with lots of pronounced power rings...after all that it never stopped, just getting better and better all the time.....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;02 Oct 2012, 20:11</p><p>I am always interested/curious about how/when other guys first discovered/became aware of their interest in Guys with Glasses, so I will post my own story in that regard, hoping that might encourage others to do the same.   </p><p> </p><p>For me, prior to grade 2, no really recollection of anything about glasses. It hit big time grade 2.  A friend of mine had a big brother who drove us to school at times.  Big Brother had glasses like I had never seen before; thick and shiny and things looked very tiny.  That fascinated me to no end.  Dating myself, this was before cars had seat belts in the back so I was able to scoosh around a bit and try to peak thru those thick lenses, and he was a guy to boot. I felt something during those 5 minute rides that I had never felt before.  He soon left for the military (I heard he wanted Air Force but got Army instead because of his eyes; didn't know quite what it meant but it seemed exciting) so no more rides with him, but I was hooked, just didn't know or understand it at the time, like many things in my life. </p><p> </p><p> Now to grade 3, two guys got glasses, one that made things (and his eyes) look smaller, the other that made things (and his eyes) look bigger, my fascination definately with the former. Always tried to get behind him in lunch line to get a glimpse of his tiny world, even though his glasses were likely not all that strong.  One day he was without them, broken he said, so I was curious about what he was able to see, so tried to watch him even more closely that day, especially when he asked the teacher to move to the front of the class so he could see the lessons better.  Thought that was pretty ballsy to admit he needed to move froward to better see the board.  I admired him for that not fully realizing I should also be moving closer to the front.  Grade 4, routine school eye exam, and I also needed glasses, don't remember the power or it meant nothing for me, but guessing -1.5 to -2, seems reasonable for a first myopic Rx.  Was marvelled about how much better I could see.  By then more guys were getting their initial minus scripts, always hoped someone would want to swap glasses with me, but no one ever did and I was not brave enough to suggest that with anyone.  One days my glasses were "misplaced" at home (actually someone hid them for me) so I was forced to go to school without them. so I could understand the blur of the guy the year before. I didn't have the courage to ask to move closer but the teacher must have noticed my squinting so she asked me to.  By the time I got home, my Mom had found my glasses so that was only experience being without my glasses for a longer period than I wanted.  </p><p> </p><p>From then, my Rx and myopcession continued to increase.  The Rx eventually stabilized, myopcession didn't. Teenage years, "xxx dreams" were always about guys (that should have been a clue, but I was still clueless, and have been much of my life). in their glasses, always one that made things look tiny (later leaned the term minus power, etc, etc, etc). </p><p> </p><p>Here's hoping to hear for some of the rest about the history of your own myopcession.                  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2012, 10:42</p><p>A nice Saturday morning myoguy sighting worth sharing.  Was out running around to a few yard sales this morning before beginning more productive activities for the day. At one house I stopped at, the seller was a tallish, quite attractive guy probably right around 40 y/o.  Enhancing his already attractiveness were the super stylish high minus glasses that he was sporting on his face.  They were the newer wrap around style with bronze color metal frames.  With the wrap around it was hard guess the Rx but the thickness and reflection would cause me to guess at least high single digits.  I got up the courage to say "Hey man, I really like your glasses, quite stylish," hoping that might encourage some related conversation from him, but it didn't.  All I got was one of those "what?" kind of looks. I wanted to ask if I could snap a picture of him, but didn't summon that level of courage.  Nontheless, I did linger at that sale a bit longer than I otherwise might have, and looked around at his sale stuff a little more closely just in case he had some old glasses in there.  No such luck, but still a nice way to begin the day.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2012, 07:38</p><p>And thank you Tivo, your kindness and concern toward this significantly myopic man is no doubt greatly appreciated,  and is what makes the world a better place for all of us.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2012, 07:06</p><p>thankyou gregincolo for your comment..here is a before and after foto set of my freind john...the high index glasses are a result of several pairs that i found at a flea market in tampa, and most of them are very close if not exact in prescription to john's.....the first low index cr 39's are what he was wearing when i first met him...he only occasionally wears them now......https://picasaweb.google.com/105066828604706326817</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Scott (different one)</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2012, 05:46</p><p>I sometimes see a man sitting outside a pub in Camden(north London) who wears myo- disc lenses that look quite thin, </p><p> </p><p>He seems to have two pairs, probably distance and reading,but I,ve also seen him take his glasses off to use an iPad, and to operate the screen with his nose.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gregincolo</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2012, 01:00</p><p>Jack, one more thought to ponder if you would.  If it would be in your comfort zone to share some of your optical history, with us, both the challenges and the rewards, I am sure others of us would find that quite interesting.  Or if doing that by email would be more acceptable, let me know.  Thanks. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gregincolo</b>&nbsp;24 Sep 2012, 19:57</p><p>Welcome Jack and thanks for sharing you thoughts with us, especially the suggestion about talking with a guy about his glasses rather than just secretly wondering about them.  I hope you will consider sharing a picture sometime. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Sep 2012, 12:52</p><p>Jim suggested I should post here. It doesn't upset me, at all, that many men find guys in powerful minus glasses attractive. If guys use contact lenses to be able to wear thick glasses I am flattered. </p><p>Some of us who have to wear these type of glasses also feel similar feelings to those described in previous posts. I am really attracted to Jim when he wears his thick myodiscs with GOC. </p><p>Please feel free to chat to any guy you see wearing thick glasses. He has most probably accepted long ago his need and may well welcome open discussion. He could even get turned on by your attention. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;24 Sep 2012, 04:23</p><p>it's been interesting all the chat about us as a minority and our coming out at least unto one another in this cyber media, which has made it feel safer to be ourselves......i wonder sometimes if we are really indeed a minority or simply a minority that has reached out....interesting also is the phasing out of the elements that facinated us so, particularly if you are my age (80) and find less and less really notiiable glasses with solid thickness and power rings......i have been fortunate like many of you have related in that i have encountered over the years a lot of guys with really strong glasses......my lover of 12 years now, who is 20 years my junior, although we don't live together we are still commited.........and i have to add that the guy who i have referred to as john from tampa, who still sports the thickest and strongest glasses i have ever seen on a guy, maybe with the exception of one person way back.....john and i continue to become closer and i have to add that he is not a person that is easy to get to know or will he generally show any trust at any level, but he little by little he is......surprisingly he has allways allowed me to take fotos of him and the other day i did my frst videl of him....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;24 Sep 2012, 02:10</p><p>Greg; although power rings and minification have their own appeal (as my home-made screensaver shows!) I'm less selective: any g/l guy with well-chosen glasses does it for me...see my recent postings about two cute foureyed cashiers at Tesco. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p>-0^0- </p><p>Spexy guys are sexy guys.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2012, 23:54</p><p>Here are a couple more: </p><p> </p><p>1. Have you ever gone on a date or two with a guy who didn't wear glasses, and then went to his house/apartment, and needed to use the restroom, at which point you took the opportunity to check the bathroom for contact lens/glasses paraphernalia? And, on a rare lucky occasion, did you find seriously thick glasses in a case next to contact cases and solution? And then did you try those glasses on (removing your own contact lens to check the RX if you're very myopic yourself)? </p><p> </p><p>2. Or, did you go on a couple of dates with a guy, and then on the third date, he shows up with coke-bottles on, tiny-eyed? You heart skips beats while you pretend to be nonchalant, while you are suddenly extremely excited and ten times more attracted to him? You casually compliment his glasses, and he mentions that his contacts were just so dried out and he needed a rest from them tonight. Lucky you!  </p><p> </p><p>(Yes, both of these have happened to me.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gregincolo</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2012, 22:46</p><p>OOps, forgot one: </p><p> </p><p>Have you ever... </p><p> </p><p>Wished there could be a gathering, convention, meeting,or whatever you envision it to be, of high myopic guy (himyguy)fans. Another poster also posted this possible desire earlier, but I have also have often thought about this, thinking there had to be others than me with this fascination?  </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gregincolo</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2012, 22:38</p><p>Have you ever.. </p><p>1) Been in a store;  you spot a good looking (g/l) himyguy (high myopic guy)and adjust your shopping pattern to better match his, including making sure you are in the checkout line behind him (even though other lines are open)? </p><p>2) Been leaving a store and g/l himyguy walks toward the store;  you remember what you forgot (or didnt) and ( repeat 1 above)?. </p><p>3) Been waiting for a cashier/teller/attendant, etc and notice one to be a g/l himyguy.  You make sure to go to his line/station and treat him extra nice?  (a win/win) </p><p>4)Been in a restaurant and you waiter is a g/l himyguy;  the service is good with a lot of nice small talk; you are a little extra generous with the tip? (another win/win) </p><p>5)Been waiting for a haircut with only one stylist on duty; youre up next; a g/l himiguy walks in and seems in a bit of a hurry; youre not, so you offer him your slot and enjoy watching him squint his way through the haircut ? (another win/win)   Youre secretly wondering what would happen if the stylist lost his glasses?.   </p><p>6) Been driving or biking down a road and notice a g/l himyguy out for a walk or run; you take an extra loop around the block, or maybe two if he is shirtless? </p><p>7)Seen a g/l himiguy couple (yes ,both himyguys) and wonder if they consider their myopia an attraction or a distraction to their relationship; you also wonder if they leave their glasses on during times of intimacy or go bare-eyed?.   </p><p>8)Been at your optometrist and get aroused waIting for the Doc knowing there is a g/l himyguy in the next room and wishing you could see that exam as it took place; or wished that you would chosen optometry as a career, but realizing that may have been too obvious?  </p><p>9)Strolled thru optical stores hoping to see a g/l himyguy trying on frames with his face pretty close to the mirror?  Youre secretly wishing he would ask you to help him select a frame.   </p><p>10) Lingered in the locker room a bit longer when you notice glasses cases or contact supplies on the counter hoping to watch a himyguy switch between the two?  (see my true locker room story in an earlier post.) </p><p>11)Seen a g/l himyguy with his glasses off, (shower.sauna, just rubbing his eyes,use your imagination, etc) and wishing you could experience his vision for a bit; wanting to ask him what he can really see or not but you dont, dont want to seem weird. </p><p>12)Wonder what it might be like for a himyguy to have to go bare-eyed in a strange setting for the better part of a day? (stay tuned for a future true story post on this).   </p><p>13) Had lasik surgery and wish you wouldnt have as you truly miss the myopic connection? </p><p>14) Been attracted to a guy because of his myopia? </p><p>15) Thought you were the only one with a fascination for himyguys and once you realize there are others that you can connect with in this regard, you wonder about theirs stories as to how, when, where they became aware of this fascination as how it has affected their lives?  (I will have a more detailed post on this sometime in the future)  </p><p> </p><p>I can answer yes to each of the above, as well as some others better shared in private. How about it guys, any others of you done any of the above, or have any himyguy "have you evers?" you might want to share?  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

It's good to know there are others who have this fascination and can talk with one another about it, and possibly share pictures, stories, etc.  Congratulations on expanding your comfort zone to be able to take the big step to open up and share this important part of your (and others of us) life and of who you are.

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2012, 14:01</p><p>I am always interested/curious about how and when other guys developed or became aware of their interest in myopic guys,  so I will be sharing my personal story on this in the near future now that I am more comfortable that I am not the only one in the world with this unusual, but exciting, fascination.  Philip and Scott, I am pretty similar to you guys in how I "handle" this fascination, so if you would want to chat or exchange some of your favorite pictures sometime, I would be open to that, although I am away from the computer much of the day, probably a good thing.

<p><b>scott</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2012, 05:44</p><p>After years of reading both the old/new eyescene posts and all vision-and-spex messages I have come out of the woodwork and posted myself for the first time. </p><p> </p><p>Jim your experiences with the -29 guy has made me very jealous. My experiences are restricted to wearing medium goc glasses at home and going onto every link published on this thread on eyescene. Over the years I have downloaded hundreds/ thousands of images and printed many. The twelve best pictures of hunky sexy guys in thick glasses, all but one are high minus, have been framed and hang in my bedroom. </p><p>My own real experience is with the goc at home. I've never actually had enough courage to chat to a real myope but admit to having followed plenty around shopping malls just to get that extra glimpse. At home I put in my contacts and enjoy the minus 11 glasses infront of the twelve pictures. They are stimulating and I am sure many guys understand how they bring gratification.  </p><p> </p><p>Jim I can only imagine what will happen tonight. Enjoy every minute. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gregin Colo</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2012, 18:14</p><p>Thanks, Tinyeyes, for your feedback; glad you enjoyed the recount of my locker room experience where a fairly myopic guys was bare-eyed for a bit longer than he expected. It was kind of stimulating to remember it in enough details to put it into writing to share.  Speaking of words, some of your comments about the guys you post on the GWTG site are just about as hot, and stimulating, as the pictures themselves.  </p><p>Please keep up the good work. I do have another true-life story of a higher myopic guy forced to go bare-eyed for most of a day, that I need to get put on paper to share with others. </p><p> </p><p>Jim, thanks for you sighting of cute -29 guy in London.

<p><b>Jim</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2012, 10:47</p><p>Just been on London Underground. Since the Olympics people chat to eachother more. I sat next to a beautiful guy with short dark hair, tanned complexion, slim build wearing very tight and revealing trousers. My eyes moved upward to his face. He had the thickest minus glasses I'd ever seen, all the usual attributes, cut-in, power rings and lens thickness. Best of all, the tiniest squint when he looked around. Aroused and excited I was desperate to chat to him. When he turned to me and started to converse it was heavenly. After some time I gathered the courage to ask about his glasses. Myopic since a little boy, now aged 27, he wears minus 29D myos, and for real. </p><p>He gave me his phone number, omg. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tnyeyes</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2012, 08:43</p><p>Wow, the locker room story is great!  Things like this don't happen too often. I know it was a frustrating time for the guy, and I don't wish that on him (since the same thing could easily happen to me) but the silver lining was that it was an exciting experience for you (and you helped him.) Even if a made up story, this is good, but it almost sounds "stranger than fiction". Thanks for sharing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gregin Colo</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2012, 20:32</p><p>I wanted to share an interesting happening of recent.  I went to my gym a little later than normal as I didnt have to work that day.  One area of the gym has an oval track that is 1/16 of a mile, so I usually walk it every morning 16 times to get a mile in;  I dont run much anymore due to my middle aged knees.  Inside the oval are cardio machines and around the outer edge of the oval are various weight machines, so I try to include some of each in my workout.  While I would like to say I go the gym to keep in shape, thats just part of it.  I also like to see myopic (the more so the better) guys working out in their glasses or switching from contacts to glasses or visa-versa.  </p><p>That day, just as I was getting ready to leave, a nice looking guy, Im guessing mid-40s came in wearing some quite attractive, but pretty powerful glasses, I would guess around -10s, give or take a diopter or two either way.  He settled into one of the weight machines outside the track so I decided to walk an extra mile or two, since I didnt have to rush off to work.   I tried to make some eye contact with him on my laps around but he seemed more interested in his workout .  After about 20 minutes, I noticed he was gone, so I decided to head to the showers (one large room with about a dozen showerheads) just in case he was also showering.   Sure enough, he was in there but with no sign of his glasses, and just the two of us in the shower room as the normal morning rush has already passed.    Given my own situation I was hoping I could see him better than he could me, which proved to be the case with how close he had to stick has face to the wall to see the soap/shampoo dispenser.   I was presuming he left his glasses in the sink area outside the shower room, as guys often do, but I hadnt noticed them there.    He left the shower area, so I made sure my towel was tightly in place and did the same.   He was in the locker bank across the aisle from mine so I could see as he squinted his nose into the various lockers looking for his clothing, and probably most importantly, his glasses.  I could tell he was becoming frustrated/panicked so decided to see if I could assist, so I walked across the aisle, still holding my towel firmly in place, introduced myself, and asked if he needed help.   He said he was certain he had left his clothes (both gym and street) , keys , and glasses, in one of those lockers but now could not find them, and could not see very well  at all without his glasses, which is why he usually didnt even bring a lock in.   </p><p> </p><p>felt sorry for the guy but was also excited about the situation, keeping good hold on my own towel.  He never offered his name back, but I told him I would quickly dress  and see what I could do to help him.  Again I was glad the locker room was pretty empty and he could not see me very well.  While I quickly dressed, he continued to peer his face  into the various lockers, but no success.   I then explained to him that I could sympathize with his situation as I used to be pretty myopic myself, before lasik (yes, a mistake).   I asked him if he had extra glasses or contacts, or clothes, in his car that I could retrieve for him.  He said he hadnt been able to wear contacts for a couple of years and he did have prescription sunglasses in the car but his keys were in the same place as his clothes and glasses.  His myopic lack of focus seemed to be of great frustration to him, and would be expected for someone of his script, so I asked him if he lived nearby and I could go retrieve spare glasses or a spare set of keys from his spouse or roommate.  No, he lived alone, he said.            </p><p> </p><p>We finally concluded that likely someone else had accidently snapped their lock shut on the locker where his stuff was , as there were occupied but unlocked lockers of either side of the one he thought was his, but which had a lock on it.   I offered to go ask club management to make an announcement so see if we could find the lock owner.   Just then, another guy walked up, realized his mistake, apologized ,  and quickly opened the locked locker.  Sure enough, there were Myoguys  clothes, keys, and most importantly to him, his glasses;  I never saw someone so happy to get their glasses back on their face.  He dressed quickly and mumbled a thanks.  I asked him if he wanted to grab a coffee, but he said he needed to get on his way, likely still feeling pretty embarrassed, which I tried to downplay.   I was hoping I might run into him again sometime, but havent, but this definitely made for an exciting day at the gym, as well as some interesting memories.                 </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2012, 08:46</p><p>I really enjoy a TV quiz game called Blockbusters which is shown on the Challenge channel here in the UK. At the moment they're showing editions from 1992, which are far more fun than the series of new ones they put on a few months ago. These old ones have senior school kids as contestants (so they must now be in their late 30s!) and the winners got great prizes for themselves and sometimes for their schools as well. A single player competes against a team of two; and for a while this week all three contestants were boys with glasses - round glasses, all of them, and all different! The single player (short dark hair) had retro round tortoiseshell frames, with, I think, a low minus Rx. One of the others (untidy shoulder-length dark hair) had black wire frames with a high joint, and his partner, definitely the cutest of the three, had short dark hair and  low joint gold frames, like Harry Potter's but without the black covering. What's more, in due course the single guy was eliminated and was replaced by a girl who also wore round glasses - big gold frames and plus lenses. Oh well, it was good while it lasted!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2012, 11:33</p><p>Shopping in Tesco this afternoon, I spotted another good-looking guy with glasses manning a till. I wasn't able to join the line for him to deal with my few purchases; but I did manage a look at him. He was slim and fairly tall with short dark hair, and his glasses had wire fronts (I think), black temples with a white line running along the bottom edge, and minus lenses, not negligible. A nice sight.</p><p></p><hr>

The -30 in the videos is so hot, but then again, so are so many of the others.  I have begun to appreciate, more and more, all of the Asian guys here in S.F. who are so amazingly myopic and good-looking, too.  My next door neighbor has just returned from three months in Taiwan and looking better than ever in his new glasses.  I'll bet he's at least a -11 in his left eye and at least a -10 in the right.  Totally hot in a nerdy sort of way.  And as for the guy who takes care of my car ... well, what can I say.  He's so cute and his glasses kind of put the frosting on the cake.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2012, 11:08</p><p>Julian, </p><p>For the "upper half" half glasses to work really well, the Rx needs to be very nearly the same in both eyes, little or no astigmatism, and an Rx of -2.50 or less. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2012, 10:56</p><p>I've just been away for a few days in a group led by two guys in their early fifties. The cuter one (fair hair, dimples) wore rimless glasses with a low minus prescription and usually took them off to read. The other also wore rimless glasses, also minus and a bit stronger, which he never seemed to take off; BUT the lenses were shallow/narrow from top to bottom and he wore them high on his nose, so that he was looking under them to read, rather like half-moon readers in reverse - logical enough, but this is only the second time I've seen anyone use minus glasses that way</p><p></p><hr>

He was a big butch guy, not a beauty in any way, but very pleasant and efficient. I did however find his glasses interesting. The frames were fairly ordinary in shape, in dark blue wire, but the lenses fascinated me. As I watched him at work, there would be minification at one moment and magnification at the next - a clear case of mixed astigmatism (plus in one meridian and minus at right angles to it). </p><p>Later the same day I went to a supermarket filling station for fuel, and the cashier was a delicious young man: pale complexion, dark hair, moderate minus lenses in black wayfarer frames - quite made my day!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2012, 10:59</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>tinyeyes -- If you want to replicate a -34's visual "experience" why don't you buy some +20 contacts on-line which would give you an approximately -30 prescription. I'm sure that you'd find that you'd only see blobs and that your nighttime vision would be nearly non-existent. </p><p> </p><p>If you wanted to correct your "new" vision with glasses and by factoring in a vertex distance requiring another -4 of lens strength, you'd probably be replicating Mr. -34s visual experience pretty closely without his very high astigmatism of -6.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2012, 12:27</p><p>tinyeyes, </p><p>Thanks.  You might be able to get an idea of the difference in uncorrected blurriness by trying on the strongest readers you can find without your glasses.  However, the very best way would be to ask your Eye Care Professional to let you try some +10 lenses in his trial frame and then some +20s or the highest + lenses he has.  With your Rx, the +20s would be pretty close to needing -30 glasses.  While you might see some difference, I really doubt you would be able to identify any unfamiliar object at any distance other than very close without correction. </p><p>If you get a chance to try it, please let us know your impressions of significantly more uncorrected myopia than you have. </p><p>Remember that optically, all glasses or contacts do is neutralize or cancel out existing refractive errors.  In your case, your eye's optical system has about 8 dippers (with adjustment for vertex distance) more plus than it needs to focus an images on your retina and your minus lenses cancel that out.  To simulate higher myopia, you just need some additional external plus from either contacts or glasses.  Contacts would really be best, but trial lenses work just fine. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2012, 00:06</p><p>Thanks, Cactus Jack.  </p><p>OK, here's my latest eyeglass RX: </p><p>OD -9.5-.75 x 180  </p><p>OS -9.25-.50 x 180 </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2012, 06:44</p><p>tinyeyes, </p><p>Once an image gets really blurry with just some colored blobs, more blurry doesn't make much difference.  A -20 eye focuses at 5 cm or about 2 inches.  A -34 eye focuses at about 3 cm or just a bit over an inch.  With that much myopia, it is very likely that the eyeball is significantly elongated and the retina is not a perfectly smooth section of a sphere.  On top of that, vertex distance effects in glasses would be about 0.4 diopters per mm at -20 and over 1 diopter per mm at -34 so keeping the glasses at the correct distance from the cornea can be a problem.  Of course, any correction would be better than none.  -20 contacts are available on line and higher values can be custom made.  Theoretically, contacts should be better than glasses, at least for a significant part of the correction, because they are on the surface of the cornea.  A better solution would be internal "contact" lenses because the lenses are closer to the optimal location within the eye and there is little or no vertex distance caused minification of the images. </p><p>If you could provide your Rx, I might be able to suggest an experiment so you can get a better idea of what is going on visually, with high myopia. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2012, 00:17</p><p>Thanks for the insight, Dave. Very interesting.... so the vision without correction isn't that different, but the vision with glasses is. It sort of makes sense. At -34, the distortion and minification are so extreme, it would be difficult to deal with for sure. I would think contacts, even gas permeable, would be very thick and uncomfortable at that level of RX. From what I understand, the edge of the contact lens has a limit of how thick it can be, and of course at -34 would need to be very thick indeed. The lens would have to have an edge without prescription around the edge so it could be thinner, similar to the myodisc eyeglasses also needed at this level. I don't know if that's possible with gas perms or with soft lenses, or with either. I guess this is the wrong forum for such technical questions. At any rate, -34 is a very interesting RX! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2012, 16:14</p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes -- I'd expect that there's no significant visual difference between an uncorrected -20 and an uncorrected -34: you just can't see much of anything.  The difference corrected is where the rubber meets the road.  There's no way Mr. -34 could have normal vision with glasses, and I doubt he could drive.  That said, everyone is different and a couple of people I know who are in their low -20s see pretty well -- well enough to drive with glasses and not contacts.  Speaking of contacts, I'm sure they're available in that strength (probably gas permeable, not soft) although he might be one of those people who can't wear them successfully.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2012, 02:36</p><p>Wow. -34, for real? I would like to know more about guys like this. Are they handicapped or do they have normal vision with glasses? Can they drive?  </p><p>With -34, what would the blur without glasses be like? I would think that you literally would have to feel for your glasses. It would be almost like being blind. How about contacts? Are they a possibility? At what RX level do they become impractical? I would certainly enjoy spending some time with Mr. -34. As extreme as it is, I'm sure these stratospheric RXs are more common in Asia. </p><p></p><hr>

BTW, mixed in with all of the Chinese is a rather unusual -- but good-looking -- white guy with incredibly thick myodiscs.  Must be well past -20 and might be more like -25.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2012, 15:02</p><p>If a person is very myopic, it is reasonable that they may need minus glasses to read at a comfortable distance.  For example, if a person needs to wear -10 glasses, that would mean that anything beyond 10 cm or 4 inches would be very blurry.  There is more to reading at distance of 10 cm or 4 cm than just focus.  Your eyes have to converge quite a bit to fuse the images of a page at that distance.  It may not be very comfortable.  Even wearing -5.00 glasses to read would move the near point focus out to 20 cm or 8 inches which would make reading a lot easier. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2012, 09:50</p><p>Tivo - I have also always found it interesting that he only puts his glasses on to read when it's obvious that they are not reading glasses but rather myopia glasses. I bet he can't even see the camera without them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;11 Apr 2012, 09:38</p><p> </p><p>tinyeyes -- many thanks for the great photos.  Please keep on posting!!  BTW, I had an amazing siting in the Castro:  a mid-thirties, dark-haired handsome white guy with myodiscs nearly identical to those worn by that fellow with the Mohawk on your Tumblr site.  I'd say they were at least -20, very thin (may have been high-index glass)and the bowls were about 25mm.  The carriers were plus which really emphasized the power of his prescription.  A rough guesstimate, I admit, but probably pretty close to what he was wearing.  My only regret was that he was dining with friends and not at the bar on his own where I might have been able to chat him up.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2012, 11:54</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tivo -- Thanks for sharing your collection! They're definitely last year's models but really interesting examples of the world of the high myope before high-index lenses.  BTW, the picture of that black guy you posted a while back probably was wearing glasses with CR-39 lenses, too.  They're seriously strong but the lens material and the oversize frames have exaggerated their strength.  -15, perhaps?   </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Julian -- Nice sighting.  There are a couple of major lookers in my athletic club who do the same thing.  Real jocks who probably haven't even figured out that they might need correction. Probably hovering around -.75. Nothing serious but a small television set perched a good distance away from the sofa can challenge even near-perfect vision.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>I, Glasses</b>&nbsp;02 Feb 2012, 14:52</p><p>I've seen a new ad for McDonald's coffee on TV the past few nights, featuring a man and a woman sitting on a park bench.  He's wearing glasses with black, traditional-shaped frames and an actual prescription, with a cut-in that's noticeable when the camera catches his face from a three-quarter angle.  I'd guess his Rx is about -2 to -3.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Miranda</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2011, 12:53</p><p>I had a nice sighting on my way home for Xmas. On a long flight from the US to Europe I was wearing glasses (~ -7) myself. I am a 99.5% contacts wearer so I always feel a little uncomfortable if I have to.  </p><p>Anyways, the guy sitting next to me was really adorable and had facinating eyes with long lashes. We were talking for a while. When we were close to landing, he pulled some glasses out of his pocket. My heart skipped a beat, I couldn't believe it at first. They were black and huge, roundish nerd style. Not really strong though, -2 or so. This was really a nice surprise and I had to stop myself from staring at him all the time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2011, 00:27</p><p>Those are great sightings too, Dave... Even better is when the gym jock can't wear contacts and shows up one day for a workout in thick glasses... occasionally it happens!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2011, 15:29</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hi tinyeyes -- Yes, that sounds like a great sighting.  This morning in the Mission I spotted a reasonably good-looking Middle Eastern type with -11/-12 glasses in a very trendy "geek-style" frame.  The frame was ever so slightly oversized which really emphasized the power of the lenses.  Flat fronts, of course, and major cut-in. When he looked at his cell phone he got closer than normal to see the screen. Clearly straight as he couldn't take his hands off his g/f.   </p><p> </p><p>Best yet for me are the hot, straight young guys in my club who just haven't acknowledged their myopia.  There are a couple of major dolls who really need a bit of correction who can be seen most days trying not to squint too much at the tv (albeit a small one) in one of our locker room lounges. They always hold their heads back slightly and lower their lids just enough to get things into "better" focus.  Somehow weak eyes doesn't comport with their jock image.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2011, 00:53</p><p>I don't usually post sightings anymore, but at the gym today I had a good one -- tall young (late 20s maybe) Asian guy with VERY thick glasses. I think they were around -14 or -15, and didn't seem to be myodiscs. The lenses were over a quarter inch thick and polished. When I saw him he was finished with his workout, adjusting his glasses, and headed to the locker room. I went in there a few minutes later, and he was taking a shower, with no glasses anywhere in sight, which amazed me because of his strong prescription. I couldn't exactly hang around waiting for him to come out of the shower, although I really wanted to, to see how he would find and put on his glasses. I came back in a few more minutes later, and he was dressed and the coke bottles were on, of course. It was a fantastic sighting -- I don't see attractive guys with prescriptions that strong more than once or twice a year. </p><p></p><hr>

An unusual eye-catcher for me in that he wore a healthy plus prescription (Hard to estimate but perhaps +4.00) in a cute semi-rimless frame with those temples that get wider half way down. </p><p> </p><p>I have to say he looked gorgeous, his eyes magnified, and a handsome body to go with his glasses. I wouldn't have given him so much attention if it wasn't for the glasses. Pleased to be surprised by this plussy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Aug 2011, 04:41</p><p>Royboy: you are so right about Prince William, that's a particularly good shot of him. Three comments:  </p><p>(1) Seems to me he isn't as shy about appearing in public in his glasses as he used to be. Can this be Kate's influence? </p><p>(2) He isn't the only member of his generation of the Royal Family to wear glasses in public - remember his cousin Peter Phillips. </p><p>(3) Are those new glasses in that pic? They look to me like rimless or semi-rimless. As you say, sweet!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;12 Aug 2011, 00:59</p><p>James, totally agree -- there is something so sexy about the bald with glasses look. David King is one of my favorites -- it's the personality and voice (nerdy I guess, but masculine) along with the face and wonderful strong glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2011, 10:22</p><p>Tinyeyes - totally know what you mean. There is a lot of cognitive dissonance when what you find attractive diverges from your brain's logic. I remember thinking Dahmer was cute after watching a documentary about him years ago, and more recently, that JosÃ© Padilla (convicted terrorist) was kinda sexy. </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/images/338619/3_63_012208_padilla3.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.foxnews.com/images/338619/3_63_012208_padilla3.jpg</a> </p><p> </p><p>I guess attraction doesn't conform to rules of logic.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2011, 09:51</p><p>I never heard of Warren Jeffs, but I have to admit I think he's kind of cute. I hate it when scary criminals are attractive (with glasses).

<p><b>Chet</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2011, 10:53</p><p>According to Scriptfinders, Chace Crawford's prescription is OD -5.75 -1.25 x095  OS -6.00 -1.50 x 180 </p><p>He normally wears gas permeable toric lenses</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ksnl</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2011, 01:54</p><p>To me it seems like those were personal pictures of Chace at home that got out somehow... I don't think he would have ordinarily allowed pictures to be taken of him in glasses (except for plano glasses in Esquire magazine), he seems quite vain. </p><p>We need to find some personal pictures of Jake at home... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2011, 22:32</p><p>Oh also, I think Chace's rimless frames are tricky to estimate from those pics. I wish they were -8, but I'm thinking they're probably closer to -5 or -6. I think rimless frames tend to exaggerate the appearance of high power. They could be higher, though. But there is no way they're only -2 or -3. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2011, 22:13</p><p>That's pretty amazing. I'm glad that Chace allowed pics of himself in glasses to go public! I wonder if we'll be treated to more? Now if only we could get Jake Gyllenhaal to do the same! My life won't be complete until I see him in his coke bottles! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2011, 12:54</p><p>Well, I'm pretty good at estimating Rxs, and believe me Chase is very myopic. I'd go with -7 or -8. Those are seriously high index lenses with a lot of cut-in and they make his eyes quite a lot smaller. Uncorrected, he couldn't read small print unless it was four inches away from his face and he'd have difficulty recognising strangers if they were more than three feet away. If those rimless specs are his main pair it must be quite a struggle to find them sometimes. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ksnl</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2011, 11:28</p><p>I thought a bit stronger than that, maybe I am looking from a different angle... but once again, I'm no expert... any other opinions?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2011, 10:03</p><p>I don't wanna dampen the party at all, and am also no expert Rx estimator, but Chace's glasses just look incredibly low minus to me.

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2011, 22:01</p><p>Dave, you're only partly right about LA. There are plenty of guys in strong glasses if you know where to look. Sure, Hollywood and the West Side may be image-obsessed, but there's also, for example, huge Asian areas like Monterey Park that are full of high myopes in glasses.  (hate to bring up the stereotype but...) The great thing about cities like San Francisco is the street life and mass transit so that it's so easy to people-watch.  </p><p> </p><p>Also, I've seen "Strangers on a Train" -- great movie!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2011, 11:04</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>tivosante -- I'd love to take his picture just for myself but he's so shy and would probably think I'd lost my marbles. I don't think he's at all happy being totally dependent on his glasses and never thought they'd get to this level of strength since he only started wearing them in college.  Within 5 years he was a high myope and now an extreme one.  Even without glasses, though, he's so hot. </p><p> </p><p>tinyeyes -- You're right about SF.  LA is so beauty obsessed.  While glasses are a fashion accessory down there they can never be construed as a medical necessity.  You might see some very low minus prescriptions in some very cool frames on some very good-looking people, but rarely do you see something serious in the prescription department.   </p><p> </p><p>BTW, I just saw the last Harry Potter movie (a first for me) and was so annoyed to see those prescription-free glasses of his.  You'd have thought they would have had some sort of script to make them appear real.  Guess most people would never notice, but I sure did, and have always found it annoying that Hollywood wants the look of glasses but never the look of a real pair. (Read Matt Damon).  The one serious exception was Alfred Hitchcock who insisted in his classic movie, Strangers on a Train, that one of the principal actresses wear real glasses even though she didn't need them and was effectively blind with them on.  The real prescription was key when Hitchcock filmed her murder as it was seen through the strong prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2011, 20:37</p><p>Dave, I think SF is heaven for seeing guys with thick glasses, especially Asian since there are so many in the area. And yeah, I meant straight guys in general (regardless of race) who have a strong prescription are more likely than gays to wear their glasses in public. My only point about race is that high myopia does seem to be more prevalent among Asians and Asian-Americans.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2011, 11:39</p><p>hey dave, how's about a pic of your asian freind with his thick glasses, since he's not so concerned about thickness he may be more than willing to stand in front of a camera, particularly if you tell him that his glasses make him even more appealing............good luck...........</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2011, 09:48</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>tinyeyes -- I'm in SF which has always had lots of Asians and many with serious scripts.  I'm always on the lookout but agree with you that the Asian guys with the strongest glasses tend to be straight. Frankly, I think the same holds true for white guys.  Nevertheless, you should see a couple of the Asian boys who live in my building!!  There's also a very cute Eurasian I see downtown all of the time who has made his extremely thick glasses a part of his look. I'd say he's a -14 and wears frames that are a tad too large for his hefty prescription which means the edge thickness is nearly 1/2".  Always a nice sighting!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2011, 18:57</p><p>Dave -- ah I see. Not surprising at all that your friend is straight, but you can still look! Straight guys are much more likely to wear strong glasses. I do like Asians a lot, (I'm white) and one of the reasons is their prevalence of high myopia! From what I understand, double-digit prescriptions are very common in Taiwan and SIngapore as well as elsewhere in Asia. Fortunately a lot of them have been imported to the US!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2011, 16:43</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>tinyeyes -- My Asian pal is very cute and very straight.  6'1" and built.  Oh, well.  Normally I'm not into Asians but when I am ...  His thick lenses really do the trick for me.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2011, 07:07</p><p>Dave, your Asian friend sounds awesome! Does he wear contacts, or glasses full-time? I'm -9.5 and have been in flat fronts for a long time, since I was -8 which is what I've pretty much been since teen years.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2011, 04:55</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I'd say closer to -15.  I was at dinner with a hot Asian friend of mine tonight whose new glasses have finally gone flat-fronted and are -10/-10.5- after a big increase.  He's got the 1.74 index lenses but they've still got some edge thickness and lots of power rings.  I'd say the son of the mafia don has the highest index available in plastic and, yes, he is cute.  Not that he's classically handsome but he does have a lot of appeal and is very manly.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2011, 03:59</p><p>I'm not the best at guessing - I just know strong when I see it! - but I'd say anywhere between -12 and -15. </p><p> </p><p>Hot!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2011, 00:21</p><p>Hmm, Julian Smith is really cute, but he seems to be using the glasses as a prop to make himself look goofy/dumb in the videos. I'm wondering if those glasses are even his. He looks great in them though, although I wish he wouldn't wear them crooked, cross his eyes on purpose and otherwise try to look terrible when he's wearing them. It's for comic effect but to an OO it's not that funny!</p><p></p><hr>

This rather husky black boy, maybe in his early twenties, caught my eye as i drove by a bus stop. Spotting what i believed to be glasses about as Strong as gertz's aviator goggles, but not quite as large and more round, almost surely welfare glasses. </p><p>  </p><p>                                           carefully making a u turn i pulled into a checkers parking lot and walked over to the bus stop just in time to get a closer look at his incredibly strong glasses, very thick on the sides  </p><p>; and he was gone........... </p><p>  </p><p>                                           hoping against...odds that he would be there tomorrow at the same time i returned and parked behind checkers, bought a shake and waited  at an outside table, he showed up pretty much on time and i wasted no time in walking over and almost immediately struck up a conversation about how strong his script was. he responded in both a congenial and  evasive manner. I'm good about glasses chatter and kept the conversation going, talking about contacts, eye surgery, hi index lenses, what ever just to get him to face me a bit. he seemed not to want to make any pronounced eye contact ............... </p><p> </p><p>    </p><p>   </p><p>  </p><p>                                           finally a bus came going  east west instead of north south  to where we were and he hurriedly grabbed  it. i was left alone  wondering  if i scared him off, I can not forget the wonderful image  of those huge dark tortoise shell frames with thick myodisc type lenses  protruding both forward and behind the heavy frames. the inner ring was larger than most myodiscs suggesting a much more powerful script..................... </p><p> </p><p>. </p><p>                                           when i get a chance i will get a foto of him if he will allow me and I'll post it with his permission....................</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;12 May 2011, 12:03</p><p>Myopic Grant, </p><p>I am not 100% sure, but I think the thickness of the cornea and the underlying corneal stroma are important, in addition to the actual Rx.  </p><p>In lasik, they make a corneal flap and fold it back revealing the corneal stroma. A laser is then used to ablate (vaporize) some of the tissue that makes up the stroma to reshape the stroma. The flap is then allow to return to its original position.  If the stroma is not thick enough to allow successful removal of enough tissue to produce the necessary correction, other solutions must be found. </p><p>Consider the process of making a minus lens where the center thickness of the blank is ground away.  The blank itself must be thick enough to allow the full Rx to be ground into the lens and retain enough center thickness to keep the lens from being very fragile.  Essentially, lasik for myopia uses a laser to grind away the center of the stroma to reduce its plus power. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopic Grant</b>&nbsp;12 May 2011, 11:18</p><p>So in regards to the ICL guy; how bad does your vision have to be in order NOT to be considered for lasik?  It looks like he's around a -10, so I wonder what the cut off is.  I know people who were around that range who had the procedure.</p><p></p><hr>

The doctor actually also provided a .75 add (for the first time!) I asked for it, but I think he thought I was still ok without it. I'm ok in contacts for now, but getting to the point where I have to push my glasses down when reading. In recent years my distance rx has gotten about 1D worse, which surprises me going from my 30s into my 40s! My old glasses from a few years ago seem much too weak now! </p><p> </p><p>I haven't had the new glasses made yet -- still deciding whether to hold off on the add. Aging is a reality!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 17:52</p><p>Tinyeyes: Yes, it's true, "opposites attract" and "birds of a feather flock together" can both be valid forces, believe it or not. For example, I am bisexual (I've said here before that I was straight, but that was when I was still coming to terms with being bi, and also I am more hetero where the OO thing is concerned, I don't know why, but maybe it has something to do with that whole "strong guy with 1 weakness" thing) and find that I'm attracted to guys and girls but for different reasons. With guys there is that ever-present allure of the mystery of the unknown, while with girls there is a comfortable sense of intimate familiarity. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 13:19</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes -- I remember that you posted some pictures of yourself in glasses on Flickr (and there were many without) and you looked great in them!  What's your prescription now?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Obsessed</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 10:27</p><p>Hey guys! Thanks for sharing your thoughts :-) It's really fascinating to read about your feelings about strong glasses and, of course, VERY strong glasses ;-)  </p><p> </p><p>I have been fascinated by glasses since I was in the 6th or 7th grade. A friend of mine was prescribed glasses, and his initial RX was stronger than most kids' - I think he was -2.50 or so. For someone who hadn't worn glasses before, it was a significant RX. Most kids would start at -0.5 or -0.75. I remember being endlessly fascinated by realizing that he must have seen things blurry without his glasses and then everything would come into focus whenever he'd put them on. I asked him many questions. We used to play together, and often he would not have his glasses on because he was afraid of scratching them while playing active games. I kept asking him questions about the quality of his vision. Since he was pretty much a full-time wearer at school, he soon became quite dependent on them. It was fascinating to see him start wearing his glasses while playing with kids in the yard after school (we lived in the same neighborhood). I asked him why he was now wearing his glasses all the time and almost died when I heard the answer "I can't really see well without them".  </p><p> </p><p>The next thing I did was simulate myopia. My mom was a medical person, so I found her college textbooks and read about myopia and other refractive errors. I managed to trick 2 doctors into believing I had myopia, but my mother figured me out, so I didn't get lucky and didn't get glasses. I was so depressed - I wanted them so badly.  </p><p> </p><p>At a young age, I was only attracted to myopic people. I was fascinated by my friends glasses, but I didn't feel any sexual attraction for him as a guy. Even when we were in high school. I was always into older men. Like, significantly older - usually over 40. I actually love men over 50 and 60, as well :-) I occasionally get attracted to men who are in their late 20's or early 30's, but that's not typical.  </p><p> </p><p>I love myopia. I do wear glasses myself now (been wearing them for 3 years and am at -2 now). I have huge frames and my lenses are low index - that gives me a chance to have some power rings even with my mild RX.  </p><p> </p><p>I have recently developed a crazy fetish for presbyopia. With only one restriction: there must be a distance RX and it must be plus, as well. Seeing a man over 40 (or, preferably, even over 50) with a plus distance RX and a line at the bottom of the lenses indicating an add - it just drives me nuts. I can stalk a guy like that around a store for a long time. I don't know where it came from, but there's something endlessly hot about that for me.  </p><p> </p><p>When in bed, I like to imagine (while having sex) how poorly my man sees things wihtout his glasses and how he's able to focus with them on his face. I absolutely LOVE the face distortions that glasses create. They are insane sexy in my opinion :) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 09:26</p><p>All4Eyes -- good point about how some high myopes are OOs but most aren't. I have no idea why either. I can tell you that almost all of the high myopes I have been interested in or dated had no interest in my myopia at all.  The whole thing is sort of analogous to the "opposites attract" thing: most people seem to like someone very different from themselves, even when the same sex. Dark skinned with light skinned, skinny with big, etc. -- you see it all the time. But you also see the guys who are paired up who look like twins or brothers -- both muscle bunnies with blond hair, etc. But that's less common. I fall somewhere in between. I definitely am attracted to other races and body types, but I also like commonalities -- guys close to my own age (although the older I get the less true this is!) and guys who are myopic. I think this psychological stuff we all carry is pretty complicated.  </p><p> </p><p>James - I totally agree with you about seeing someone in glasses for the first time, when you had seen them previously in contacts. Nothing is hotter!!! I've mentioned this frequently on this site before. Sometimes it was a guy I knew, and sometimes it was someone I just saw frequently, like at the gym. Best of all it was when someone I dated suddenly appeared in strong glasses, or when I was at their house and discovered contact cases and coke bottles in the bathroom. Extremely exciting! And I totally agree about the contrast between hot masculinity and the vulnerability of powerful minus glasses. I also agree with you in that I personally am less attracted to disability.  </p><p> </p><p>One more thing -- yes, I am "really" myopic. I am so self-conscious about my strong prescription that I never wear my glasses in public, even though I yearn for other guys to do so! Weird, isn't it? You'd probably think that a high myope who is an OO would want to wear glasses constantly. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 07:51</p><p>Tivo - I know what you mean! I have lost count of the number of times I;ve stalked high myopes round supermarkets and shops. The other day I got on a subway in the wrong direction because I was so entranced by this high minus, hot young guy. Luckily, I always manage to stop myself before it gets into truly creepy or even illegal territory. </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes - makes perfect sense. Funny thing is, I always got the impression from you (may be totally wrong, not sure where I got the idea) that you were not so super in love with being a high myope yourself, that you were ambivalent about it. This is how I definitely know you are real, since I find it hard to imagine true high myopes who are just toally ecstatic, without ANY reservation, about being highly nearsighted (knowing its pitfalls and all it means in day to day life). </p><p> </p><p>So for me it's very interesting that you find it hot in others, having such an intimate understanding of what it means at a practical level. For me, as i said, I love the vulnerability, and there is also a sense of the unknown for me, as a very low, even pseudo myope. </p><p> </p><p>What I DO realise (from my experience of the -19 guy) is that the myopia must not be at the level of a disability. The -19 guy, while certainly not low vision, did not seem to have good acuity, e.g. struggled to find the latch to open the door etc etc. From this, it dawned on me that I am attracted to myopes who are otherwise rugged and masculine in every other way, but have this one thing - their eyesight - where they are vulnerable. So while I want them to be utterly dependent on the glasses/contacts, they must be able to see well with them. Disability is just no turn on for me (I know it is for some people, no judgement of course!) </p><p> </p><p>While I'm doing rambling stream-of-consciousness anyway, here's another thing I like (sure I've mentioned it before): while I love once off sightings of thick glasses, the absolute best is when someone I know turns up one day in super-thick lenses, and all the time I have known them until that point, I had no idea they were seeing through strong contacts. It is somehow so intimate and personal, such a revelation of personal vulnerability or weakness.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 02:15</p><p>Tinyeyes: Sure it makes sense! I feel the same. I think there is an intimate sense of commonality between 2 myopes, especially with the need to get close to see each other clearly. But that doesn't explain why some myopes are OO and others aren't. And for ppl with perfect vision, there is an air of mystery to the world of myopes, an intriguing "other" they know they'll never fully understand.  But that doesn't explain why some non-myopes are OO and others aren't.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;05 May 2011, 00:32</p><p>For me, the answer is also that I like being with the guy both with and without glasses. I'm most attracted to seeing them with their thick glasses on,  but I have also been extremely aroused by seeing a guy grope around for his glasses, or having that blank look in his eyes that can't focus. I have had this fetish for so long, and I still don't really know why I have it. Of course, since I am a high myope myself, it obviously has something to do with that, but I still don't understand why I find it sexy. I think part of it is the intimate feeling of being close with someone without glasses and seeing each other at close range with our nearsighted eyes, and the brotherhood feeling of waking up together blind and putting on our glasses. If we both wear contacts most of the time, it's all the better -- it's our private world where we are transformed with our thick glasses, and unembarrassed and uninhibited by them since we both need them.

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;04 May 2011, 16:09</p><p>james, i too have have had great rushes over sightings, one just recently at a local super market, almost losing all control i would lurk around this guy with what i believed to be a -18 more or less; and i would try to stand behind him where i could look thru his glasses to see what was on the other side, and sideways to catch the power rings , straight on to see the depth and width of the cut. it became a majer obsession with me the whole time i was in the store as a matter of fact i went back in again on the  pretext that i had forgotten something on my shopping list, just to see him again, a very dark skinned guy, black, not bad looking....i finally got myself together and got out of there,but was quite hot for sometime....no i don't fantasize about his losing his glasses or seeing him take them off and put them back on...i do get a rush from feeling the lenses, especially thick ones....thanks for sharing about your fantasies...i could go on about other things, but don't want to take up the room here....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;04 May 2011, 07:41</p><p>not ignoring you post james, just have to think about it awhile...meanwhile -29 is back with the wildest ever.....   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/75gertz#p/u/3/JtrgksQX1_U" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/user/75gertz#p/u/3/JtrgksQX1_U</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;04 May 2011, 03:03</p><p>This fetish is so constrained to fantasy for me, I can;t even say definitively what I would do. Case in point: I recently had an, ahem, encounter with a super-high minus guy. He was -19 (born with Marfan's Syndrome), CRAZY thick glasses (not myodisc if you can believe it, but really bevelled at the edges). When it came to the crunch, i.e. fantasy intersecting with reality, I really kind of froze up and didn't know what to do. It was still a hot experience, but not because of me taking charge in any way....he ended up taking the glasses off, then later looked at a text message with one eye shut and the phone basically touching his face. </p><p> </p><p>The experience made me think more deeply about this glasses obsession and what it is based on. There is certainly a vulnerability element to it - that a really masculine guy has to depend on glasses to see - but it is more than that and has elements I can't explain. </p><p> </p><p>I know my fantasy would involve taking his glasses off, and then seeing his try to cope without them. The fantasy would also involve him putting them on again and having that "I can see" moment again.  </p><p> </p><p>But I can't say in reality whether a) I would do those things or b) they would actually be a turnon. </p><p> </p><p>So basically, the most non-commital answer ever!!!! How about you guys?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 May 2011, 21:53</p><p>So I was thinking, Obsessed and James, and anyone else that cares to answer -- </p><p>If you could be with this guy in the photos and do whatever you want with him (provided he was mutually consenting) would you prefer him to take his glasses off, leave them on, take them off for him... ?  Just wondering.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Obsessed</b>&nbsp;03 May 2011, 17:58</p><p>But damn - he's extremely hot with a pretty extreme RX :) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Obsessed</b>&nbsp;03 May 2011, 17:57</p><p>I was wondering about the wife. I most certainly hope she's NOT dead and that she didn't make him unhappy by leaving him or anything. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;03 May 2011, 13:41</p><p>If one were a conspiracy theorist though (which I am not), you would notice that in the more recent years, the taking off of glasses in photos stops at the same time the wife disappears (divorced? dead?) from the pictures.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;03 May 2011, 13:23</p><p>He's definitely a hottie that keeps improving with age. I don't think the pictures without glasses are due to being self-conscious or his wife telling him to remove them.  I think that he has had enough experiences where the glasses glared and 'ruined the picture.' </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 May 2011, 08:44</p><p>I agree -- he's a cute sexy high myope, and only improving with age!  </p><p>You're right about the bare-eyed photos, James. I just usually assume bare-eyed photos of super-nearsighted people are in contacts because they're so blind bare-eyed, but in this case, he seemed to pose for photos with glasses off a lot. </p><p>I think at this point, the RX is so high that he just won't do it any more. Also, he may be at the point where he looks cross-eyed or otherwise not normal without glasses. One guy I met looked perfectly normal (and extremely hot) in his -12ish glasses, but when they were off his eyes were crossing and had a very blank look.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Obsessed</b>&nbsp;03 May 2011, 08:21</p><p>I mean, what could be better than a collection of several hundred photoes with serious and smiling faces, STRONG (!!) glasses and semi-blind squinting, dressed and topless, with all parts of the body including hands and feet properly demonstrated? :) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Obsessed</b>&nbsp;03 May 2011, 08:19</p><p>Totally agree with all the statements! I think the bare-eyed pictures are actually bare-eyed and not CL. And yes - his RX seems to be stronger and he seems to be getting much hotter in general as time goes by. I think he's in the mid teens now (RX-wise, of course ;-)). </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;03 May 2011, 05:34</p><p>Another example of glasses on and then off </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.declium.com/threeofus/images/1999/Steve+Connie-atRodeo.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.declium.com/threeofus/images/1999/Steve+Connie-atRodeo.jpg</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;03 May 2011, 05:31</p><p>This guy is a great find. He also seems to have "grown into" his looks and got hotter with age. </p><p> </p><p>I think some of the supposed contacts photos are just him taking his glasses off though. There are lots of examples where he has them on in one photo and not in the next, and the squintiness of the eyes somewhat backs up this theory. An example: </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.declium.com/threeofus/images/2001/June/SC-060801.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.declium.com/threeofus/images/2001/June/SC-060801.jpg</a> </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.declium.com/threeofus/images/2001/June/SC3-060801.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.declium.com/threeofus/images/2001/June/SC3-060801.jpg</a> </p><p> </p><p>(I'm not implying he NEVER wears contacts though in the older pics) </p><p> </p><p>Wonder if was self-conscious about the glasses or if the wife was telling him to take them off? Either way, he is certainly comfortable with them now, and that's a good thing, as he'd be blind without them (as he would've been then anyway!). </p><p> </p><p>Definitely agree that the Rx seems to have increased over the past ten years though. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2011, 14:47</p><p> </p><p>I cannot believe how many exciting new websites are now online for men in glasses, boys in glasses, etc. Tumblr websites are particularly good, and I see that others of you have posted links. As you probably know, in a Google search box, you can just input "tumblr" and "glasses" and "boys" OR "men"--and about a half dozen tumblr glasses websites come up.

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2011, 00:56</p><p>Nice sighting this morning. I went to a gym that I don't go to normally, one that is frequented by downtown business types. Plenty of very good looking men! Including one young accountant/auditor (his T-shirt with company logo gave it away), with a great body, brown hair, scruffy 5-o'clock shadow, and wearing dark-rim glasses around -6. Very nice.... I am pretty sure he is used to wearing contacts mostly, because it was early in the morning, and he kept adjusting his glasses like he wasn't comfortable with them. Even better, then he took them off and looked very close to see a speck on them. Ahh, such a turn-on. I could have kept checking him out for a long time, but I had to go. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2011, 21:24</p><p>Hi, Cactus Jack! Sorry about missing your first post in response to my friend's situation. I mustve clicked post and then typed while your post came onthe thread.  </p><p>Thanks for the advice about the rx estimations. I will probably just end up waiting for him to get the exam. Naturally, he'll tell me how it went, and then I'll probably ask him if he knows what the rx is. I'm still reluctant to wear my glasses. Part of this is because my glasses are a couple years old. I only use them around the house. I am going to get new glasses soon, hopefully. As for contacts, I'll probably wait since paying for glasses and contacts as well as an expensive school trip will be too much.   </p><p> </p><p>The thing about this situation with my friend is that he has never shown any signs of needing glasses at all. I have never seen him squint, and he has never mentioned it. However, I suppose that's not too out of the ordinary. He couldve just kept to himself until the right time, I suppose.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2011, 20:49</p><p>Chrissi, </p><p>You are right.  Your friend would probably just see blurry blobs with your glasses.  It is unlikely that he could function this long without correction with an Rx anywhere near -13. </p><p>My suggestion is that you first show him your glasses and explain that they are very strong.  You normally wear contact lenses, but keep the glasses around just in case something happens to the contacts.  Because you have difficulty in unfamiliar environments without contacts or glasses. </p><p>Depending on his reaction to that, you might offer to try on your glasses over your contacts so he can see what your glasses look like.  Explain that with double correction, you cannot see very well at all.  If, after that. he wants to try them on, alert him that even though he probably needs glasses, it is not likely that he will need glasses anywhere near this strong. What he will see is pretty close to what you see when you are wearing double correction. </p><p>His reaction to all this is a good way to judge his character and perhaps decide if he is a "keeper". </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2011, 20:00</p><p>Soundmanpt: we'll see how it goes. He mentioned a visit to the clinic his mother and brother go to, which is not the same place I get my contacts from. If he gets glasses though, I will certainly post about them! </p><p> </p><p>Original Tony: I don't think he'd be able to see anything with my glasses on! My prescription is  around -13.... </p><p>He actually wanted me to wear my glasses to school tomorrow instead of contacts. I am extremely averse to this idea due to the strength of my glasses and the fact that I have not worn glasses in public for the past four years!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2011, 19:58</p><p>Chrissi, </p><p>I am sure you have posted it, but I cannot recall your Rx.  If your friend is curious about what his Rx is before the exam, you might suggest the procedure I described on the Post Your Prescription thread in two related posts. </p><p>Post 1 at 30 Jan 2011 20:52 </p><p>Post 2 at 1 Feb 2011 05:39 </p><p>I suspect he is myopic, particularly if he does not have problems reading at typical distances, but he could have some astigmatism also.  If he does the test, please let us know the calculated results and then the actual exam results if possible. </p><p>The reason I asked about your Rx is that if there is a big difference between what he needs and your Rx his first reaction might be that they are not much better than no glasses. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2011, 13:55</p><p>Chrissi </p><p>I would say it is pretty certain that your guy friend will need glasses and I would say from what he described that he will be wearing them quite a bit within a short period of time. Maybe you should mention having him go with you when you go for your contacts. I assume you are meaning your yearly checkup that you have to have to get your next supply of lenses? When he goes be sure to come over to the "Post Your Prescription" thread with the details. Are you anticipating any changes in your contacts? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2011, 00:22</p><p>A good male friend of mine brought up his vision in a conversation I was havng with one of my female friends. I talked about how I need new contacts, and the girl mentioned needing new glasses. My guy friend contributed, saying that his mom asked him if he could read these words on the tv, and he couldn't even tell that they were there. His mother let him borrow her glasses (her glasses for distance, he said) and he said that he could tell that there were words onthe screen, but still couldn't read them. Personally, I was a little surprised at this news because I'd never noticed him having any vision issues. He is going to an optometrist soon, but I do not know when. I wonder if he'll have to get glasses.  </p><p>I told him that if he needs them, then he should get black plastic ones! Haha </p><p>He said that he almost wants his eyes to be bad because then he'll look smarter. I don't think that he has a fetish. He probably just wants them as an accessory. oh well.  </p><p>Well, anyway! I hope he gets them! I am almost a little bit excited... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2011, 23:04</p><p>It's hard to say if there are any particular behaviors with glasses that I enjoy, but I do sometimes see guys with that "day off from contacts" look -- it's hard to say how I can tell, but sometimes I just can. Yesterday there was a guy at the gym with that look. He was wearing a ski cap with the glasses, which were around -5, and he had a lot of tattoos. Somehow the look just didn't quite jive with the nerdy glasses, but of course they looked great on him. Sometimes guys (especially with lovely higher minus prescriptions) appear to be peering through their glasses and testing how far they can see. It's obvious they don't seem to be used to wearing them, and maybe they're getting used to the distortion and the small image size of their strong RX. Meanwhile I'm enjoying their "tiny eyes"! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2011, 13:00</p><p>Saw three of my favourite glasses related "behaviours" (I suppose that's what you would call them) today, all of them at various times on  the Tube (subway). </p><p> </p><p>1) high myope (at least -10, very inappropriately square wire rim frames, not in a hi-index material, I'd say clearly a day off from contacts, hipstery 30's-ish guy with long hair and a cap) lifted the glasses with thumb and index finger, eyes closed, squeezing bridge of nose for prolonged period. </p><p> </p><p>2) another high myope (I'd say at least a -8, quite large aviator inspired frames, not worn with any retro sensibility, he was just an older guy, probably late 40's), was reading while walking. And by reading, I mean he tilted his head at angle so as to look over the frames, holding the page literally about 2 inches from his face - this behaviour is not to be confused with pushing the glasses down one's nose to read with your head at a normal angle. That wouldn't have worked for a guy with this level of myopia, hence his convoluted head-tilting and holding of reading matter ridiculously close. Bifocals anyone? </p><p> </p><p>3) Yet a third high myope (it was really a day for sightings - when it rains it pours as they say - this almost guarantees the rest of the week will be serious myope free), I'd guess also about -10, this one with sensible high index lenses in a very small wire rim frame. He repeatedly pushed the glasses closer to his eyes to read the next station (displayed in a ticker tape style). Even when not pushing them closer (they were already very close, it wasn't a case of them sliding down or anything), the temples were at an upward tilting angle, indicating this guy definitely needed a bump in his Rx. </p><p> </p><p>Any of these things individually is a treat. Three on the same day is almost too many to properly digest and appreciate. There were many myopes today, some high as well, but these are the three that stayed with me. </p><p> </p><p>Does anyone else have anything in particular they enjoy seeing myopes (or indeed, hyperopes) do with their glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2011, 09:03</p><p>James, I couldn't agree more! Nothing is more exciting than when the high myopia "secret" is revealed! Wearing powerful glasses full time is hot, but wearing them only "at night" "because my prescription is so strong" is much more exciting to me. Especially if I'm the lucky one getting to enjoy the intimacy of being one of the only people who gets to see the guy in his usually hidden coke-bottles. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2011, 04:43</p><p>Tinyeyes - it is! Because it's a personal and major thing about the person that you have found out.....I find it almost more tantalising when the high myopes alternate between contacts and glasses. It makes the glasses sightings that much more special. And if they are a little uncomfortable in the glasses, so much the better!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2011, 01:12</p><p>Wonderful story, James.... how nice that you were able to verify the RX! Isn't it just like striking gold when you discover someone has been wearing strong contact lenses all along? Nice...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2011, 13:23</p><p>Great sighting at my new(ish) job today. </p><p> </p><p>One of my new colleagues, who shared my office for the day, showed up in glasses today. I'd never seen him in glasses the few times we'd met before, and in fact had no inkling, that sixth sense one sometimes has, triggered by the way someone blinks or even something undefinable, that he was a contact lens wearer. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, he is a scientist and what I would categorise as sexy nerd/geek....probably early thirties, maybe even late twenties, but with steely, completely grey hair, all thick and tousled and sexy, a completely ripped but effortless body that he is probably not even aware of. </p><p> </p><p>The glasses were semi-rimless, i.e. rim at the top, rimless at the bottom, where part of the edge thickness (unless I am wrong) is attributable to the frame itself, i.e. over and above the Rx itself, so the glasses looked quite substantial. I also noticed he peered at the screen, leaning in quite close. This may just be a myope trait generally, or indicative that a stronger Rx is needed. Either way - it was sexy. </p><p> </p><p>Shortly before he left (he doesn't live in London and was just in the London office for the day), he went to the bathroom, and when he returned to say goodbye, was in contacts. I am sure he had his reasons, but putting in the lenses at the end of the day strikes me as odd. Perhaps a sign he has never really got comfortable in glasses, never got over that first awkward phase, at whatever age, and if this is true, I can relate and do not judge him. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, seizing this perfect opportunity for investigation, I went to the bathroom and found his disposed of contact lens packets - one eye -5, the other -6.5. That is an Rx that I would scoff at on paper (give me the high myopes please, universe!), but it is not insubstantial in the non-OO world (certainly precludes you from part time wear), and with his particular frame, looked quite impressive. In any event, it was a lovely sight to behold all day.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2011, 01:11</p><p>Big glasses are making a comeback, most definitely, with the young/hipster crowd. I've seen a few guys with large frames and surprisingly strong prescriptions! As with everything in fashion, when the people are young enough that they don't remember something, it's new again and the cycle begins again. I thought those huge frames would never come back, but here they are! Also, boat shoes from the 80s, and coming soon, short shorts!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2011, 11:39</p><p>Was at Starbuck's yesterday.  Saw a guy there wearing aviator glasses, like those worn in the 70's.  He was probably in his mid 20s.  I was surprised to see a younger guy wearing the silver frames.  The glasses looked huge on him, but the minus prescription was not very strong.  He wasn't all that cute to look at, but his glasses did catch my attention.  Just wondering if these frames are making a comeback?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;16 Jan 2011, 12:25</p><p>No link to share here, but I had many good sightings in the last couple of days. First, a very good-looking, almost model-handsome guy, around 30, at the gym, with a great body, smooth skin, scruffy brown hair, baseball cap, and plastic-frame glasses around -6.00.  At a very straight gym and he looked straight. Then, at the home improvement store, a nerdy looking skinny white guy, mid-30s maybe, kind of a younger Jeff Goldblum look, with retro plastic frames and deep cut-in, around -8.00 to -10.00. Nice!  </p><p>Then, attended a gay party with a mostly Asian crowd....not a great-looking crowd, but many in glasses. There were at least half a dozen guys in glasses ranging from -6.00 to -10.00 I would guess. Including a Chinese couple who both wore strongish glasses -- one of them cleaned his glasses and then took his boyfriend's and cleaned his too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2010, 23:22</p><p>Yeah, the smoking guy and his glasses are hot (and probably not his real rx, or if it is he is clearly deliberately "playing to the OOs"). He seems to be making an appeal to the smoking fetish community too I'd say, though I'm not into that myself and don't know too much about it. Not that I mind it really, but the way he smokes without holding the cigarette makes me a wee bit nervous, what if it falls out of his mouth and sets the floor on fire?!  </p><p> </p><p>I ALWAYS make passes at guys who wear glasses (even if they're prolly GOC and have slightly scary smoking habits), Marie 8-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Obsessed</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2010, 13:22</p><p>That is so true!  </p><p> </p><p>I've known people who can see perfect through their -15 coke bottles and others who have problems focusing through -6 glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Contacts and intraocular lenses seem to do a much better job overall. Unfortunately, even with RX as low as -6 some people already prefer contacts because they give them better vision. </p><p> </p><p>Overall, my motto is: vision comes first. If someone can see clearly in their thick glasses, I love that. However, if they cannot do glasses, I will genuinely be happy for them because vision is irreplacible. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2010, 11:07</p><p>@ Obsessed - I hear what you're saying. What I meant was, I was unaware that there could be such divergent results with glasses and contacts (as the ICL is essentially an implanted contact lens) i.e. that you could be legally blind with one but 20/20 with the other. Thought differences were more slight (with contacts obviously giving better acuity at higher RX's). Live and learn, I guess.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Obsessed</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2010, 09:39</p><p>@James:  </p><p> </p><p>some people cannot be corrected close to 20/20 with glasses because of their phisiology.  </p><p> </p><p>if the intraocular lens is the person's only chance to see well, then it must be used.  </p><p> </p><p>I love thick glasses myself (that's why I'm here), but I don't think anyone should ever be denied good vision without them if they make such a decision. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tivosesante</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2010, 12:25</p><p>since people have been sharing sightings i would like to share this one which was a little over an hour ago at a flea market in florida. one which i frequent and often see at least one or two myopics per visit...this one i had spotted a couple of weeks ago and this time he was in the shade of one of the indoor sales areas where there was no glare and i was able to get up fairly close, say three feet ...i would say he is latino probably mexican, about 14 to 17 yrs. of age good looking and with coke bottle lenses tinted in lime or say coke bottle green.... at least 1/2 in. thick at the outer edges and myodisc....with black frames wide lenses very deep cut and powerful silverish power rings.....i would say he is no less than -24  d and very obviously his glasses are what you commonly find among teenagers in style as well as being high index, but being so thick and strong they come off much like -17d's in the old cr-39 ers.....definitely the best and strongest glasses i have seen in years, i hope to get to know him sometime soon and do some foto work....meanwhile i am assimulating something of an image to give eveyone an idea what it was like and i'll post in about an hour on my picassa web album which is open to the public.....</p><p></p><hr>

I have literally had my heart pounding and felt short of breath at sightings like that, when there was a combination of high or very high prescription and attractive guy....  Too bad you couldn't get a picture! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;24 Sep 2010, 15:26</p><p>AMAZING sighting today in the queue to get coffee. Tall (must have been at least 6"3), skinny, handsome guy with at least -14 (honestly, I am very conservative with my estimations, he could have been -17 for all I know - in any event, a CRAZY prescription)....wearing skinny pants, tight white shirt and one of those skinny ties that seem now to be in fashion. Lots of gel in his (thinning) hair, styled in a messed up "bedhead" style....so much gel in fact, it was the smell of it that made me turn around and see him looming over me. </p><p> </p><p>As seems to be de rigeur among the super-myope set these days, frames were wide plastic (but narrow top to bottom) rectangular frames,wide-ish temples, a pale blue in colour. Of course, confronted with this image, it literally takes my breath away, I felt almost winded.....obviously I tried to contrive many reasons to turn around and not seem like a TOTAL creep, but pretty sure I came off creepy (oh well! it was worth it). What made it harder to take a look was that he was looking dead ahead, i.e. at me every time I turned around. He clearly has a fast metabolism, as he got two sausage rolls and two doughnuts. I almost followed him down the street, but checked this possibility as beyond the realm of acceptable. </p><p> </p><p>Cut-in was otherworldly in how extreme it was....you could have seen the whole planet behind him through those lenses, power rings for days..... </p><p> </p><p>Sad thing (from a reality point of view) is, from his dress and demeanour, he could definitely have been gay (a RARITY for someone wearing thick glasses....maybe it was a day off from contacts?). I just go blank in these situations, my mind is an abyss, and the only sentence I could probably construct is I LOVE YOU, which of course is wholly unacceptable in polite society. </p><p> </p><p>I had a frog in my throat as I ordered my coffee.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;26 Aug 2010, 04:51</p><p>London actually has a glut of high minus sightings....never thought I would say this, but there are actually too many to process. At one point I actually wondered if I was hallucinating from lack of sunlight, but no, they appear to be real.  </p><p> </p><p>And when I say high minus, I mean at least double digits. </p><p> </p><p>I have been thinking about it, and I think the prevalence is attributable to two main things: </p><p> </p><p>1) London is a magnet for skilled labour from across Europe, Asia, Africa and even North America. A lot of this skilled labour are the geeky IT types; and </p><p> </p><p>2) While a stylish city, people here have far fewer pretences and/or need for artifice than, in my opinion, the US or other parts of Europe. From this it follows (my theory) that people are far less likely to wear contacts for reasons of pure vanity (i.e. if they don't present clear visual advantages, whether perceived or actual).</p><p></p><hr>

Now I am a complete sceptic who tends to scoff at posters here who nonchalantly report myodisc and various other high minus sightings. But this guy had to be at least -14 (if I am being conservative) and possibly even -16. This was a handsome, hipstery looking guy (longish wavy hair), but the eyes were like pin pricks behind the lenses. </p><p> </p><p>He had black plastic Armani frames, VERY narrow top to bottom and wide across the face. Had the thick arms in a way blended into the frames (i.e. not a sharp right angle) that obscured what could only be MONSTROUS edge thickness. </p><p> </p><p>The strangest part: he had two kids, a boy and a girl in that indeterminate 8-12 age range - the physical resembleance removed any doubt he was their father, and NEITHER was in glasses. This was interesting to me, as even if their mother has the eyes of a fighter pilot, surely this guy's heavy dispensation for extreme myopia should have dented their genes somehow? Perhaps it is just a matter of time.... </p><p> </p><p>Many many other sightings of substantial myopes (and interestingly, hyperopes too) too numerous to mention. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>fracl</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2010, 16:35</p><p>As to the lasik and other operations, next to making me very sad that someone has invented this, I must say that in Europe (at least the continental part) there seems to be no big rush for it. People know it exists, very few do it but there seems to be no hype. Out of all the people I know only 3 have undergone lasik of which one was forced as he wanted to become a ship captain at that time (he was a -3, and is very unsatisfied by his night vision, plus he wears -0,75 again permanently) </p><p> </p><p>What follows should be no offense to Americans it's just some thing I remark during the plenty of traveling I undertake: </p><p>I hope that with lasik it will be like with the automatic gear shift, big success in the US and in Europe a few think they need to have it but it is seen as boring and unmasculine by most that still like to have control over their gears (or the way they can change their look with glasses and contacts). </p><p> </p><p>I also tend to find most Europeans more fashion aware if it come to glasses then the US (leave NYC and SFR out of it) where I find most guys with standard wired framed black glasses, and I tend to find less of a "season" for glasses then I find in Europe where often you can see trends shift within a year or to from plastic to wire to rimless etc. </p><p> </p><p>Other remark that you can comment on: I tend to see a lot of glasses wearing guys in very rural areas where opticians are far away and fashion less important. Then I also find that in big cities there are quite some guys in glasses (often the air is polluted and dusty, and the metro is windy, not nice for contacts and there is usually a sense of fashion that allows you to sand ou of the crowd, hence you can wear you designer glasses). The worst I find is your average boring suburban area or mid-sized city, contacts seem to flourish there :-(</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2010, 12:05</p><p>In the supermarket the other day was quite a guy in his early twenties with dark rimless non-rx shades up on his hair. But in front of his eyes were fine, medium-strength plus lenses shining like crystals in their small silver wire frame. Now I don't often go for plussies, but this one caught my eye. I wondered how his vision was outside with the shades but no rx.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2010, 11:37</p><p>Jennifer </p><p>i like you have wondered over the past few years why health insurers don't cover more that 10%, if that much towards lasik surgery. It seems they consider it to be cosmetic which is rediculious by most standards. I can actually understand that contact lenses come under cosmetic, because they are only an option instead of wearing glasses. Lasik even though this site is dead set against it as we all want people to wear glasses as much as possible is a basic cure for many vision conditions these days for many people. It has become advanced now to the point of near perfection. I tell people all the time I do think it will happen that insurance companies will someday cover it in full. Sadly that will be bad for us guys that like looking at a beautiful lady wearing glasses full time. Currently cost is the main thing keeping many from getting the surgery done. </p><p>By the way, have you found glasses that don't slip down while your working in the ER?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2010, 10:19</p><p>Having worked in health care in America for a number of years, I've always asked myself why the vision care industry doesn't cover lasik, etc as a benefit.  If these procedures are a sure correction to vision, why not make it a covered benefit.  Instead most vision benefit cover an eye exam and glasses every two years.  When insurance companies start offering lasik as a covered benefit, is when the insurance companies are convinced of safety, cost saving, and permance of these procedures. </p><p> </p><p>For example, in California insurance is covering gastric bypass surgeries for morbid obesity.  The positive outcome of the surgery has convinced health care executive of the cost saving of these patients.  This surgery is very expensive and requires several days of inpatient care in a hospital. </p><p> </p><p>So when is lasik going to be widely accepted by insurance and covered as a benefit?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2010, 09:52</p><p>Just for the record, I was joking about the oversight committee. I am a militant libertarian in "real" life. It is your life and your eyes to do with what you will. </p><p> </p><p>What I was not joking about was that people (whether having LASIK/ICL/whatever refractive procedure) DO tend to conflate "curing" their myopia with "correcting" it.  </p><p> </p><p>Because these procedures remove the need for external implements (contacts/glasses), people either forget (or don't understand in the first place) that the pathology of high myopia is still present. In my experience, this is true of even otherwise intelligent and educated people.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2010, 09:00</p><p>The Visian Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) discussed in the videos is replaceable and therefore changeable.  Unlike the IOLs used in cataract surgery which replaces the natural crystaline lens, the Visian lens is placed between the Iris and the crystaline lens, like an internal contact lens and it can be removed.  The crystaline lens is not affected and it retains its ability to provide the focusing function for close vision.  I have not checked the available powers for the Visian lenses, but I suspect the reason the -22 patient required additional PRK is that the the Visian lenses do not go quite high enough in power to fully correct his vision. </p><p>Note that the patients are all older than the mid 20s.  I doubt any eye surgeon would consider ICLs for any patient whose vision was not stable.  Even if there were some changes, they would be small and if the -22 patient wound up needing + or - 1.00 glasses or CLs, that would be almost insignificant compared to -21.00 or -23.00 glasses.  I am sure the patients are well aware that the ICLs cannot alter the risks associated with very high myopia, but the risks would be there with either glasses, contacts, or ICLs. </p><p>To my knowledge, Visian lenses are not available in plus powers which would be of interest to those wishing to be more myopic.  However, the minus lenses might be ideal for those wishing to be hyperopic (Tino?) if you can find someone willing to implant them.   Because they do not become permanently attached to internal tissue in the eye, they can be removed if you change your mind, but it requires surgery. </p><p>For those wishing for more oversight.  Remember, the ICLs had to undergo years of testing before approval was granted in the first place.  But for increased assurance, perhaps this would be a good task for the Ministry of Vision.  If the MoV gave their approval, you KNOW proper procedures would be followed and all implants would be 100% successful.  If, by some billions to one chance, your procedure was not successful, you could complain to the Ministry of Complaints, just down the hall from the Ministry of Silly Walks, and they could put you on the list for your formal hearing to get on the list for having the problem fixed. </p><p>C. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2010, 07:59</p><p>Wonder why they wouldn't have the guy in RGP lenses not wear his glasses?  As a commercial to sell the procedure, it makes more sense to show how thick and strong looking his glasses are.  It would convince the viewer more.  Maybe it's just wishful thinking on my end.  I agree with the unregulated aspect of the these surgeries.  Does anyone have statitics to show how many end up back in glasses after a few years? All of us have heard of the bad outcomes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2010, 07:03</p><p>Well said, James. I think you might be right about the lack of oversight of this industry. I'll be right there beside you on the council, LOL!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2010, 01:20</p><p>I am enjoying these ICL testimonials a lot! I found two more I enjoyed: </p><p> </p><p>This guy was -15 (!!!) in his worse eye, and you can really picture him needing those coke bottles (something about big puppy eyes always signifies high myopia to me) </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvUqrsHh48c" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvUqrsHh48c</a> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>This guy you at least get to see in RGP lenses before his surgery (closest we're getting to "before" shots I think). Added bonus: you also see him getting helped blindly to the table....alas, no glasses in sight. </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8jiLloWi3E&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8jiLloWi3E&amp;feature;=related</a> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What worries me about this industry in general, though (in addition to the obvious, i.e. that they're helping people get rid of glasses!) is that they seem to be making otherwise intelligent people think that this is CURING their myopia, rather than just CORRECTING the error in much the same way (albeit more conveniently) as glasses or contacts. </p><p> </p><p>I think this explains the nonchalance of the -22 guy - he clearly believes his myopia is cured. Otherwise he would NOT be going skydiving at that Rx. Any responsible opthalmologist would tell him that, at that Rx (which he still has, just corrected), he is at ALARMING risk for retinal detachment, cracks, tears etc when doing things like skydiving, scuba diving etc. </p><p> </p><p>Also, the fact that they did PRK on a -22 (where they are actually SCRAPING at your cornea, or at least part of your eye) is completely outrageous to me. The industry definitely needs more oversight. I submit myself as head of the oversight council that will grant/deny high myopes applications for refractive surgery. I will be very strict.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 Aug 2010, 20:17</p><p>Nice job faking the pic of the -22 ICL guy.  It's surprising how nonchalant the guy in the video is about his surgery -- I mean, if he was -22.00, it's truly a miracle for him to get to 20/20 without glasses! It's hard to imagine him in -22.00 glasses (and can contacts even correct that high an error?) But I guess it's true.... it just seems strange that his testimonial is about the same as someone with a -5.00 talking about how they can swim without glasses now, etc. </p><p></p><hr>

Than he dissapeared into bathroom, came back to the bed and while sitting next to me, he pulled out his contacts. Absolutely Amazing. He told me that he is like -7. At that time I was still -5 and so it sounded strong to me. He did not put on his glasses and so I was sure, that his vision must have been blurry. Later he dissapeared again into bathroom and I was able to make out his glasses on the writing desk. Silver rectangular metal frames with nice and stong looking leses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2010, 01:24</p><p>A beautiful sighting yesterday afternoon. A guy 18-20 out with his family wearing silver semi-rimless - the type that's hinged at top squared corners, with rounder edges to the bottom of the lenses. The striking thing was his new and deliciously thick lenses glinting in the bright sunlight. A standard-index -5, I'd say, when so few do standard index now. I love the way new lenses appear so clean and bright.</p><p></p><hr>

They are much more likely to result in requests for removal from the content owner. To cut down on aggravation among Flickr and YouTube users, as well as bloggers, I ask that links come with some basic description. </p><p> </p><p>It's also a courtesy to users here, so we can decide if it's worth a click or not. </p><p> </p><p>Your flickr link is fine. But I still wouldn't have any idea what's behind your YouTube link unless I clicked on it. How about "French guy with rimless" or something? </p><p> </p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2010, 08:01</p><p>mattp, </p><p>You can get and idea of the approximate size of a glasses wearers field of vision by observing the appearance of the eye from the side.  This is because most optical systems actually work in both directions - looking out and looking in. </p><p>If you look closely at the glasses as the young man turns his head, his eye disappears from your view point very soon after he begins to turn his head away from the camera.  When you can no longer see his pupil, he cannot see objects at that angle (actually, a bit less) from his central axis of vision.  He likely has very poor peripheral vision.  Strong plus glasses tend to act like telescopes or telephoto lenses because of the vertex distance of the lenses from the cornea.  The enlarge and focus the image on the retina, but reduce the visual field. </p><p>Minus lenses can have an opposite effect.  If you look closely at a person wearing fairly strong minus glasses, you can see their eye at pretty close to 90 degrees from their central axis of vision.  They, of course, minify the image and act, to some extent. as wide angle lenses. </p><p>Very high plus or minus lenses tend to provide the best visual acuity when the central axis of vision coincides with the optical center of the lens.  This means that people who need lenticular plus lenses or myodisc minus lenses are pretty much forced to keep their eyes looking through the center of the lens and move their head rather than their eye to see things well that are off the optical center of the lens. </p><p>C. </p><p>P.S The two way characteristics of optical systems is why the examiner can determine your approximate Rx by looking in your eye with an opthalmoscope, retinoscope, or auto-refractor. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jonnie4eyes</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2010, 10:59</p><p>I mainly agree with you guys.  One other point: I'd have expected more cut-in and power rings for the thickness (compare with geektron's images). </p><p> </p><p>Whatever the deal, though, I've rather fallen for him. (And I found him first, Tinyeyes!) </p><p> </p><p>Maybe he's going through a 'Jey Ping Phase' - a high myope making the very most of it. JP seems to have moved on. Pity.

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2010, 23:57</p><p>I agree on all counts, EXCEPT someone with a high RX like that might be wearing RGP contacts, which usually cause a more "squinty" appearance rather than the more glassy-eyed look of a soft lens. But I still think it's a fake. Cute cute guy though!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2010, 23:06</p><p>Definitely a faker/GOCer - here are the signs: </p><p> </p><p>1. NOBODY who genuinely has a double digits prescriptios DOESN'T try to get the thinnest glasses possible; </p><p> </p><p>2. 95% of the photos on the flickr are about the glasses, and make explicit reference to the glasses, indicating a fetishist; </p><p> </p><p>3. Even high myopes don;t have their prescriptions "double" in "a few years". And in the rare instance that it did, you would surely be AWARE of this from your escalating contacts prescription....? </p><p> </p><p>4. The photo where he is supposedly wearing contacts reveals that he does not have the tell-tale big, doe-eyes of double digit myopes. </p><p> </p><p>Wish it was real though....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2010, 04:27</p><p>Guest, </p><p>The picture is not very good, but it appears that there may be a significant amount of Base Out prism involved.  The inner edge is hard to discern, but it appears to be very thin compared to the outer edge of the lenses and there is a pronounced prismatic shape to the lenses.  Could be in the vicinity of 15/15 BO, but you really can't tell much about the overall Rx and nothing about his orientation. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2009, 12:44</p><p>Yes, he was fantastic, but somehow the blond guy with sixties horn-rims was even better! Maybe because his look and style suggested that he normally or at least sometimes wears contacts, which is something I like. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2009, 14:47</p><p>Kevin &amp; guest. </p><p>I think that most myopic men over 35 have become so used to wearing their glasses that they are simply part of their wardrobe.  By then, they are probably well beyond any vanity considerations and prefer the good vision provided by the glasses.  Vanity may occasionally raise it head when presbyopia gets them and they have to consider bifocals or progressives. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kevin</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2009, 14:25</p><p>Maybe it's just a stereotype on my part but most men over 35 if they're myopic tend to wear there glasses all the time no matter how strong they are.</p><p></p><hr>

Johnny Knoxville was wearing glasses a lot. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFDDxubHvA." target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFDDxubHvA.</a>  At around 57 seconds he is shown.

<p><b>Kevin</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2009, 15:42</p><p>I saw Ricky too. I think he is only around -2 so I think it might be a personal choice to wear glasses. Though you don't see many men his age that wear glasses for short sight only sometimes, its usally all the time no matter what the strength is.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopic Grant</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2009, 08:02</p><p>Yeah, I think around -6 on those glasses.  He's cute even though he's definitely got the whole Jeffrey Dahmer 1980's glasses going on.  I'm sure he has different frames now with that being 10 years ago.  I'm surprised someone like him who would endure that kind of jarring wouldn't opt for contacts...glad he doesn't though.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ObsessedWithSpecs</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2009, 21:22</p><p>Another recent sighting... </p><p> </p><p>We were on the road in Long Island going to the North Fork. Got stuck in traffic at some point. As we stood there in the jam, a car pulled over next to us. There were two people in the cae - a driver and a passenger. They were discussing something actively. The driver was a gorgeos middle-aged American with a classical goatee and an amazing arms and hands. He turned his head in our direction once and stared at me for a second, but the look in his eyes was very empty for some reason. After a minute or two a couple of cars in front of us moved a foot or two forward, so the hot driver of that car was stopped from talking by his passenger and asked to go forward, as well. Can you imagine how delighted I was when I saw that he took a pair of ridiculously strong negative glasses off his lap and put them on his face? His RX was probably in mid double digits. Definitely over -12. Amazing... I was happy like a puppy :) The guy looked at the road and squinted a few times (probably checking if the focus was right ;)). Very nice thing to see in the middle of a difficult day. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ObsessedWithSpecs</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2009, 19:34</p><p>I had a very cool sighting today. I was taking a little walk in New York with a friend of mine. I kind of felt hungry-ish and asked my friend if we could go somewhere and have a bite to eat. </p><p> </p><p>When we entered the cute little Indian restaurant on the corner of the street and ordered our meals, a man walked into the restaurant with a woman (probably his wife) and sat down at the table next to ours.  </p><p> </p><p>He was probably half-Latin-American, in his mid 40's. Not slim, but not terribly overweighed. Very good looking. And on the tip of his nose he had a pair of fairly strong plus glasses (Rx +5..6). They added so much to his looks! I was even slightly disappointed that they were all the way down on the tip of his nose - clearly a pair of reading glasses (quite strongish though). He was going through the menu... </p><p> </p><p>My friend distracted me for a while, and I got back to looking at that man after about 10 minutes. By that time we had all gotten our meals and were enjoy eating. The man's glasses were still down on the tip of his nose. Suddenly something really noisy went by on the street.  </p><p> </p><p>(suprise) </p><p> </p><p>The man lifted his head, looked up, realized that he was totally helpless --- and slid his glasses all the way up to the bridge of his nose in order to make out what was going on out on the street.  </p><p> </p><p>I was delighted completely. One of those moments when one feels there IS heaven on Earth!</p><p></p><hr>

The cut in does not appear to me to be optically correct.  You can see the temples in the cut in, his hair line and the colored back drop, but no obvious ears for the temples to be resting on.  If you enlarge the image there still are no ears.  He may be myopic, but not as myopic as it appears. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thorfinn</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2009, 05:34</p><p>I would have to guess that Mr. Helms's glasses are more in the range of -6 to -8, just because mine are -7.5, and I have noticed about the same minification looking straight on, that is -- the amount of inset of one's face/head as it is reduced through the outer edge of the lens. At any rate, nice to see a star unabashedly wearing some powerful glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2009, 23:03</p><p>James-- thanks, those are great photos of Ed Helms that I hadn't seen! He is indeed a hottie in his glasses. Amazing cut-in on some of those photos!  He must hate wearing contacts, because he is seen in glasses quite a lot. I think he wears hard contacts, by the way. I agree that the RX is very close to -9 or -10. Yummy! It's especially amazing to see a famous actor wearing glasses so powerful in public. Now if only Jake Gyllenhaal would wear his!</p><p></p><hr>

The pics are mixture of new ones and 2003 shots, but they weren't available before - without paying to join, that is. These are the first 'new' shots of Dylan in glasses for five years, though he was squinting in some more recent ones, so I guess he hasn't gone for contacts, let alone lasik.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 May 2009, 00:46</p><p>Let's hope not.

However, the singer admitted that unfortunately, a new fashion accessory is not in question, and that he needs the glasses for his poor eyesight. </p><p> </p><p>Whilst on the late night show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Justin said to Jimmy Thats just ridiculous... I can see you, but I cant see any of you (audience). </p><p> </p><p>Timberlake is short sighted, and does not have a problem with having to wear glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Ive embraced it (bad eyesight).

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2009, 09:23</p><p>Tinyeyes, you did catch the only episode of American Idol where Darling Danny wasn't bespectacled. When I saw it I thought how much more fun that would have been back in pre-contacts days when you'd know he was bare-eyed and blurry, instead of wondering and thinking he's probably in CL's. But I think maybe he just enjoys being bare-eyed sometimes, because in some of the off-stage things I've noticed he will be wearing glasses at one moment, off the next and back again. I do strongly suspect he is One Of Us and I've considered sending him a bit of fanmail to inform him of our whereabouts, but I'm not sure, I understand some people are a little freaked out by us, at least at first 8-/. Anyway, I'd say -5 is a pretty accurate-sounding rx guess, I don't think -4 or less, I'm -4 and they do look a bit stronger than my glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;17 Apr 2009, 00:43</p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>On the contrary, Danny Gokey is a total OO glasses fetishist who seems to favour glasses over contacts.

<p><b>marsh</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2009, 15:03</p><p>hey, TINY EYES how about joining this conversation,  ciao</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>marsh</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2009, 14:48</p><p>Hi VFL, interesting, I have the same problem.  I never told countless others what the few told me.  Who knows what the future would have held in store? I think they were all good people and no mistakes. VFL, you still did not give me your RX and age?   I'll give you one more story- (I was invited to the home of someone i was doing business with in pa. when i got to his house his w was a -15 and a good cook,(I was -11 then) I of course said nothing about our coke bottles and had a good prime rib dinner.  Years later, he told me he got divorced and remarried an old gf from wva.  Several month after, he knew i was in ohio temporarily and after going away for weekend, i found a note that his ex was at friend for weekend in ncanton and looked me up to call her there.  I got back tuesday, called her friend and she said, "where was i, __ came all the way here just to see me.  I never called back, embarrased.) Later,VFL, come back with those answers! have you been to lenschat? ciao</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2009, 06:43</p><p>So it seems that all of these women had very substantial prescriptions of their own.  Interesting. </p><p> </p><p>I'm not a shrink.  I've spent years trying to figure out why I love men in glasses so, though.  Maybe that counts?   </p><p> </p><p>It is not only the glasses that attracts me.  The man has to be attractive to me anyway.  But the glasses have to be there to complete the attraction.  So I would say that what is going on wit;h me is a fetish, though not in the purest sense of the word.  That said, I have been very vulnerable emotionally because of this.  There are several times in my life when the man behind the glasses was not worthy of the affection I bestowed upon him.  I got it all mixed up in my mind because the attraction to the glasses was so strong.  This  derailed my younger, single life in more ways than one.   </p><p> </p><p>I never came right out and told a man that his glasses turned me on.  One did say that he thought that they did.  I didn't answer. Wonder what would have happened if I had.  I'm afraid it may have diffused the magic.  </p><p> </p><p>That's all for now. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>marsh</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2009, 14:49</p><p>VFL, you're something else. I felt all you said, it was long ago. one(a-13) stated the thick glasses attracted her, she didnt know why, but then she liked what was behind them, I believed her,  another (-7)after pushing on sofa said she was attracted to the glasses - but didnt want me wearing them inside, she didnt either in her house??  There are more but not now.  I was suprised, embarrased and relieved because i was self conscious too.  The relationships did not last, -7 was too princess and spender$ (she married rich canadian)and -13 went back to school, with her kids, to be a psych.  Yes its different? Yes it was "tingling" not to be worried about whether or not date liked the coke bottles (I hated c. lenses) I was self consious as youger person, now i dont care. Are you a psych? or similar or what? Whats your RX? tell me about your situations - in detail  ciao  marsh</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2009, 14:08</p><p>Really, Marsh?  Tell me what those girlfriends said to you when they admitted that they liked your glasses?  How did that make you feel?  Did you believe them?  Were you surprised?  Embarrassed?  A bit shy?  Were you more aware of your glasses after they "declared" themselves?  If so, in what way? </p><p> </p><p>I wear glasses myself...contacts more often so I "know" what it is like to need correction.  There's nothing very romantic to it in reality, but the idea of it in a partner is something quite different.  Wonder why that is.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>marsh</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2009, 09:47</p><p>b4 I saw this site, it was unusual for anyone to admit this but a few gf's did, I subconsciously felt everyone was looking at me, in younger days, at -11 with coke bottles. I am now at 60, cataract implants for the -11, with -4 left over in glasses, with the new interest and openness, I'd wear the -15's !!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2009, 08:00</p><p>Yes, it is the "almost never takes them off" part that is so endearing.  Even when they come off for just a moment or two, it can be such an emotionally charged moment.  Once a man I was absolutely crazy about was sitting next to me, in the middle of a conversation he took them off to polish them and looked me in the eye (how much he could see was debatable because of the thickness of those lenses) in such an intense way that I nearly had a heart attack.  I will go to my grave believing that he knew exactly what he was doing to me.  If he had taken off his clothes it wouldn't have sent more of a message in my mind.  A few moments later, he turned back to the task at hand and in the act of replacing the glasses, the spell was broken and normalcy returned.  It has been years and I still remember.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kevin</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2009, 02:03</p><p>Does anyone know if there's a gay dating site for guys in glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2009, 21:17</p><p>I dated one guy who was about a -9, and when he slept together, he would put on his glasses if we woke up at night, even in the darkness. I guess he could see a little in the darkness and he wanted to be able to see it clearly. He also put on glasses to use the bathroom etc. during the night, even if not turning on the light.  </p><p> </p><p>On another subject, I had a good sighting today at the gym -- haven't had that many lately!  Very tall white guy, late 30s or early 40s, light complexion with brown wavy hair, and (of course) extremely strong minus lenses. The frames were metal and were very small to keep the lens thickness down, but they were still thick with deep cut-in. I think he was around -12 or so. I see that even though larger frames are in vogue these days, the really high myopes are still wearing small styles, out of necessity. I find that very sexy of course.  Tiny glasses work very well for tiny eyes!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eustace</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2009, 20:19</p><p> </p><p>VFL:  I'm with you!  I particularly responded to your "almost never takes them off."  I have fantasies about guys who almost never take them off--even to shave, shower, swim, make love, or have sex. Nothing is more exciting that the guy who does not take his glasses off until he is in bed and has turned out the lights, who puts them on if he must go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, and who gropes for them first thing in the morning before he gets out of bed.  The thicker the better. And bifocals, trifocals, and prisms are even more of a turn-on. I love that image of helplessness. I even have some fantasies about guys who are so insecure without their glasses that they sleep with them on!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eric</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2009, 02:59</p><p>Kevin, I would say nearly all men in Singapore are nearsighted.  Many are wearing contacts, but still the vast majority in glasses.  Even with those middle-aged and older, rarely to do you see a pair of regular reading glasses---most are nearsighted with an add for close-up work.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2009, 13:50</p><p>Without fail, a handsome man who wears glasses and tickles my fancy, can drive me absolutely crazy by removing those glasses to either polish them or rub his eyes.  Extra points if he almost never takes the darned things off.  There is a strange intimacy in that act. </p><p> </p><p>Am I the only one to feel that way?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kevin</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2009, 11:27</p><p>Eric that story is amazing. Is it like that everywhere in Singapore? </p><p> </p><p>By over here I mean America, have you noticed more young children are wearing glasses. Where I work when I notice a kid with glasses, there is normally a myopic parent if not both and strong RX.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2009, 06:51</p><p>Kevin, </p><p>I'm not sure where "over here" is, but I have seen evidence of connecting glasses with intelligence or education occuring in the US. </p><p>Some years ago, I noticed a small group of 3 or 4 teen males in a local supermarket, all wearing glasses. At one point, I got close enough to overhear their conversation and notice that none of the glasses had any prescription, in fact the lenses still had the tiny designer logos that you find on glasses on display in optical shops. Their conversation was in English and it was obviously their mother language, but it was also obvious they hadn't paid much attention to proper usage in class. </p><p>Apparently, these young dim bulbs felt that wearing the non-Rx glasses would make them appear smarter, improve their grades (?), or perhaps make them appear more attractive to potential mates. There is an old saying that if the girls were attracted to boys that walked around on their hands, many hands would have calluses. </p><p>I later wondered, but not for long, how they got their glasses. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eric</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2009, 05:31</p><p>I am an accountant in Singapore.  We used to have only one guy in our office who did not wear glasses for nearsightedness.  After working here about a year, one day he comes in wearing glasses---strength looked very weak, but I think he did not want to be out-of-sync. Now he wears glasses all the time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kevin</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2009, 03:06</p><p>Do you think that trend will follow over here? My dad is -5, now I'm a -8, I have 3 brothers and they're all myopic, although I have the strongest glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2009, 19:22</p><p>Kevin, </p><p>Unless there is a genetic technique developed to cure myopia, I suspect that it will only take a few more generations for almost all to be myopic.  There will likely be a very few who aren't, but most will be.  That population is very prone to myopia and the ones who study, become prosperous, and have children, who study, become more prosperous, etc. will likely overwhelm the rest.  People in Singapore are pretty intelligent to start with and I suspect that high myopia is associated with scholarship in the society.  Those few who aren't myopic will probably try to induce myopia, do GOC, or have some form of surgical "correction" so they will not appear less scholarly than the rest of the population because of group pressure. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kevin</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2009, 18:20</p><p>I just read that 90% of students in Singapore are myopic, now I'm just wondering how long do you think it will be until the entire population are myopic. My guess is around 2080, what does everyone else think.</p><p></p><hr>

The temples of his newer glasses don't really fit properly over his ears - this is weird (and also titilating) as he clearly wears them ALL day EVERY day and yet somehow this issue never came up </p><p> </p><p>2. The glasses also aren't wide enough for his (lovely) face - this is highlighted in all the frontal photos. </p><p> </p><p>3. He just keeps his eyes closed even when the TV make-up person takes a break from applying his make-up, realising there is little point in opening them while not wearing his coke-bottles. </p><p> </p><p>4. The way his face gets fatter during the course of his campaign, especially in the chin area (glasses + chubby face/jowls = HOT!) </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;02 Feb 2009, 02:26</p><p>So I've been scouring the internet for the last few days poring over every photo of Thorsten Schaefer-Guembel ever taken.

<p><b>Cut-in UK</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2009, 14:18</p><p>It is very reassuring, but not entirely surprising, to find passionate women (VFL, Katy and Jennifer) moved by thought and the appearance of males in glasses. VFL we know well as a transparently passionate person. She writes as she speaks, and she is driven by feelings. Music, poetry (and myopic women) do it for me. They are triggers to the extreme emotions which many, but not all, possess. With passions, come mood swings, and cycles of elation and depression. It make life, and the persons involved, all the more interesting. I imagine that the poetry of Wordsworth or the music of Beethoven would not exist if they were not people of passion. Be bold and true to yourselves ladies, and continue to enrich the lives of those around you!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2009, 09:26</p><p>For me, Mits has just demonstrated what VFL was talking about, that glasses can change our perception of a man (which isn't always good). Before, I thought Mits sounded narrow minded and judgemental. Now he has put his prescription on the end of his post I think 'Ooh, he sounds nice!'. Hmmm. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2009, 09:06</p><p>Restraint is the difficult bit. But you are right Jennifer: a non-OO is easily spooked. As you say, every OO needs another! I wish I'd married one. If I had known what I know now I wouldn't have settled for any less. But when I was younger I just thought I was a bit "odd" being attracted by glasses! I've never mentioned it to my wife: she'd call me all sorts of names if she knew.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2009, 08:59</p><p>Mits, I think most of us have learned a great deal of restraint when it comes to our attraction to a man in glasses.  The last thing we want to do is scare the guy away because he thinks we are more interested in his glasses.  To this day, I am very guarded about the strong attraction.  I have strong thoughts about the guy, but am very careful to never come across inappropriate.  Although, I have to stop myself from starring at a handsome guy with glasses, many times.  Maybe this is the forum where we can express our true feelings about that good looking guy with glasses who crosses our path.  I do often wonder what it would be like if two OO's ended up together?  Wild sex!  Wow</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mits</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2009, 07:48</p><p>VFL, </p><p>I didn't intend to be mean to you. I do appreciate your affinity for men in glasses.

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2009, 00:34</p><p>Dearest Charles,  I only wonder when I were a single girl years ago what would have happened to me if the internet had been so popular. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2009, 10:07</p><p>Jennifer, Katy and VFL, it's a great thing for us migs that there are girls around like you. Especially when you are gwgs yourselves. </p><p>I wonder how many mig/gwg couples there are where both are OOs? I observe quite a lot of couples where both partners wear specs. But what I read here indicate that in many partnerships one is a reluctant gwg/mig non-OO and at best tolerates the optical interests of the other. </p><p>Is there any OO here who has an OO partner?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Charles</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2009, 09:38</p><p>VFL </p><p> </p><p>As far as I know, I am one of the most myopic men to come here. If only I could have met you years ago!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2009, 09:26</p><p>Katy and VFL, it's comforting to find there are other girls out there similar to me.  Through the years, I have done some crazy things to get close to a man in glasses.  I have to say that glasses wasn't the only thing that got me going.  There had to more to it than that.  I remember one incident in my younger days, when I was seeing a very handsome, MIG.  Went to meet him at work and saw him without his glasses.  I knew that he needed his glasses badly.  Turns out he broke his glasses in a fist fight.  It was his only pair and was struggling to get through the days until he got a new pair made.  What turned me on the most was that he really needed those glasses!  He complained of headaches and it just made me melt.  I wanted to comfort him and pamper him.  I knew how nearsighted he was.  Oh, he was so cute with or without his glasses! OMG! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest555</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2009, 09:19</p><p>Sorry guys, but this dissertion about whether glasses on a guy leads to explore the dark sides of soul's getting kinda out of place... VFL, I'm sure you're such a fine lady and to be treu and honest, if I was str8 I'd love to be with a girl like you, who besides my thick glasses likes my spirit, anyway... I wanted to tell that just the other day I went to this gay bar and I saw something you don't get to see every day, a guy about 40-something, fair skin, average built, cropped hair, both ears pierced, wearing black leather boots, pants and jacket, and bearing some of the thickest eyeglasses I've seen. They were light-grey tinted myodisks with quite a plus carrier and fitted in an oval shaped plastic black frame...  at first I thought of them as plusses with a reading add, but after a closer look and examination I realised they were myo's... not the biconcave type, but the single one... When he arrived I noticed most guys just took a look at him and got off right away... In my case, I'm not a big fan of skinhead leather guys, although I guess the leather bit was OK on hi, he had a decent looking body, but if it wasn't for the glasses I wouldn't have given him a second glance! When I went to the john I saw him closer and I saw both his eyes very extremely tiny behind them, almost impossible to see since the reflections were very extensive. I noodded at him, he nooded back and went off... since I was with a friend, I coudn't tarce him...I'm hoping I can go there once more and maybe get to see him again, so I can get a chance to chat with him... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2009, 08:08</p><p>VFL, lol, I don't think Mits sounds like he would like to be smacked, but that's a whole other story... </p><p> </p><p>Looking back, I can't believe some of the things I have done because of men with glasses. I know exactly how you feel, all reason goes out the window. It's as though it has more control of me than I do of it. But I don't think I have much choice about it, it's always there, whether I want it or not. And you're right that's it's a mixed blessing - it makes life more complicated, but a lot more interesting... :-) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2009, 18:39</p><p>Thank you for coming to my defense Katy.  Mits is mean and should be smacked.   </p><p> </p><p>It is all about thinking not acting.  Aren't most of our glasses thoughts fantasies anyway?  Mine are.  Sometimes they overwhelm me.  I'm a very sensitve person.  Men I fancy who need glasses to see clearly make me come undone.  It is my Achilles heel so to speak.  I look into those corrected eyes and lose control of all reason. It has gotten me into trouble in more than one occasion.  I give too much emotionally because of it.  That is a very bad thing because sometimes the man behind the lenses is not worthy.   </p><p> </p><p>Definitely not worthy.  But the glasses (and the power rings) draw me in.  What can I do?   </p><p> </p><p>If you can only say something snotty, don't bother to comment.  Remember, I am a real person and a real woman and not a fake.  This is as raw and as real as it gets.  I am putting it out there for all of you like minded people to see.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2009, 14:14</p><p>Well said, Pete! </p><p> </p><p>As far as glasses being considered sex toys, they do a lot more for me than anything else.

<p><b>Mits</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2009, 12:07</p><p>VFL, </p><p>What are we supposed to say? You seem to equate glasses and hopping into the sack with a guy.

<p><b>Martyn</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2008, 16:17</p><p>HI Emily gosh i,m shocked at the rapid increase of your RX over a couple of years, your RX has almost doubled, going on at theis rate you will need myodisc glasses, how would feel weaing those glasses. Hope your doing well at Uni long time since had sent you a little message. take good care Martyn </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Martyn</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2008, 16:13</p><p>HI Tinyeyes, i have a friend who is a professional photographer, he always likes glasses wearers to take their glasses off especially if they have a high minus RX, </p><p> </p><p>10 the lenses can act like mirrors and distort the picture. 2) the eyes are an important part of having a good pic taken. </p><p> </p><p>Wearing high minus RX glasses  the glasses are noticed more than the person behind them. </p><p> </p><p>I agree take your specs off to have your pic taken.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2008, 16:09</p><p>Tinyeyes -- Over -2 each diopter correlates to about 20/n, so -8 would be about 20/800.  I'm -14.50 and my optometrist says I'm about 20/1,400.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2008, 13:49</p><p>Yeah, people tend to have most of their pics taken without glasses unless they wear them all the time (sometimes even then!)  Does anyone know the RX for 20/800? I'm guessing around -8 or so, but I know it doesn't exactly correlate. </p><p></p><hr>

But this isn't for vanitys sake. My vision is horrible (somewhere around 20/800) and the lack of peripheral with the glasses drives me crazy. Plus to not have the glasses be thicker than coke bottles and extremely heavy on my nose, I have to get the smallest frames available. Which severly limits my range of vision to what is directly in front of my eyes. Then I can't just move my eyes to look at something I have to turn my whole head. However, if it weren't for the limited vision I would probably choose the glasses because the upkeep on the contacts can be a pain sometimes. And I definately agree that some guys look really hot with the right pair of glasses." </p><p> </p><p>Too bad we don't get to see him in his glasses, because they sound like high-minus wonders!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2008, 00:00</p><p>Thanks, 6.0. You look great! I would love to see you in your high-index lenses, too. This reminds me of a few years ago when my then-roommate had a friend visiting who I discovered wore hard contacts and VERY thick, large outdated coke-bottles not unlike the ones you're wearing in the videos. His RX was around -9 (very close to mine). At the time I had a pair of high index glasses with very small wire frames that were quite thin. I tried on his glasses (when he wasn't around) and realized our prescription was almost exactly the same. I was amazed that I could have such thin lenses, yet still see clearly through his thick glasses! They must have been about 3/8" of an inch thick. Although quite a bit older than me, he was very attractive -- tall and muscular. I only saw him wearing the glasses early in the morning a couple of times during his visit. I still wonder what he would have thought if he'd tried MY high-indexers on.  He never knew anything about my fetish or my attraction to him.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2008, 04:20</p><p> </p><p>I appreciated Kendyl's honesty regarding the Matt postings.  I agree that it might be a good idea to have a separate thread for those of us who would like to share our fantasies (and get reactions from others) but who are not quite ready to complete (or send to one of the fiction websites) a finished story.  I have lived in a fantasy world since childhood--many (but not all) of them sexual.  I too have many ideas for stories but just don't seem to have the time (or maybe the self-confidence) to sit down and write a more complete story.  Or, I keep changing things around in them.  It would be nice to be able to float an idea for a fantasy and solicit reactions--sort of a writers workshop approach, I guess.  I WONDER IF WURM WOULD CONSIDER A SEPARATE THREAD FOR SUCH?  It might be simply called "Fantasies" or "Stories in Progress."  I can understand that many posters in Eyescene have serious questions and problems that they wish to share and to get advice on--or even just true experiences and sightings that they would like to share.   They should not have to sift though our fantasies. </p><p> </p><p>Of course, I would prefer separate threads for gay fantasies and straight fantasies--but I suppose us "Fantasy Psters" could begin our posts with some kind of label--Gay Men, Gay Women, Straight Men, Straight Women, etc. </p><p> </p><p>What do some of the rest of you think?  Also, it would be great, if someone would send a post giving the contact information (e-mails, etc.) for getting stories "published" in one of the fiction websites--all in one directory.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kendyl</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2008, 22:22</p><p>For those of you interested in the "Matt" postings, please refer to my posting in XXX Links ONLY if you are not offending by honesty!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2008, 14:36</p><p> </p><p>Very interesting exchanges about Matt's postings!  I was not duped by this one.  I have been fooled in the past.  For example, Mark who claimed to be extremely myopic (with trifocals, as I recall), hearing aids, paralyzed from the waist down, a wheelchair racer, and with an entire family with vision and hearing disabilities (and even a brother who was a double amputee)!  And then there were the teenage twins who had rapidly-worsening vision and hearing.  Actually Matt's story was rather exciting, if just a bit too pathetic.  (One of the most unconvincing lines was the one about his not having an old, back-up pair of glasses--because his mother insisted in giving all of his old glasses to charity!)  Actually,  Matt could work this into quite an erotic story for one of the gay glasses fetish websites: Those mean locker room boys could strip all of his clothes off and throw him into the shower (with his glasses on, of course).  He could then bargain with the gang that, if they would promise not to touch his glasses, they could "have their way with him."  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2008, 22:23</p><p>Regarding the fake stuff, I guess I'm pretty naive. I really thought the Matt story was real. I guess because I was bullied as a child, I was more susceptible (although it wasn't because of glasses per se).  To me, the internet seems like a place where there is no reason to lie, because it's all relatively anonymous, so it strikes me as odd when people do it. I guess some people get a kick or a turn-on of some kind out of making up a story and getting reactions. I would think they wouldn't waste their time on online pranks -- wouldn't it be more fun to play a joke on someone in person, so you can see their reaction??  Oh well, go figure.  </p><p> </p><p>Wurm, thanks for running the site and taking care of all this! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2008, 16:54</p><p>Well Kendyl, there are places for posting glasses-related fiction. There are Yahoo groups called 'glassesfetishfiction' (the founder of which has resigned and left me i charge!) and'gayglassesfetishfiction'. I have seen another site too, which I found much more sexually explicit and less congenial. And then of course there's Bobby's wonderful archive at <a href="http://bobbygoc.sweb.cz/" target="_blank">http://bobbygoc.sweb.cz</a> - I suggest that's the place for writing fantasies, though I must admit I used EyeScene in this way in the early days - and I wasn't alone in this either.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kendyl</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2008, 13:30</p><p>Is it against the websites policy to post fictional stories to fulfill fantasies? I thought this was what the website was about, for OO's to come together and be able to share their stories/fantasies/etc and maybe some are true and some are not true but where else are we going to post our fantasy stories about glasses? Maybe I was wrong about the purpose of this website but as I posted, I have been coming here for years and years and generally post under a different name because I usually go awhile without posting.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2008, 13:06</p><p>I might add that the usual internet caveat applies -- don't start exchanging personal info with someone you aren't certain about.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2008, 13:03</p><p>No worries all. I have the distinct advantage of visitor log data to review. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe someday I'll post my list of dead giveaways, but I think Julian's approach has a lot to recommend it (take posts at face value unless something really jumps out at you). No sense in everyone getting all paranoid - that's my job!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2008, 20:29</p><p>I was out of town this weekend and I met a guy at the gym who wears -13 glasses...we talked and ended up hanging out for a bit, but it was kind of an awkward encounter. He was 25, from Taiwan and has only been in the U.S. for 2 years. When I told him I liked his glasses, he was very surprised and told me how he hates, hates, hates wearing glasses (Which is understandable) It makes it weird and awkward when someone is saying they find the glasses a turn-on, since it's a very negative thing to him. I've found this before with guys, but it was especially so with this guy. He told me didn't get glasses until he was 10 years old, and was a -4 at that point. He tried some kind of Chinese medicine thing to correct his vision without glasses, but it didn't work and within a couple of years he was -9! I think it was a very traumatic experience for him. By the time he finished high school, he was up to -12. He said he's tried contacts (hard RGP) but finds them very uncomfortable. He's hoping to try for Lasik (probably impossible for him) or ICL or PRK. I wanted to discourage him, but I understand how he feels. Guys with OO fetish are few and far between, and in the gay world it can be tough for someone who must wear -13 glasses all the time!  </p><p> </p><p>As far as how we met, I saw him as we were both coming into the gym together at the same time, and did a double-take when I was how strong his specs were. I said hi, not even sure if he was gay. As I worked out, I couldn't keep from looking at him because his glasses were quite unusual with lots of cutin and distortion (of course).  Finally, he came up to me and started talking!  Very nice guy, but a bit of a language barrier and also just beginning to come out. All in all it was an interesting experience!</p><p></p><hr>

I'm still digesting all this.... especially the two Asian guys... gosh, Asia and Asians are such paradise for high myopia OOs!   </p><p>James, I agree with you about the Singapore politician... he's quite striking with those small frames. It's hard to guess but I would he's closer to -15 than -10. Maybe some of our Asian readers can enlighten us, but I think double-digit myopia is quite ordinary in places like Singapore. I think these days, really small frames have fallen out of style somewhat, but they continue to be used for people with really strong RXs to keep thickness down. It also helps hide how small the eyes look in relation to the glasses frames. It's definitely hot!  Good find.... I also LOVE the guy who posted his RX slip. </p><p>As for the French guy, who knows what he's saying? Those myodiscs he's wearing are intriguing. Any idea of the RX there?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2008, 21:37</p><p>Just had a similar experience to the one I posted the other day...I was at the gym (one I don't usually go to) in the locker room, and had another one of my contact-taking-out viewings. But wow, this was a really good one! The guy went to a locker near mine, and I immediately noticed that he was very good looking -- tall, very nice build, white, early 30s, short brown hair with a slightly receding hairline, looked like a hunky young attorney. He was all sweaty from his workout. I didn't pay too much attention until -- of course --- I saw the glasses case and contact lens case come out of his locker. He took the glasses out of the case, then uncapped the contact case and started pinching out his lenses. The contact case was resting on the bench behind his glasses, and I could see that the contact case looked very very small through the lens of his glasses.  Yes!!  He held the case very close as he put the last contact in, and then put on his glasses.  Oh wow, this already very hot guy looked SO sexy with his black rim glasses on, his blue-gray eyes tiny, his RX about -8. The lens edges stuck out from his frames quite a bit too. VERY nice.... and he looked really relieved to have his contacts out, too. I watched him as long as I could...but unfortunately I also noticed a wedding ring. This guy was so my type, I was getting kind of a weird heart-pounding feeling.. I love when that happens!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest555</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2008, 07:14</p><p>Tinyeyes...  that sighting about the guy removing his contacts sounds just great!! I've done that myself b4 taking a flight and on some other occasion, (like when I'm at work and my contacvts start bothering me after some hours in front of the screen) and I've found people looking at me with a mixed thrill and surprised look... I guess it all has to do with most people thinking that the putting/taking out contacts thing is one of the most difficult tasks in the world, and watching it being done with such ease and calm... don't you think??</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2008, 08:30</p><p>I was traveling this week and as usual, had a number of interesting sightings. Airports are great for seeing a variety of good looking guys, many with surprisingly strong RXs. One fun sighting was in the airport bathroom, where I saw a very cute guy in his early 20s taking out his contacts (probably in preparation for a long flight). Then he took his glasses out of a case, cleaned them carefully and put them on. His RX was only about -3 or so, but watching a guy remove contacts and put on glasses is a favorite fantasy for me.  </p><p> </p><p>Also, at the event I traveled to, there was a tall, ex-military type guy, late 30s maybe, who wore glasses around -10. What made it more interesting is that his glasses were large round wire-rims, and very thick with flat fronts. They looked like they were from the early 1990s. The cut-in and concentric rings were amazing! He had light blue eyes that looked small and distant in his specs. I think they may have been CR39. I remember when that type of glasses were popular and I miss it a little! I saw him switching from the glasses to a pair of RX sunglasses once, but he was too far away for me to check out the sunglasses. They must have been thick too!  He made the switch seamlessly, using one hand to remove his glasses while the other hand brought the sunglasses to his face. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cut-in UK </b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2008, 23:57</p><p>VFL, I'm with you all the way on the effect of power rings. For me it is that flicker as a -5 to -7 woman turns their head slightly towards you and half a dozen or so rings suddenly fill the side of the lens! It is a defining moment, even though I do not have the gift of being as overtly expressive or passionate as yourself,(I'm English, and traditionally educated!) I can still sense that trigger of a 'rush'. It really is great for those O-O's  who have the 'ring thing' badly. Also, I'm aware that even that phenomenon has variations, as you clearly get the 'rush' with even higher myopes, straight-ahead. This is really the wrong thread; more technical than gender-specific, sorry, but I love a girl that 'gushes'.  </p><p></p><hr>

I wear both lined bifocals and progressives with a +3 add and have no problem switching between them. The index of the progressives is 1.67 and are 13mm. BTW what is your RX? </p><p></p><hr>

Am I correct that if you had not had your lenses rolled/beveled they would have been even thicker?  Do you have high-index lenses?  You have probably posted more details re you Rx at some point in the past, but I don't recall.  How old were you when you first started wearing glasses?  And do you have bifocals, trifocals or progressives?  Again, my apologies if you have posted all this before.

<p><b>guest555</b>&nbsp;16 Jul 2008, 09:05</p><p>Eustace: </p><p>I really think guys wearing glasses AND braces look adorable since it creates such a thrilling "tender and vulnerable" look, besides, kissing (or blow-jobing) a guy in/with braces it's such a hot experience. I can tell on both sides being myself a wearer a few years ago and believe me, every guy I kissed commeented on how good it felt! (man, it sounded like me being such a manwhore! damn!

(Perhaps we should exchange some "off-line" e-mails.)  Yes, I thought the young guy with the accent (British?), glasses, and braces was adorable.  I agree with 555 that the combination of glasses and braces is just wonderful!  However, I did not think his frames were very flattering--at least for his face.  He appeared to be a high hyerope, and I must confess that I am much more attracted to high myopes.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2008, 17:37</p><p>Brian-16, </p><p>With your Rx and prism, CR-39 is an extremely good choice.  It has extremely good optical characteristics and a much better "Abbe Number" (a measure of chromatic and spherical aberration characteristics) than most high index materials until you get to optical glass. With prism, the good abbe value means minimal color fringing.  The only downside to CR-39 is its relatively low index of refraction (around 1.50) which means that the lens will be comparatively thick. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2008, 15:34</p><p>Eustace - The lenses are about 11mm but just less than half an inch.I have never asked if they could make them in high index.I guess they could.I always am interested in checking out guys in strong thick lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2008, 15:30</p><p>guest555- A lot of times when I am out the guys ask me if my glasses are "bullet-proof". I just let the comments go by.By the way corrected I am 20/30 overall.But I am content with that vision level.The doctor said thats because of some muscle problem from a long time ago.My friend does have 20/20 but always says things look a little smaller and distant.He does not go to the same doctor I have.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2008, 15:27</p><p>Brian-16: </p><p> </p><p>Guest555's latest post arouses more questions from me:  (1) I would love to know how thick your lenses are on the outer edges--either in inches or centimeters.  (2)  Are you attracted to other guys with very think lenses? </p><p>(3) Could your Rx be refracted in high index, if you chose? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest555</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2008, 13:40</p><p>Brian:  </p><p>My comment was merely based on the reactions I've got myself from my circle of gay friends and people I've met so far as a -10 wearer (got new glasses recently and jumped from -9 to -10) ... they are like "such nice eyes and face and those weird glasses" but all I do i caring less than nothing. As long as I can see, it's all that matters. Just like you, I'm never fully corrected, all I can get it's a 20/40 due to some corneal issues but is ok, I'm still pretty functional and I can drive in daylight. As for you glasses, they sound really amazing, being so thick and yet you like them!! You must look really hot and interesting... what do guys at clubs ask you about them? When I was younger I used to care a lot about mine, but nowadays it's something I enjoy, all the attention and stares I get with my glasses... My former BF was very supportive and grew to like them a lot, he insisted me on wearing them as much as I could, and now I think of it, I think he might've turned out to become a little turned on about being with a high myopic guy... </p><p></p><hr>

I believe that if you walked into two bars (one gay, one straight) with the same number of guys in each, that each would have about the same number of guys that need (or once needed) correction.  The straight bar would have more guys in glasses, some in contacts, and a few who had lasik.  The gay bar will have many CL wearers, several who have had lasik, and rare few with glasses.  That's my two cents on the subject.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Presbyope Lover</b>&nbsp;09 Jul 2008, 02:42</p><p>Quick question to the group.....do you think gay guys are more into glasses?  Seems like there are quite a few of us in here.....and if so ...why?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2008, 21:25</p><p>Craig is still posting videos in his glasses occasionally: </p><p><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=CAyJ-1RIfVg" target="_blank">http://youtube.com/watch?v=CAyJ-1RIfVg</a> </p><p> </p><p>I never get tired of seeing him in his strong spex! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2008, 20:27</p><p>So I was in the locker room at the gym tonight, and I saw this guy with glasses. He wasn't looking at me so it was hard to tell, but the glasses looked like they had a significant RX. For a second I thought he looked like this guy I went out on a coffee date with a couple of months ago, but I decided it wasn't. Then he looked up at me and said hi -- turned out it was him! He had told me when me met before that he wore contacts, but I hadn't seen him in glasses before. His RX looked to be maybe -5 at the most, but it defintely made me much more attracted to him! He's white, tall and lanky, and kind of sexy-nerdy even without the glasses, so of course with the -5s I was ready to jump him! He mentioned that he just got off a plane a few hours earlier, so maybe that's why he wasn't wearing his contacts. Normally, -5 isn't that exciting to me (I've got a terrible fetish for high myopia), but there is something about this guy. I don't know how compatible we are otherwise, but I had to call him and leave him a message after I left the gym.  </p><p> </p><p>As long as I'm posting, I'll mention that I saw an Asian guy at the same gym with what looked like about a -13 or -14 RX -- amazing! But I didn't find him attractive at all, and he seemed straight anyway. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>royboy</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2008, 19:13</p><p>-10, thanx for the john lennon exhibit link --- very touching. ive never seen a review like this referring  so prominently to an individuals glasses. JL's glasses at the time seemed so much just a  part of him  and were noticed subconsciously --- so much so that an extreme OO like myself never fixated on his glasses! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2008, 15:32</p><p>One other thing.  I love seeing a guy who wears glasses full time in his sunnies for the first time.   </p><p> </p><p>I once had a guy I worked with walk with me from his office to lunch.  It was 5 maybe 6 blocks away and when we got there he realized he'd left his clear specs on his desk.  He didn't say anything at first, just paused for a moment as though he were thinking, then took the glasses off for just a moment.  He looked around and blinked a few times as though to clear the fog, then just put them back on. </p><p> </p><p>The sheepish way he asked if I minded if he left the sunnies on was so endearing I could have kissed him.   </p><p> </p><p>Of course he was a potential employer so that wouldn't have been the thing to do.  It didn't stop me from wanting to, though. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2008, 09:50</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>VFL:  Yesterday I was having lunch at a pizza parlor and watched a very good-looking guy wear his prescription sunglasses throughout lunch.  Out of solidarity, I presume, his less attractive pal sat with his non-presciprion sunglasses on throughout their lunch.  At one point, when the non-presciption friend was watching the overhead tv, the cute one lifted his glasses for several seconds to look at the counter but quickly let them drop back on his nose.  My estimate was that they were at least a -4/5 thus making them necessary for even seeing things clearly up close.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2008, 08:38</p><p>Over the holiday weekend I was thinking about how cute it is to watch the boys make the switch from their clear glasses to sunglasses.  One in particular was sitting on the deck and leaned so far over his lap to do the old switcharooni he must be practically blind without them. Plus he did it so quickly I nearly laughed.  What a self conscious move on his part. He laid the case on the umbrella table next to his drink.  I kept stealing glances at that case so often you would have thought it was Pandora's box.  He didn't even lift his head until the switch was made.  Gotta see this boy bareeyed.  Just gotta.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2008, 11:41</p><p>Good comments, all. I just have to laugh at online guys like that and move on. I may try to be a little less aggressive about glasses and Rx questions, though. It seems to scare some guys off. I do find that people are often  ruder online -- sort of the way people are ruder when driving a car -- because they can get away with it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2008, 08:24</p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>I find that online some guys are more willing to be seen in glasses, others say it's an odd request, in which I respond, I've heard odder things online. </p><p> </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2008, 11:42</p><p>In my experiences I have found that gay guys are open to talking about their glasses when I initiate the conversation with a compliment about the style of their glasses.  From there the subject of prescription will come naturally.  I have also noticed that more gay guys know their prescription.  Probably from also having contacts which list it on the package.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest555</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2008, 09:12</p><p>Tinyeyes: as for this guy, I do actually think he might be a "band-member" as he had a very warm approach the moment he picked up the coin I dropped... str8 guys are not usually that kind.. but who knows, he might be some sort of a good samaritan only... anyway, concerning your question for being too straight-forward asking a guy for a pic of him in glasses, it doesn't seem to be a harmful nor a twisted-minded request, just a "different" one I'd say...nothing to freak about.. as for me, I've never got an answer as rude as the one you got, I guess that guy's kinda resented with life for giving him the chance to see the world through some lenses... and yes, just like Brian, I've found gay guys are more open to talk about glasses and contacts more than other people... I guess it all has something to do with our broader horizons...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2008, 04:42</p><p>Tinyeyes- In my experience at college I find gays more than non gays more willing to chat about their glasses and eyesight.Of course I like to strike up a conversation first.This past year (my third) I do notice more students with bi-focals.I guess the strain of so much reading has taken its toll.Who says lined bifocals are out of date?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2008, 23:16</p><p>Guest, your encounter was just great! Did you get the idea that the guy might be gay  or interested in you? Even if not, it's still fun to talk to him about his glasses, huh?? He sounds just dreamy!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest555</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2008, 15:54</p><p>Hey, hello everyone! Dropped-by just to report I got the chance to have a small talk with the clear glasses guy, as we both were in line for our usual morning coffee!! I hadn't seen he was in line right in front of me (very long waiting line actually, everone's waiting fort something to wake-up) till I dropped a coin (I wonder, was it just mere unconcious accident?) and he leaned down to pick it up same time as me. We both smiled at each other, I said "thank you", he smiled back once more and then, right then and there, I gathered all my nerve and said "I've seen you here before..." He turned out to be very nice and friendly, a little geeky tho, but very nice. He realised I was wearing my glasses as well and suddenly we were talking about eyesight issues. He said his contacts are kinda uncomfortable lately and he's back in glasses for a while, besides, he says he's OK with wearing them, as it gives him a chance to rest his eyes. I asked about his RX and said it was about -12 , that his lenses were the thinnest his optician could get and they were fine... I mentioned I like glasses quite a bit, and he was kinda surprised to hear me say that... as Tinyeyes mentioned, he could've been bothered by this straight-forward comment and say bye-bye immediatly, but he just kept talking till we both got our orders. Hesaid goodbye by saying "Hope to see you later dude" and left... what a sighting! don't you think??</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2008, 23:19</p><p>Awesome! Good luck with the clear glasses guy!  I have sightings from time to time but I don't usually write about them. Here's an interesting one: I saw a guy at the gym the other day (Asian, late 20s maybe?) who had glasses that looked like they were about -3 in one eye and about -8 and much thicker in the other eye!  That's always an unusual thing to see. It must be odd to have vision like that where one eye is so much better than the other.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest555</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2008, 10:20</p><p>hey y'all! I saw the cutie guy in the clear glasses again! Just as I thought, he's a regular at the Starbucks I usually attend! This time I saw him in a rush, as I was about to leave and he was arriving  (in a casual attire, light baby blue shirt, khaki pants and some nice shoes, no blazer) and wearing the "spec"tacular clear glasses! I nooded at him as I was leaving hoping for him to remember our last saturday eye-encounter, to which he just smiled back slightly in a  very friendly way... I hope I can run into him this coming weekend so I might gather the nerve to talk to him... now I just can't get enough of him!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest555</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2008, 10:10</p><p>It's been a while, and there seems to be just a little action arounf here... hasn't any of you guys had a sighting to report, or an experience to tell lately? I wanted to share a sighting I had last weekend, when I was at Starbucks getting some brown sugar for my order, I saw this guy entering and even though he was nice-looking (5' 7" aprox, slim, fair skin, brown hair, wearing blue jeans, white t-shirt and a blueish leather jacket, very stilysh), it was his glasses the thing that got my attention (I mean, c'mon, isn't it always the same??)... clear (and I mean cristal clear) plastic frames with thick (frame-width, actually)arms with some white decorations and a tiny silver-brand logo (I think they were Armani o something like that) holding very thick minus lenses I'd put in the -10 or something range, lots of power rings, quite a cut-in, very clear polished lenses, which I was able to see properly only when looking at his face, the extremely thick clear arms were quite a move to conceal his high myopia, giving the "My lenses are thick but you can't tell 'cause they look like one-single-clear-piece" look... He got in line and was looking at the menu-board when suddenly realised I was looking at him (that sugar was taking long to get!), gave me a slight smile (I blushed) and continued to place his order. I went back to my seat and continued watching... 4 minutes later he got his order, by the name "Freddy" and left just like that... I want to think he's a regular to this Starbucks, so I maybe get to run into him!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest555</b>&nbsp;28 May 2008, 07:22</p><p>about the video posted on the chinese guy... I don't understand a word, and wosrt of all, even though the video lasts over 25min we never get a chance to see any glasses on the guy!! all we see at the end is him getting an intraocular lens and it seems it works fine since we see him smiling at theend... on the other hand, I can't hardly believe this guy's rx was -42!! I mean, I've met people in the -25 and beleive, that level of myopia is equal to being blind without really being vblind... -42 sounds more like being blind with just some light reaching the eye... I don't think he was able to see anything... say, what's the highest amount of myopia you guys have seen so far (in a guy or gal, whatever)??? in my case, I met an old friend of gramps' bearing -27 in eye while -23 in the other. He wore myodiscs lenses and when we meet, he saw my glasses and mentioned he had sorta my level of myopia when he was a boy. His eyes were extremely tiny and you could only see them looking closely and straight in his lenses.. If he had been younger, I would've gone for him, for sure!! I love guys in thick glasses like mine!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest555</b>&nbsp;23 May 2008, 10:15</p><p>Concerning the guy in those videos, I do think he's got very limited and low vision even with his thick glasses. His eyes seem to be very weak (they actually look like a blind's person eyes)being unfocused, and squint-like. He seems very concerned about blind and low vision people, so I guess he's quite related to such conditions. Those glasses seem to be above -15, not yet to the -20 in wich his eyedoc would've suggested biconcave or lenticular eyeglasses. IMO, this guy's concerned about the blind in the same way we all high myopes know what's like not being able to see properly, we all feel like part of a "brotherhood" and understand how people conceive our condition. In my case, every time I meet a high myope like me the subject rises up and suddenly we're talking about things we only understand, like poor night vision, contact lenses, lenses' thickness, etc etc...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;23 May 2008, 07:31</p><p>Wow. What do you think his Rx is? I noticed he is concerned about the blind. Does he have low vision with glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

Was he embarrassed about his strong RX? More details would be great. For instance, did he put on his glasses to see the bedside clock, or just lean very close to see it? Did he continue to wear contacts full-time throughout the relationship? Hopefully he indulged you at night or at  home by wearing his specs (and giving his eyes a rest.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest555</b>&nbsp;21 May 2008, 07:19</p><p>As Tinyeyes and Cactus have already said, RGP stands for Rigid Gas Permeable contact lenses, so, I guess the point's made clear... As for your experience, it sounds truly amazing how luck works sometimes, being a high-myopic guys' admirer ending up in a relationship with a very high-myopic boy right next to you without even knowing!! I'd like to know how he reacted furthermore, was he supportive towards you "special taste"? did he wear his coke-bottles lenses instead of his CL's just to please you? In my case, recently I got into this relationship with a very myopic guy (around -16) but it ended very fast since we were just wrong right from the start, all the attraction for me towards him were his glasses, and he claimed he wanted an "open" relationship, term which I just don't like at all. (I'm not a side dish, I'm a main course!! ) anyway, things like these, in which people get together just for some particular shared interest or fact, leads to unsuccessful hook-ups most of the time... so sad!!  I think it's something really common, specially for us with this taste, (and so many others as well). Tinyeyes, browsing through old post I found some of your experiences and let me tell you, maybe not as as often as you, but I've been there, done that, meeting guys in thick glasses who are ashamed of them, wearing contacts 99.9% of the time (myself being a 95%, but that's another story), guys getting LASIK just because they think glasses don't fit the "regular gay guy" image (rubbish!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;20 May 2008, 15:02</p><p>Eustace, RGP means Rigid Gas Permeable... that's the newer form of hard contacts, basically.  Guest 555 mentioned that he thought the guy in the last photo link had a lot of cylinder in his RX-- I think that usually requires the hard lenses because crisp vision isn't always possible with soft lenses for someone like that. (I'm in the -9/-9.5 range in glasses with a lot of astigmatism, and I require RGP lenses myself.)  </p><p> </p><p>As for your story about your first boyfriend, what a delicious experience that first "reveal" must have been! I love it!  I have a couple of similar (true) stories that I posted to this forum a long time ago. Should I post again?  </p><p> </p><p>Highly myopic guys wearing contacts is my ultimate turn-on. I find it more exciting than someone wearing glasses full-time, even if a very strong RX. I think it's because I'm similar, and also because I love the "secret" being "revealed".... </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;20 May 2008, 15:00</p><p>Eustace, </p><p>RGP = Rigid Gas Permeable.  That means that they are hard contact lenses that let oxygen thru to get to the cornea.  The cornea has no blood supply and therefore its oxygen has to come from the air.  Early hard contacts were not gas permeable, which contributed to their discomfort and limited wearing time. The oxygen for the cornea had to come from the tear film that managed to get under the lens. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;20 May 2008, 14:36</p><p> </p><p>Thanks, guys, for all the wonderful high minuts photos and videos.  Guest555: What does RGP mean?  No one commented on my You Tube postings!  Can sometime tell me an easy way to cut and paste URL's onto an Eyescene post?  Your stories reminded me of my first long-time(9 years)lover.  When we first met, I had no idea he was very myopic but wore contacts.  On our first sleep-over date, somehow I was bold enough to mention that I was attracted to guys who wear very thick glasses.  He ask me to hold on a minute, and he went back to the bedroom where he had left his overnight bag and came back to the living room wearing wonderfully thick glasses in heavy metal frames.  They must have been at least a -9 (and I think this was before high-index).  I was in heaven! </p><p> </p><p>Eustace </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;20 May 2008, 10:16</p><p>Actually, the guy kinda broke up with me, and then moved away later.... we still talk sometimes though. He was a game-player and not the best person to be around, in reality... but definitely sexy and spexy! That is how it so often turns out.. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest555</b>&nbsp;20 May 2008, 07:27</p><p>Tinyeyes! so sad to learn your myopic friend is now so far away from you!! I bet he was a nice guy and spexy on top of it! So sad when 2 people meet, seem to get along very well and then PAF! suddenly, everything goes to c**p for some reason... Answering your question, Yeah, my glasses were kinda thick, since -9 is my CL's Rx, and as for glasses I think is somewhere in the -10.... in a rather big (51mm wide) plastic frame and I guess the mignifying effect was quite significant... As for the guy wearing spex in the pic... I'd estimate a -16 or more... and it seeme to me there's a lot of cyl going there... maybe this guy's a RGP lenses wearer giving his warped and weary corneas a little rest while reading....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;20 May 2008, 00:02</p><p>I had a similar experience a few weeks ago . I was visiting a friend when his roommate who normally a somewhat attractive girl that I thought had 20/20 disappeared in her room for about half an hour, when she emerged my heart jumped a beat when she walked past us and I could clearly see glasses! (as well as a tshirt that did nothing to hide her assets :D). I followed her out to the kitchen and found that she was at least a moderate myope but the frames were dated plastic librarian types that made her look a lot older than she was :(  </p><p> </p><p>The few times we've chatted, she wants me to change my hair but I wouldn't mind  changing her glasses :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;19 May 2008, 21:42</p><p>Well, I guess that's one thing hetero guys and gay guys can agree on, at least when it comes to the glasses fetish! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>hetero guy</b>&nbsp;19 May 2008, 15:55</p><p>For straight guys, nothing turns on as much either as suddenly discovering that a girl we're dating is a high minus girl.  I dated a lovely girl 6 times, thinking she was 20/20.  On the 7th date she opens the door and there she is in high minus glasses with flat fronts.  My heart melted.  That was the first night we slept together,  She apologized for wearing her "ugly" glasses, because she had scratched her cornea.  Here's to scratched corneas!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;19 May 2008, 15:16</p><p>Wow, an experience like that would be a dream date for me, and a huge turn-on! NOTHING turns me on more than discovering that a guy with no glasses is actually very nearsighted.  These days, I wonder if most people can really detect how strong your lenses are though, with high-index lenses and all. Were your lenses particularly thick?  </p><p> </p><p>A couple of years ago I went on a few dates with a guy who I had no idea wore glasses, although I got a clue when he wasn't able to read a sign we were looking at in the distance once. I thought maybe he was slightly nearsighted. A couple of dates later, I went to his house to pick him up to go to a movie, and he opened the door wearing what must have been -8D glasses!  You can imagine my surprise (and arousal)!  Apparently his contact RX was in need of a bump!  I still remember the door opening, and seeing his handsome face framed in rectangular black frames with telltale cut-in, power rings, and small eyes.  When I complimented his glasses, he said the weather was so hot and dry (it was summer) that he just couldn't bear wearing his lenses any more that day, so he switched to glasses.  On another date, he came to my house (wearing contacts) but brought his contact stuff and glasses with him so he could change in case he spent the night (which he did.)  I LOVE the intimacy of being "in" on the contacts "secret" -- especially with a high myope! Unfortunately, my myopic friend lives halfway across the country now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest555</b>&nbsp;19 May 2008, 09:58</p><p>Regarding the article Tinieyes mentioned, has any of you guys who are myopic ever been set up for a date and been through the "my-contacts-hurt-like-hell" situation just to see your date's reaction towards the moment when high myopia's revealed to the counterpart??? I mean, I've been there, I'm a -9, and there was this guy I went out with for 2 previous dates, and on the 3rd I wanted to know what he would think about me being highly nearsighted. We went to this bistro place and kept rubbing my eye every now then, and he started to ask if I was OK. I said "yes, just a little dust got into my eye". Just after the waiter took our orders, I excused myself to the john saying my eye was itching, took my eyeglasses case (conveniently packed in my pocket) and went in... and then, I came back bespectacled... he just kept staring at me , I said "sorry about the glasses, but those damn things were killing me" and then he asked... are those your real glasses?? he was kinda surprised, mentioned he hand't thought that my eyes were so "damaged" (as he expressed)... I just said, "that's the way it goes for me". Dinner went through OK with no further comments on my eyesight (wich was kinda a turn-off, since I would've answered any question) and well, even though our relationship never developed to something more due to some other differences, I think he barely surpassed my little test... what do you guys think? ever had any experience like mine?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;18 May 2008, 20:35</p><p>Cool video...I love it when he has to hold the paper so close without his glasses! I don't think he's -10 though---probably more like -6 or -7. I wonder if that's the actor's real prescription? </p><p> </p><p>On another subject, I have a copy of the gay magazine "Instinct" for April 2008 (sorry for the late notice), and they have an item about 2 guys going on a blind date. One of the guys has glasses that look to be around -7 or so. I would have been pleasantly surprised if he were my blind date!</p><p></p><hr>

To me, this movie was an OO's dream!  I had so much fun watching it.  I already ordered a DVD copy from PBS!  It's been a long time since I've seen a film with so many references to eyesight.  It made me wonder if the screenplay was written by an OO???  I would have written just the same!  Love men in glasses!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jarred</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2008, 14:48</p><p>I recon the reason there seems less minification of Matts eyes than the cut in would suggest is because there is some prism in there too. There is definately something going on in the esotropia/exotropia front. I have about 11D base out of prism and have a little bit of cut in with a -2D CYL +2D SPH correction for astigmatism. Great picture though! Its a shame there isn't a side shot, if there is prism involved in what is already a high minus prescription I would imagine those lenses are pretty thick. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>alan</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2008, 00:58</p><p>Matt Boyle is certainly for real - I think, with smaller frames and thinner lenses, high myopes wear specs closer to their eyes than they used to; hence slightly bigger eyes but still amazing cut-in. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2008, 22:20</p><p>The Matt Boyle picture could be faked, but I think it's real. The photographer doesn't seem to have anything else like it  in his photos, or any reason to fake high myopia for a photo shoot. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark One</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2008, 23:12</p><p>James, </p><p> </p><p>The Actors thread has a link to several other shots from that series. Take a look at some of the other angles and the effect doesn't seem all that different from the pair he's wearing in the movie clips. I'd wager it was his real Rx at the time. The newer ones might be slightly stronger but more likely, you noticed an effect of that particular shot's angle. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2008, 21:02</p><p>Love the new shot of Wentworth. Are those glasses rimless? What a hottie!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2008, 11:17</p><p>I'd say it was obvious his Rx has increased - no one would bother to wear minus CLs under a minus Rx. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2008, 11:15</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I'd say it's -6/-7 and clearly his real prescription which, cosmetically, is  far too strong for his film work where it would show too much cut-in and too many power rings (not for us, of course!).  If his character requires glasses, he is probably filmed in a weaker pair or perhaps a combination of a weaker pair on top of contacts.  I really hate fake glasses and find it so annoying when you know a star is wearing contact lenses underneath the plano lenses.  Alfred Hitchcock also insisted on the real thing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2008, 08:55</p><p>Now I am getting confused. Wentworth's Rx looks significantly  stronger here ( <a href="http://img181.imagevenue.com/img.php?image=63674_afton11oo3_122_186lo.jpg" target="_blank">http://img181.imagevenue.com/img.php?image=63674_afton11oo3_122_186lo.jpg</a> ) than it did in that movie, which points to a number of possibilities: </p><p> </p><p>1. that was not his real Rx; </p><p>2. being in his twenties, his Rx is still increasing; or </p><p>3. he is just standing at a more "OO-delicious" angle in this shot </p><p> </p><p>Can somebody estimate the prescription based on this photo?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lurker</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2008, 08:42</p><p>I think his might be a case of "If you can't beat them, join them."  With glasses like his he has probably met guys who are turned off by them and those who are turned on. He has probably had more fun with the ones who are turned on and has decided to accept it and be upfront about it.  I once knew a guy who had bad eyes, but not as bad as this guy, and would post pictures without glasses on personals sites.  When guys met him in person they were disappointed because they were not expecting the thick glasses.  This guy is doing it right by basically saying 'this is who I am.  I have to wear these glasses that I am basically blind without and if that turns you on let's get together'  I'm with you Fritz, I wish he wasn't so far away.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2008, 09:50</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Looks like Cute Craig of YouTube fame has his own hair -- at least it looked real when he tugged at it in his latest video while wearing his really hot glasses.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2008, 20:55</p><p>tinyeyes, </p><p>Torics are only good for astigmatism.  So far, there is no way to put prism in contacts.  It might theoretically be possible, but they would be almost impossible to wear. Even torics move and rotate some on the eye and prism is even touchier than astigmatism regarding the positioning of the lens. </p><p>Reduction in apparent eye size is a very good indicator of Rx, the amount of reduction in size and cut-in are  related to the Rx and the vertex distance. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2008, 20:14</p><p>Thanks... I don't think I quite understood that distinction. So, with high amounts of prism, are toric contacts needed? Hmm, at any rate, the other way I gauge high myopia is by the "tinyeyes" effect of image reduction. That is a good indicator, right? That always seems to go hand in hand with cut-in, though...  Hmmm...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2008, 08:27</p><p>tinyeyes, </p><p>I didn't mention astigmatism in my comment about BI or BO prism affecting cut-in because astigmatism is not related to prism. Cylinder and axis usually correct for irregularities in the curvature of the cornea and prism usually corrects for muscle or eye position control problems and sometimes for accommodation problems. High cylinder could affect cut-in and the appearance of the lens, but it depends on the amount and the axis. </p><p>Toric soft contacts can be used to correct moderately high astigmatism if the contacts will stay in position with the axis aligned properly. There are many factors that can affect axial alignment of torics such as amount of astigmatism, tightness of eyelids, tearing, and skill and experience of the examiner. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2008, 21:34</p><p>Thanks for the tip, Cactus Jack. I knew that there is more to it than cut-in, but it's one of the best indicators I have for strength of prescription. I did date someone a few years ago who seemed very nearsighted, yet there wasn't much cut-in to his glasses. So are you saying such a person would have a lot of astigmatism? Would they be able to wear soft contacts (because he did)?   </p><p> </p><p>By the way, Craig looks really awesome in his new video wearing glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2008, 18:16</p><p>tinyeyes, </p><p>You can't always judge an Rx by the amount of cut-in at the outer edge of the lens. Base Out Prism can significantly increase the amout of cut-in at the outer edge and Base In can significantly reduce the cut-in. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2008, 07:19</p><p>Actually, looking again, maybe his RX is even higher. Maybe -13 or -14? The cut-in is amazing! What do you think?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2008, 07:17</p><p>I'm no expert! Funny thing, his profile says he's only 21, but he looks much older. The RX? Hmm, I'd say he's around -12 or so maybe. It's funny the way he takes his glasses off in videos. He must not have contacts. </p><p></p><hr>

My fantasy might be embellished (or detailed) a bit:  Both guys are naked and do not remove their glasses at night until after turning out all the lights, and both put their glasses on before they get out of bed.  Even better if both have very thick lenses--with Rx of -10 or higher.  Even better if at least one of them wears bifocals--or even trifocals.  And, of course they shower (perhaps together?) with their glasses on, etc., etc.  Well, I could go on . . . .  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2008, 19:12</p><p>Wish we'd had more of a glimpse, but yeah, I would guess Ben's RX to be around -4 or -5. I like his glasses, but it doesn't hurt that he's extremely good-looking, too. I would love to get a better look at Ronnie's glasses, too!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2008, 11:08</p><p>Oh, I know!  I go crazy over just the thought of a man putting his glasses on before even throwing back the covers.

Add this to the fantasy...  you are his partner lying in bed on your stomach beside him while you both gaze out the Manhattan skyline together, snuggling under the covers to soak up that last bit of warmth before getting up and mock fighting over who gets to make the coffee.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>nzoptic</b>&nbsp;02 Feb 2008, 22:25</p><p>A glorious summer day in New Zealand enhanced by a glorious sighting. Sitting outside a cafe in the sun four beautiful guys happy with themselves. All wearing glasses, two in sunglasses so did not take much notice of them; but the other two! One wearing the latest (in New Zealand anyway) IC Berlin frame in silver perhaps best described as rectangular with curved corners and almost straight temples.  Lens about -3, fair stylish hair, beautifully dressed and a really good looker.  The other wore glasses similar to the late James Dean, lower minus about -2, in a light brown colour.  Both pairs perfect for the wearers. A great sighting. I had to go in to the cafe to look out the window for another angle, left and went down the road a bit and came back to have another look.  Truly glorious!  </p><p></p><hr>

Whether gay or straight, though, I think he's in a relationship because in his other videos he talks about "we" a lot, as in "we" like to throw parties, etc. By the way, if you look at his other videos, he shows his old glasses he got 18 years ago, but he doesn't try them on.  </p><p> </p><p>I really like him-- I think he's cute and seems nice and his glasses/RX are awesome. Check back because he says he will post a video wearing his glasses as soon as he gets them back from the optician.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2008, 14:02</p><p> </p><p>tinyeyes and royboy -- did either of you listen carefully to the video that guy did when he found out that he had lenses too strong for his prescription? </p><p>He mentioned that they referred to him as a "she" so that he wouldn't know they were talking about him and the error the lab had made.  Geez, doesn't he know they were being rude and, of course, assuming he was gay.  I can't imagine him not being gay and, if he isn't, then he's really got an identity problem. </p><p> </p><p>Good sighting here in SF.  A rather cute late thirty-something with a sharp widow's peak and biconcave lenses in an extremely small oval frame.  Estimate:  -15/-16.  Another great sighting in my club's locker room: a stocky guy with clean-cut Irish looks and very trendy (and extremely small) rectangular plastic frames which were a sort of clear red.  I'd guess his lenses were at least -14 with a lot of cut-in, numerous power rings and, I think, slightly biconcave.  Quite hot. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;24 Jan 2008, 11:35</p><p>Matt: I see what you mean, but I think what you think is a bifocal line is the edge of the lens, and the lower line is its shadow on his cheek.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mattp</b>&nbsp;24 Jan 2008, 07:34</p><p>And in #21, it looks like his glasses are bifocals.</p><p></p><hr>

The other guy seems gay to me, but probably has not idea that people would find his glasses erotic. But I certainly do! I loved his description of  wearing his powerful lenses for the first time and how tiny everything looked. Look at his other videos-- in his first one he shows off his 18-year old glasses with a broken earpiece, and in another video he describes about how his new glasses were actually -13s and that's why he was having trouble with them! I hope he does more videos wearing his glasses, next time without his contacts on! LOL he was wearing like -24 diopters of correction with both on!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2008, 15:19</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes - Great sighting in SF!  I live in San Francisco and have always thought that more men will wear strong glasses here than in LA.  As I have always maintained, however, most people are oblivious to lens strength unless the lenses aren't hi-index and are noticeably thick (something you don't seem much of anymore.)  I'm having dinner tonight with an Asian friend who is 40, tall and quite good-looking.  Best of all, he wears glasses that are somewhere between -10 and -11.  Too bad he's straight!! </p><p> </p><p>I should be in LA and the Desert over the next several weeks and will have to put my theory to the test.  Oh, thanks for the video links.  Those two guys are awesome, although it was too bad that the Latino (?) didn't speak.  I think his new glasses were stronger than the old pair they replaced.  Any thoughts?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2008, 23:28</p><p>Just took a short business trip to San Francisco and had a number of good OO sightings.  The airport was especially good-- I saw a very good-looking, scruffy guy in his late 20s who was wearing powerful plus lenses when reading, but took them off when he got up and walked around. They looked strong to me, so I was surprised he was able to do fine without them.  </p><p> </p><p>Best of all was a smaller-build, fairly cute guy in his 30s with dark features (Jewish or Israeli maybe), who was wearing what must have been -14s or -15s. Amazingly, his glasses weren't very thick (the frames were small). In fact, even though his eyes looked very small and the cut-in was deep, he looked pretty normal and I think most people wouldn't notice how strong his glasses were (except for an OO like me, of course.) He had a great pair of glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2008, 21:32</p><p>Forgot to mention, I assume he's wearing RGP hard lenses because I can see the edges of them inside the colored part of his eye. Hard lenses are usually much smaller than soft lenses, which would extend into the white of the eye. David's are actually pretty big for hard lenses, which surprises me considering the high power of his prescription. Contacts are just like glasses in that the larger they are, the thicker they are (with a minus RX). If I'm wrong, please correct me. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopic Grant</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2008, 07:38</p><p>I wonder how old this David guy is and how old he was when he started wearing glasses.  It would be interesting to see old pictures of him wearing different glasses over the years and how they gradually got stonger.</p><p></p><hr>

Definitely double digits. In one of his photos I could tell he was wearing RGP hard contacts, so he probably has a lot of astigmatism along with a very healthy dose of myopia. :-) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thanks James!</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2007, 13:27</p><p>His prescription is at least -10 and the small glasses certainly do suit him.  Based on his age, I bet he owned a very large pair in his teens or twenties and they probably weren't high index either.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2007, 11:40</p><p>Happy new year to all on this board! </p><p> </p><p>As a new years present, have posted 69 photos of a myopic (though unfortunately straight) librarian and computer geek to Guys Glasses 13, here </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/guysglasses13/photos/browse/c85b" target="_blank">http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/guysglasses13/photos/browse/c85b</a> </p><p> </p><p>He seems to have no special interest in / fetish for glasses, and yet, coincidentally, lots of the photos almost seem taken to titilate an OO. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, have posted some pics of him in contacts too, both to show the contrast, highlight his AMAZING eyes, but also because he is such a beautiful man I couldn't resist. </p><p> </p><p>From my stash of photos, it seems like he wears glasses more than 50% of the time. Think he is the PERFECT example of glasses fitting and suiting a person's face well - obviously he's wearing the tiny ovals that don't suit 90% of the people who choose to wear them, but somehow seem made for him. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, this guy does things to me, not sure if you guys agree. In any event, can some of the experts hazard a guess at his Rx?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mattp</b>&nbsp;07 Nov 2007, 08:02</p><p>I had an interesting sighting at a birthday party the other night.  Years ago, we were friends with a young couple; the husband/father wore some pretty serious plus glasses (magnified eyes, lenses beyond the frames on the top).  The couple got divorced early on, and we lost touch for a few years.  At the time, the son was maybe ten years old and did not wear glasses. </p><p> </p><p>The woman remarried, and we became friendly again with her and her new husband; we had not seen the son or father in many a year until the second husband's birthday party the other night.  The first husband was there (surprisingly) with his thick plussers, now in bifocals.  More interesting was the son's vision--now in his mid-thirties, he was wearing plus glasses close to his father's in strength.  Nice looking, he takes after his mother, but those glasses--he got his father's vision!  Interesting that he did not wear glasses at ten the last time I saw him--I would think that much hyperopia would have been evident then, although maybe, like most children, he refused to wear his glases. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mskay</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2007, 19:36</p><p>I was walking into my apartment building where I have lived for 3 years and as I got out of my car, a very handsome young guy got out of a car a few cars down.  He looked my way and I saw he was wearing wire rims frames with maybe a -3 or -4 prescription.  He had short dark hair and was very well built.  We walked into the same entrance then headed to different floors.  Hope I run into him again soon and get a better look and get a chance to talk.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dillusionbr</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2007, 12:59</p><p>I spotted a young guy on the train today: about 20 yo, tall and in good shape, closely cropped blond hair. He sat facing me but I didn't take much notice of him as he wasn't wearing his glasses -- until he was getting up to get off at the next station. He started fishing for his glasses in his backback and produced a rather small, rectangular, blueish-colored plastic frame with the most powerful plus lenses I've seen in years. Generally, I'm more into guys in strong minus glasses, but he definitely made my day. His rx must have been at least +8, maybe even more. A good friend of mine is a +6, and this guy's glasses were definitely stronger, so he had been sitting their in complete blur!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinuX16</b>&nbsp;09 Oct 2007, 11:25</p><p>Hello! James, sorry to disagree a little bit, but as a high-rx user I can tell you that when I'm not wearing eyeglasses, and I'm familiar with the location I'm in, I don't squint so often. I just keep my eyes open naturally and even better, since the CL's are not hurting my eyes (they do hurt a little bit, permanently, even if you're a long-time wearer) and I can manage as if I was able to see perfectly. It's quite hard to tell when somebody is wearing RGP CL's, since they're so tiny and do not get out of the iris region, but I can tell this guy knows what he's doing even if not being able to see the camera properly... and well, just a thought</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;04 Oct 2007, 20:31</p><p>OH, and in the excitement of the video, I almost forgot to mention my glasses sighting tonight. At the gym, a tall, muscular, good looking, very nearsighted young asian guy with great looking black framed glasses to match his jet black hair. His glasses were just thick enough to have a coke bottle look, and around -8 maybe. And yes, he was "tiny-eyed". It was fun stealing glances at him, but he seemed perfectly straight. He gave me a surprise bonus before I left though... I was in the bathroom area and he walked to the sink, took his glasses off and washed them under the faucet, washed his face, then stood back and looked at himself bare-eyed in the mirror (what could he possibly see?!) and then after drying the glasses  put them on as he walked away. WOW! </p><p></p><hr>

There was one guy who I think actually shared the fetish, but the relationship ended for other (very dramatic) reasons and we never got to explore the shared fetish further.

<p><b>MinuX16</b>&nbsp;01 Oct 2007, 13:03</p><p>Tinyeyes (gosh, I just can't help falling for you nickname, so cute!!) As you mentioned, meeting guys wearing thick minus glasses as we do is quite difficult and when the chance comes, it turns out either he's not interested or hates the fact he wears glasses, and often complains about the coke-bottles. In my case, it used to think that way, but nowadays it's not only that I wear my glasses when I'm feeling like it (actually, not so often, since I get better vision in CL's) but the fact that it's been sort of a prerrogative for me that I only date guys who wear glasses. I think a guy in glasses would react much better than a non-wearer when they find out I'm blind as a bat and when they see I wear the coke-bottle glasses, although it could turn out wrong...  in my case, if the guy  turns out to ask me to take off the glasses, it would instantly mean "Hasta la vista, baby" since they're a big part of who I am... anyway... and what about you guys, say, has any of you ever dated a high myopic guy with no issue with the glasses thing? I really wander how is it like actually being able to show off the thick glasses with no hesitation, but arousal or empowerment instead? any thoughts?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jay</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2007, 18:02</p><p>Julian and Fritz.  My harddisk gave up on me and so I had to wait until I could get a new one and transfer everything - it's been ages since I could get online again.  I had another eyetest but he said there was no significant increase (phew!) but gave me and add of +3.00 to help with reading.  I get my new glasses soon. The builder I told you about before turned up again and asked me to go to a pub but when I got there he wasn't wearing his glasses but contacts!  Damn I thought he looked so ordinary so I told him.  When we met again (another pub) he had his black spex on which really made my day. BTW Julian, I don't get my nearsightedness from my father - it comes from my mother and we all inherited it from her.  My father has allowed us to choose our new glasses ourselves so I'm going for the black frames in some kind of plastic. </p><p>Fritz:  I have THREE brothers (2 older 1 younger) and two sisters and we all wear glasses although my two older brothers now have contacts which leaves me and my younger siblings as the "foureyes" in the family.  My little brother Fred is very nearsighted at around -14 but proudly wears his spex and doesn't mind the names he's called.  I'm happy to be getting new glasses and don't mind the thick lenses now - at least I can see!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sam12744</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2007, 09:17</p><p>MinuX16,those glasses sound great and I would love to see you in them.Nothing turns me on more than a guy in thick,powerful glasses and the way you describe yours,they sound just perfect.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinuX16</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2007, 08:37</p><p>Tinyeyes (BTW, what a cute nickname) you're so right, having a pair of glasses as a backup is so right, specially for us, the high myopic... for me, they're very useful when I remove the CL's before going to bed, otherwise, I wouldn't be able to make my way to bed! and for so many other tasks as well. My eyesight it's damn bad at -16, so, I think your point's quite clear. Say, what kind of frame do you have? mine are suited in a black plastic CK frame 48 width and thick arms, in order to help me hide the thickness, and the lenses are 1.7 high index with AR coating. Although they cause a weird minifyng effect on my eyes due to the cylinder, I think they don't look that bad on me, they're still kinda fashionable, the only thing it's they're quite thick... I used to care a lot about that, but since's that the way things are, well, nowaways all I care it's that I can see and I like other guys in glasses. I think I'd like to have a BF that wears and likes glasses just like me, it think it would be so cool!! unfortunately, there seem to be only a small group of guys that like guys in thick glasses, and well, they tend to keep it a "secret" ... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2007, 20:42</p><p>I've been wearing hard or RGP contacts for many years, and I wear them for at least 12-14 hours per day as well. Sometimes I give my eyes a break from them and wear my glasses -- especially if I'm doing something that stresses my eyes, like taking a long flight. I have glasses of course, although in my teens and early twenties I actually went through a period where I didn't have any glasses with my correct RX -- only contacts. That wasn't the best. When you're highly myopic, it's nice to have glasses as a backup even if you only wear them at bedtime. I also see much better with contacts than glasses, and that's one of the reasons I don't wear my glasses very much. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinuX16</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2007, 13:06</p><p>hi Tinyeyes! well, the reason I just couldn't wear my RGP's last weekend is still a little unknown for me, I just couldn't keep one of the lenses in, it kept popping-out my eye with no reason, although I kept cleaning it often... so I couln't bare wearing just one (it's damn uncomfortable as you might know, being able to see crispy-clearly in one eye and almost blind in the another) so I decided to go for my glasses. Ams as far as I'm concerned to other people, I got all those stares due to the weird minifying effect the lenses have on my eyes, although I still think there might've been some other great guy just like you that was looking at me in other way.... anyway, say, have you ever had an experience like mine? how long do you wear your lenses per day? I do wear mine for about 12-14 hours per day, and I almost have no problems with them... and well, honestly, I do have a pair of glasses "just in case" and because I like wearing thick glasses just as I like seeing guys in them as well. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2007, 07:33</p><p>MinuX16, I would have been staring at you in your coke-bottles, too -- for different reasons than the people you saw, perhaps! I wear RGPs, too -- how come you weren't able to wear them that day? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinuX16</b>&nbsp;24 Sep 2007, 07:55</p><p>Hello everyone!! Yes, as you've said, taking a little break to go to the WC and refresh a pair of dried RGP CL's is a cool chance to try some other eyeglasses, actually, it's kinda fun, you know? the thrill, the rush, the mix of a little guilt with excitement... wow! BTW, I was going to tell, just this past saturday I've a "bad CL day" and had to spend the whole day wearing my glasses.... at first I was up to nothing since my vision doesn't reach a 100% in them, but later on I felt bored and went to the local mall for some shopping. I got quite a few stares regarding directly to my coke-bottled eyes, and honestly, I got a little aroused, since most people migth have thought that I wasn't able to see them properly (at a point it was true, the darker it gets, the blinder I go) but in the meantime I liked the idea of attracting that attention.... nice thing to do for a change... I might be doing it more often!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2007, 17:26</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>At least you two have an excuse to go to the john:  rewetting your own contact lenses and spending that extra bit of time doing a search.  No harm, really.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinuX16</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2007, 09:10</p><p>I fully agree with with Tinyeyes, checking out other people's glasses is a guilty pleasure... but surely a harmaless one! I don't think sneeking in the bathroom just the way he did it it's a bad thing. It just happened and that's all. I remember doing the very same thing at my uncle's during a sleep over his place when I was younger (by that time I didn't know why he and Peter, his BF at that time, would be living together and why they were so close) and when I entered the bathroom, I saw 2 pairs of glasses next to a bottle of CL's cleaning solution. I took one pair and tried them.... they were too weak for me, maybe about a -3, but the others made a significant change, maybe a -8 (considering I was a -7 at 15). I was kinda aroused, and nervous, so I finished my duties and got off. Later on I saw my uncle coming out of the bathroom wearing the thick glasses! then I understood the other pair were Peter's. I liked the way they both looked in glasses (an together actually) So sad they splitted up... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2007, 08:32</p><p>Checking out people's glasses is a guilty pleasure. I don't get the opportunity that often, but I'm sure I'll do it again! You ask how did the glasses look on me? Actually, I was in a hurry for obvious reasons, so I spent more time checking out the vision with them than looking at myself in the mirror. And since I only popped out my right contact when I tried them on, the left eye had about -17 diopters of correction and was very blurry! </p><p> </p><p>There is another friend/date, hunky gay guy who is around a -6 or so, but I've only seen him in glasses a couple of times. He invited me to spend the night and cuddle sometime. In that case I'm sure I'll get to see him in his glasses and try them out (and he'll see mine too.) If it happens I'll report back. </p><p> </p><p>I love hearing these bathroom/hidden glasses stories, so please share more!</p><p></p><hr>

And years ago I only discovered just how myopic the wife of a friend was when I tried on her old brown NHS-style frames which she kept in the bathroom. Lovely power rings! In those days she wore contacts. Now she's a consultant psychiatrist and a fulltime gwg with very high index progressives; and she looks just gorgeous.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2007, 00:43</p><p>tinyeyes - yes! If there are a pair of (minus) glasses left in a bathroom, I have to try them on, I can't help it. I went to stay with a friend a few months ago, whose boyfriend has got some great black plastic frames with lenses that looked quite strong to me. I was dying to know his rx, especially as he had tried my boyfriend's -6s on and said he could see quite well (there was my opportunity to ask, I know!). In the bathroom at their house, I had to have a look, and found the box of contacts: -4! Not sure why they look so strong, maybe the wide frames. I did feel guilty, but pleased he hadn't beaten my bf for minus power :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2007, 23:20</p><p>I did something tonight that I really shouldn't do, but couldn't resist.  </p><p> </p><p>I went to visit a former co-worker I hadn't seen in a while, and I already knew that his boyfriend (who is very attractive, tall, slim and muscular) is very nearsighted. When I got there, the boyfriend was there, looking good as I remembered, and wearing contacts (I saw him once in his glasses a few years ago and he looked great.)  After a few minutes, I excused myself to go to the bathroom. Here's the bad part: I did a little snooping. As I had hoped, his eyeglasses case was on the bathroom counter. Of course, I couldn't resist opening up the case. Inside was a pair of silver frame oval glasses with high-index lenses, which of course, I couldn't resist trying on. They were quite strong, and I popped out one of my own contacts to get a view. I could see pretty well; they seemed almost as strong as my own (I'm -9). Even better, on the shelf were some boxes of AcuVue disposable contacts with the prescription printed on them: -8 in one eye and -8.5 in the other. Nice!   </p><p>A guilty pleasure, but hopefully no harm done. Has anyone else every done this sort of thing?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sam12744</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2007, 03:47</p><p>Nice little sighting yesterday in Boots the Chemists.Tall lad of about 19,not specially good looking with a mop of dark brown hair.Wearing some strong minus glasses.Current fashion of rectangular black plastic,with wide black arms,which branched into two white metal sections for the last 3/4 inch to the hinges.The lenses were clearly very high index material and yet still quite thick,with much minification and serious cut-in.I would estimate a minus script in the mid-teens.The frames suited him well and,given the strength and thickness of the lenses,were a sensible choice.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2007, 00:08</p><p>So, Jay, how old are you if your father dictates what kind of frames you can have? Presumably you've inherited your myopia from him if he thinks about lens thickness? (Mind you, when I was 18 my mother insisted on basic NHS plastic, but that was because she was paying.)</p><p></p><hr>

My advice to you is to get the hottest frames and the highest indext lens material.  Even if they're somewhat thick, so what.  Make a statement and don't worry if your lenses look strong.

<p><b>Jay</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2007, 16:40</p><p>Don't mind the questions Julian.  They are some kind of plastic as far as I could tell from just having a quick look and feel.  Although the lenses were very strong the whole frame didn't feel too heavy on my face.  I wanted to get spex like these but my father insisted that we have these small metal frames because they would keep down the thickness of the lenses.  Just recently he has relented and let us choose our own so I'm having new glasses soon and hope that Ican get something like these sexy Asians have!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2007, 09:13</p><p>Jay: sorry, another question! You say your delicious hunk's glasses were 'big, round and black' - what were they (the frames I mean) made of? And, while we're on the subject, what kind of frames do you wear yourself?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jay</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2007, 06:46</p><p>Julian. </p><p>Thanks.  Yes, I am nearighted and wear strong lenses of -9 so it was fairly obvious to him that I was "blind as a bat."  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;02 Sep 2007, 05:18</p><p>Jay, if you said you're blind I didn't notice. I only asked because he was hardly going to start comparing notes with somebody who didn't have a substantial show of power rings - as I guess with your Rx you must. I mean, I wear glasses, but I'm not in your league (low plus).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jay</b>&nbsp;01 Sep 2007, 16:42</p><p>Fritz and Julian </p><p>Thanks for the feedback.  It was a real turn on for me to talk with him about out mutual bad eyesight problems but I'm nowhere like as nearsighted.  He was around -14 (and his glasses were way too strong for me to see properly) and I'm -9.50L and -8.25R at my last check but I have to have another test and expect that to change.  I know I said I was blind and realise that some people are worse than me but over a certain Rx without correction I just can't see much.  I expect it's a relative term. </p><p>Jay. </p><p></p><hr>

I have always liked hunky construction worker types with thick glasses.  Seems so incongruous.  I recently checked out a really hot Latino guy who was working with a construction gang and probably wearing -10s.  Am sure that none of his other workmates had even a clue just how blind their co-worker was without correction.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jay</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2007, 13:37</p><p>Just spent the bank holiday with my aunt in Cambridge.  She has builders doing work but this morning when I came down to breakfast, what a sight! A hunk about my own age was hard at work pushing a barrowload of sand but it was his glasses which captivated me.  They were big, round and black with amazingly thick lenses - he'd be blind without them.  At their tea break I asked to give them the tea and got to speak to him.  He saw I was wearing spex too and said what a drag it was being so bind and so I said, How blind are you then?  He let me have his glasses and wow!  I couldn't focus at all.  He said his rx is -14 and with lots of astigmatism so we compared spex for a while.  I told him I didn't mind wearing glasses at all now and he just laughed and asked if it didn't turn off girls.  Not a problem in my case I said.  He got the message.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chris</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2007, 12:42</p><p>In a nearby resturant yesterday I was the first customer and was served by a good-looking young guy with very long, wavy hair aged about 17 or 18, I guess a student doing a holiday job.  He was explaining what was on offer and then said "And the specials are on the board over there" pointing at the opposite wall.  With my poor sight I asked him to read them to me and to my suprise he blushed and from his inside jacket pocket produced a pair of rimless specs - and he turned out to be nearly as myopic as me.  He had to squint a bit to read everything and so at my suggestion kept on his glasses for the rest of the time I was there.  Since they weren't busy I managed to have some conversation (about eyes and specs of course!) and complemented him on his glasses which really did suit him.  He told me that he'd had the same RX for two years now but accepted my suggestion that he get a test ASAP.  Altogether a nice young man and a nice evening for me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2007, 09:55</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yesterday Ithink I saw the thickest myopic glasses ever on a modestly good-looking white guy about 28/29.  The lenses were in a frame a bit too large for the prescription, but it probably wouldn't have made all that much differenc if it had been a bit smaller in diameter.  The lenses were biconcave, had been beveled and an estimated three-quarter inches thick on the edges.  (I'm also including the bit that also stuck out from the front of the frame.) They were certainly high-index and probably -25/-27 judging by the thickness,the enormous amount of cut-in and masses of power rings.  His eyes were actually hard to see clearly, and I doubt that he had anything approaching 20/20 juding by the way he held his iPod to his face to see it.  I think he was also squinting to see if the bus was coming, although it was hard to tell because his eyes were so distant behind the lenses.  You'd have thought he would have had myodiscs at that stage which would have been far less noticeable and probably provided less distortion.   </p><p> </p><p>Again, not a major cutie but some appeal.   </p><p> </p><p>Last night in a restaurant, a very good-looking Italian-type (about 55)beautifully dressed with a gorgeous Cartier watch walked in with rather plain wire-rimmed glasses about -7.  Looking around the well-lit bar for his companion (clearly gay) I noticed that he was squinting slightly trying to see across the room.  A moment later, out came a new pair of very cool rectangular glasses, plano-fronted and at least another diopter stronger.  End of squinting!! but he had to move them down his nose a bit to read the bar menu.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;20 May 2007, 01:31</p><p>Went to a party tonight, for a friend's birthday, and had a very nice, extended sighting of his cousin (who was a straight guy) .... very good looking, hunky, tall Asian guy, in his early 20s, with really nice black rim glasses with around -8 power. They had edges thick enough to stick out well past the plastic frames, and great power rings and cut in. It was really nice to see this handsome guy confidently wearing his strong prescription. (By the way, my friend with birthday is also around a -7 or -8 I think, but I've never seen him in glasses because he always wears contacts.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>not so new guest</b>&nbsp;17 May 2007, 20:43</p><p>Euestace suggested that I cross post this one from the nearsightings thread: </p><p> </p><p>funny you should mention the bare eyed and barefoot thing. A couple of years ago I went to a mall early one morning to see what shops were still in business there. It was still early enough for none of the stores to be open, so it was mostly senior citizens there getting their morning walk in. Anyway, what stood out was this one guy. He was in his early 20's, he was barefoot, just jeans and a t shirt but was wearing some of the thickest glasses I had ever seen. He had to be every bit of a -20.00 myope. I got to thinking about how screwed he would be if he lost or broke his glasses, but imagine how much more helpless he would be if it happened when he was barefoot. Trying to grope around a strange environment when your barefoot would be pretty hard if you couldn't see the ground or what you were stepping on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2007, 12:38</p><p>Phil - now, do you mean you *always* wear these -4s in the dark, or that you *only* wear them in the dark? Symantics I know, the beauty of the English language ... </p><p>But come on, I'm no adviser on spectacle wear, it's taken me 15 years to find the first pair that I actually like!!  Good luck.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>OttO</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2007, 09:42</p><p>Interesting observation ehpc.  As a middle-ager with trifocals I can identify with that.  I automatically adjust my distance to the reading material.  What I really notice, however, is that when I'm in a book shop, grocery store, museum, etc, first I'll zero in on something with my intermediate or distance lenses, and then I find myself backing off or moving in closer to focus on what I'm looking at.  Something I never had to do when I was younger.  As far as I can figure, it must mean that my accomodation is about down to zilch!  Fortunately, I don't think about it much.  I just do it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2007, 05:25</p><p>Share prices are difficult in The Daily Telegraph too...............but what really foxes middle-aged eyesight, in my experience, is MAPS, which I obviously use a lot travelling around doing concerts and recordings.Maps really are designed to fox middle-aged eyesight as much as possible - if you can read the letters that say ENGLAND you can't read the letters that say Nether Wallop or whatever, and the other way round. The road numbers e.g. B7031 are another size again....etc etc etc..........it is a business of permanently bringing the map nearer one's face and then putting it further away......and then nearer..............etc etc etc......And then you get to the city, take out the A to Z, and the whole process starts all over again...........................</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2007, 03:28</p><p>Not yet Clare. I've been rather busy at work. </p><p> </p><p>The cheapo -4s now give me exactly the same correction as my -3.75 varifocals. And I've taken to wearing them in the dark!! So I don't think I'm in need of much of an increase in my minus rx this time. </p><p> </p><p>But I'll be pressing for an increased add. I test the reading portion on the fractions in the share prices in the Standard! And an extra .25 or .5 makes all the difference. That's a good test for anyone who may think presbyopia's setting in! Try reading those tiny figures with the minus specs on. If you can't focus it's add time!! </p><p> </p><p>Any ideas on frames? Wouldn't it be a hoot if you could come along as my adviser?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>aviator -oo-</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2007, 15:08</p><p>Fran: don't give up, it's not so complicated! In some countries (China, for example) you can buy ready made up glasses with minus values of between -1 and -6, in just the same way that you can buy reading glasses. OK, so if you're not visiting that part of the world it will be a bit more involved, but not too much. Regarding contact lenses, you could always start by asking your optician for some non-prescription cosmetic lenses, simply to change the colour of your eyes (for fun). That way you will get measured for them (actually, there are only a few different sizes) and get shown how to put them in. After that, you could order some prescription lenses on-line (lots of people on this site have discussed this in the COG thread). Forging a precsription is really very easy, I could e-mail you such a thing I and when you are ready. Have you ever been able to wear someone else's glasses for a reasonable period of time?  If you do not need glasses, that could give you a feeling for what  power of lens your eyes are able to  'accommodate'.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fran</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2007, 09:25</p><p>I'm from Ireland. I don't get the whole forge thing. And how would I get a pair of contacts? My only hope is to fail the test.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>aviator -oo-</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2007, 16:08</p><p>Fran: my advice would depend on which country you are living in. In the first place however, I would suggest playing it straight in the eye exam - if you are not prescibed glasses, I would then think about forging a prescription and going to another optician saying that you needed to order a spare pair or something. I can provide further advice on how to forge a prescription if you need me to: a as a graphic designer, I have forged several using my DTP software. Also, you might like to think about what level of script you would like to have. If you want medium to high powered lenses (say over -3), then a contact lenses / glasses combination would be advisable, however if lower powered lenses appeal as a way of starting, then you could just go for a -1 to -2 script which you should be able to handle without compensation from contact lenses. Let me know if I can help some more.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2007, 00:19</p><p>Fritz, thanks for telling about the high-minus sightings. They are rare, and great! It's interesting how very high minus Rx's seem to cause the person to need to hold things close to see, even when corrected with glasses. Maybe it's because there is so much minification with an Rx in the high teens.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2007, 12:41</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes -- -18 is great and so rare. I think I saw a -16/-18 recently in the local USPO.  Older guy around 50 who probably was once pretty good-looking in a clean-cut way but somewhat gone to seed.  I'd noticed him before with his very thick glasses not only because the lenses were so strong but he also held paperwork quite close to his eyes.  He just got new glasses with much smaller frames and clearly stronger lenses since they're just as thick as the old ones and, I believe, slightly biconcave.  Still holds things pretty close to his face.  Also saw a guy in the market also around 50 who had really small oval glasses with the left lens at approx. -15 and the right at least a -18.  Kind of sexy in a conventional way and rather friendly.  Shame they opened up another checkout and offered the first place in it to me.  Normally a good thing but not this time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2007, 14:40</p><p>-18D? Wow, that's so amazing! I am just beginning to plan a trip to Asia. I wonder if there are really as many high myopes as I hear.  -18D is hard to contemplate. How did the guy look in his glasses? How thick were they? Did you ask him if he ever tried contacts?  </p><p> </p><p>I like your idea about spotting glasses guys... but that would only work for guys who work in public places. Most of the guys I see are working out at the gym, shopping, at restaurants, etc., at random times. It's a great idea though! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jo</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2007, 02:41</p><p>Any one who happens to be in Singapore should check out this guy who's working at the HOMEFIX store (note there are 2 HOMEFIXES. This guy is in the one that's selling mainly drills and heavier duty equipments) in the Alexandra IKEA building. Chatted with him and he mentioned his glasses are about -18D sphere with 5D of cylinder. Thick black frames and even thicker lenses. Not very tall, but still decent looking. Early twenties. </p><p> </p><p>Just wondering, maybe we should have a thread to post about specific places where we can spot cute guys in thick glasses. So anyone who happens to be in that country could make a trip down to spot the cutie and perhaps even make it a part of the travel itinerary for OOs like us.... just a thot.</p><p></p><hr>

But, this past Saturday at a Russian Easter Bazaar, I spotted a good-looking young man--somewhere in his 20', short blond hair, fairly husky built, maybe 6' or close to it, with beautiful completely rimless glasses with high minus lenses. I would guess at least -10 and probably closer to -15.  There were lots of power rings and sparkling reflection of the lights in the room, and the edges of the lenses were neatly and smoothly beveled. And his eyes were somewhat minified.  Unfortunately, I was with my partner and not in a comfortable position to speak to him, but I do hope to run into him again one day soon.  A real turn on!</p><p></p><hr>

I feel self-consciously nerdy with my glasses on, even though glasses exactly like mine are a big turn-on when I see them on other guys. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ellaniele</b>&nbsp;02 Feb 2007, 12:52</p><p>Today I met a guy I've been talking on the internet for some time. I was very pleased to see him wearing nice rectangular glasses (around-4). It was double cool, because when I saw him on webcam there was no sign of glasses. Actually he looked really embarrassed that he was wearing his spex (contacts wearer!) and when we were sitting in a cafe he took them off and put them in his pocket. I was very disappointed for a couple of minutes but then he started squinting hard! Well, all I have to say is that I'm deffinitely meeting this guy again. And again *smirks*</p><p></p><hr>

I thought to myself "how cute" and "don't I know that guy?" I dismissed that encounter as just a nice random sighting and thought nothing of it since I had just talked to him a couple of weeks ago and there were no signs of glasses or contacts.  </p><p>Well over the past two weeks the wind has really kicked into high gear and I saw him yesterday and today wearing his specs, needless to say, I was very pleased. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2007, 10:33</p><p>More intersting, but still nobody modelling them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2007, 18:51</p><p>Royboy: all I get with that link is an order form - no model at all. </p><p>As for Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling didn't write the front cover and never says in any of the books that Harry is a myope. Certainly he sees badly without his glasses...when they're broken in Knockturn Alley he hold the broken pieces up to his eyes to see where he's going...he puts them on to open Christmas presents...on the other hand he sees something moving in the grounds (dog? cat?) without them but need them to see what it is. He could equally have hyperopia or a lot of astigmatism. I agree about the plano glasses in the films, though some of us thought they were low plus in the last one.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>royboy</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2007, 15:30</p><p>hey guys any of u seen the pix of that HOT cutie-pie asian boi on O4L site wearing semi-rimless harry potters. check it out: <a href="http://optical4less.com/index.cgi?sec=fGkL6nJt7kxnZu6UmuKmfe8JPPuw5R&amp;mode=loaditem&amp;id=hr034;" target="_blank">http://optical4less.com/index.cgi?sec=fGkL6nJt7kxnZu6UmuKmfe8JPPuw5R&amp;mode;=loaditem&amp;id;=hr034;</a>  </p><p>talkin about harry potters --- according to the original book cover pictures he had very strong myopic lenses --- at leas' -15. an in the movie he wears those wimpy substitute spex --- plano lenses? !!! it takes away from his total personality and character. hollywood faux!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2007, 15:35</p><p>OK Julian, good advice.  It does seem like these dream "glasses guys" are never interested in me (or are about to have Lasik, or just had it, or ......)  At this point, I'm just enjoying the view. If more comes out of it, that will be wonderful. Of course I'll tell him he looks good in glasses if I get the chance. Maybe I'll wear glasses too ... but most guys are not into that, you know! He's probably no exception.  Thanks! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2007, 18:23</p><p>Tinyeyes: as you say he might be getign ready for LASIK; on the other hand he might have an infection, or even just need to give his eyes a break. Two suggestions: First, the next time you see him, TELL HIM HE LOOKS GOOD IN GLASSES, whether he's actually wearing them at the time or not. Secondly, go to the gym wearing your own glasses instead of the contacts I'll bet you were wearing. That way you might give him the same kind of treat he's giving you. And the best of luck (which you don't always seem to have!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tineyes</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2007, 21:07</p><p>Well, I saw him again today. And he was wearing the glasses again! (I hope he's not getting ready to have lasik or something). </p><p> </p><p>This time, we were in the locker room. He chatted with me as he got undressed to take a shower.  I was just getting there to start my workout. He walked away, wearing only a towel and glasses.  He would have been pretty handicapped without them getting to the shower.  Once again, I was hoping to catch him again before he left, but I never saw him. I can't get enough of the guy! By the way, I was mistaken last night about his eyes....they're big and BROWN. Not blue. Oops!  Either color would look great on the guy; he's very handsome. I also got a good look at the lenses in his spex, which were sticking out behind his frames. They were falling down on his nose again, too. NICE....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2007, 18:36</p><p>Oh I love that "sheepish" look contact lens wearing men get when they're wearing the old specarooni's.  Like they've been caught with their hands in the cookie jar.   </p><p> </p><p>Of course it all depends on the darling man.  A good looking/darling acting guy who never wears them suddenly showing up in extremely strong glasses is unbelievably, undeniably gorgeous! </p><p> </p><p>Oh, swoon. </p><p> </p><p>Let's go a bit further.  A guy who always wears contacts showing up in a pair of noticably powerful older, out of date glasses because that's all he has is even going to be more sheepish.  But, boys and girls, hold on to yourselves, because he gets extra points if the prescription in said specs is not strong enough and he's squinting like mad.  Oh yeah. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2007, 09:01</p><p>tinyeyes - he sounds incredible. I always assume that people don't have glasses unless I have seen them - it is amazing when they just turn up wearing them. A guy at my college (a year above me but a lot younger!) turned up a couple of weeks ago with strong looking flat fronted, plastic rimmed glasses, looking a bit sheepish. He only stayed for about 5 minutes, and I haven't seen him wearing them since. I hadn't really noticed him before, but now I'm fascinated - I want to get a better look!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2007, 08:10</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tiny Eyes -  Wow!  Great sighting.  I think I'd go to pieces as well.  I had a similar experience last month where I work out.  A prep dreamboat about 34 years of age with a terrific body was coming out of the shower looking myopically lost.  Well, lo and behold, he went to his robe and fished outulled a pair of gorgeous gunmetal-color rectangulars which had lenses that were a baby-step away from being flat-fronted.  They were high-index and not especially thick but had loads of power rings.  So hot, especially when his face became more animated when he put them on.  So straight.  I'd love to be his g/f.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2007, 22:07</p><p>Those of you who have "known" me here for a while already know this, but for some reason, nothing gets me more excited than finding out a guy who I didn't think wore glasses, actually has a very strong prescription -- when they show up wearing glasses instead of their contacts. Somehow it's much more exciting than a full-time glasses wearer to me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2007, 22:04</p><p>I've posted stuff like this on here before, but it happened again so here goes. There's this cute guy at the gym, who I've been seeing for at least a year and exchanging glances with. He's really cute: early 30s, dark hair on the longer side which looks great, short cropped beard, fair skin (Caucasian) and nice toned build.  Oh yeah, and big blue eyes, which were distorted and tiny behind powerful minus glasses today for the first time! I already thought the guy was cute, but this was just too much.  We've kind of said hi in passing before, but tonight he actually introduced himself (maybe it was the look on my face when I saw him in the glasses).  We chatted a bit. I was going to be bold and give him my card before I left (even though I'm not sure how interested he is), but I couldn't find him again. The guy is cute without glasses (in contacts, I now realize), but with glasses....WOW!  They are rectangular brownish plastic and around -8. They kept slipping and he kept pushing them up in that "I almost always wear my contacts" way. So adorable... and SEXY. My heart was POUNDING....I'm so hopeless with this fetish, it's ridiculous.  Plus, I found out he lives in my neighborhood, too. I hope to see him again very soon!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2007, 18:30</p><p>OMG!!!!  Henry from Accounting on "Ugly Betty!"  Yum...yum...triple yum! Love the horn rims.  The first scene he was in weeks ago the lenses were fairly strong minus.  Now they seem to be plano. </p><p> </p><p>Was that for effect?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2007, 15:36</p><p>Ok, now I'm having one of those experiences that makes me wonder just how much my OO runs the rest of my life. Usually my preference is for shortish myopes and I generaly have a "thing" against red hair on men, but... Do you remember in the "Revenge of the Nerds" movies, there was this tall, redheaded guy (which one, you ask? Why, of course, the one with the glas- oh, wait, I forgot what movie we're talking about here, guess I have to be a bit more specific!) with strong plus glasses who was still pretty blind? Lately I can't get him out of my head!!! What on earth is wrong with me- he's not my type at all! But I think it's just so unusual (read:exotic) to see a young guy in strong plusses, especially one who obviously can't see well anyway, that I'm intrigued. Plus, a big part of my OO (along with the "helplessness aspect", a sense of something in common, and the "Ooooh, shiny things!" attraction) is the whole "geek-chic", cute nerd thing. Definately there's an attraction to intellegence (smart people are usualy more fun to talk to, plus they can come in handy if your computer crashes!), but I even find the sort of awkward, socially inept quality endearing. Sort of a cross between amusing and touching (amuching?). </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2007, 15:35</p><p>My favorite MIG's of all time: </p><p> </p><p>1.All the real-life Guys in Glasses I've had the good fortune to know-especially my very first crush, the oh-how-hyperopic Jeff J. (in 4th grade he was a dream with blond hair, a killer smile, and BIG blue eyes and I bet he's really a knock-out now), and "my darling myope" Michael F., a dark-haired Italian cutie with the prettiest long-lashed brown eyes that just happened to have more myopia than his moderately strong specs could correct, so that he was an exeptional squinter, he broke my heart in middle school by falling for the Most Popular Girl in School and is no doubt even more myopic now 8-).  </p><p>2.All the four-eyed fellas in the "Revenge of the Nerds" movies-most were either plano or quite low minus, I think, though there were so many, it was hard to decide who to "focus on" (no pun intended). But the one who at present has captured my imagination in particular is Poindexter, the redhead with strong plus lenses who still appeared to have poor vision even with them. </p><p>3. Buddy Holly-a healthy dose of minus in My Favorite Frames of All Time, plus a lot of fun, upbeat music, plus he was incredably cute. </p><p>4. Roy Orbison-good strong plusses and in the dark lenses, cool and hypnotically mysterious, plus great songwriting ability and a voice to die for. </p><p>5. John Lennon-his trademark round gold frames and decent minus lenses (I've always heard they were around my rx (-4), but those are some powerful power rings in some shots (I wonder if mine really look like that?)) only add to his legend status. </p><p>6.That  "I'm with the Network" guy (formerly the "Can you hear me now?" guy?) from the Verizon wireless TV ads-decidedly minus,and once again, I gotta love those black plastic frames. </p><p>7. Dr. Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler) from "Criminal Minds"-not a load of minus, but enough,my favorite frames again and I also love how he often removes and fiddles with them, giving a good (and, I'd wager, genuine) myopic squint now and then. </p><p>8. Matt Damon's character in the new movie "The Good Shepard"-I've only seen promos for this one, but those look like plus lenses in a nice kind of black plastic/half-rimless frame, just in the promos I've already spotted several juicy shots. </p><p>9. Scobo from "Big Day"-not technically an MIG, but more like an MINOG (Man in Need of Glasses), in the first episode of the show someone drank his contacts and he's been stumbling around bare-eyed every Tuesday night since, don't know if the guy who plays him is a real myope, but I enjoy watching his character cope. </p><p>10.Henry From Accounting from "Ugly Betty"-not sure if there's any script in those lenses, but love the frames and the ongoing intriuge between he and Betty, nothing like a nice spexy couple. </p><p>11. Adam from the Science Channel (I think) show "Mythbusters"- once again, a moderate minus in black plastic frames (did I mention I like those? 8-) ).   </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2007, 20:24</p><p>Julian, my link to Jason's blog is long gone and I'm having trouble finding it. Maybe if I go back in the Eyescene archives I can find it. I have some photos, but they are not posted online. Maybe I could post on one of the guysglasses groups. I have a photo of Jason in contacts only, though. Your sighting sounds fantastic, by the way!

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2007, 07:21</p><p>This morning I took a diabetic friend to Out-Patients for laser treatment on her eyes, and sat in the cafeteria doing some paperwork. At one point I looked up and saw a young guy sitting at a table nearby with, I guess, his mother. He had fairish hair under a baseball cap, a red football shirt and, obviously even at that distance, very strong minus glasses. After a while I passed closer to their table and saw that they were in fact myodisks in quite a wide oblong black frame (wire? carbon fibre?) so that the circle of correction was well off centre in the frame. Later I went to the eye clinic waiting room to look for my friend and he was waiting to be seen there. It occurred to me he might normally be a contact wearer who'd been ordered into glasses before seeing the ophthalmologist, and/or he might be a candidate for surgery - not LASIK with his Rx, but maybe implants. Anyway, tinyeyes, having read your last post just before I left home, it occurred to me that even if you didn't like him you'd definitely like his glasses! </p><p>Secondly, I don't remember this Jason. Can you point me to a photo? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2007, 21:51</p><p>I was looking through some old images and found some of Jason, a guy who some of us on eyescene obsessed about a while back (maybe 3 or 4 years ago). He was the young architecture graduate student who let it be known on his blog that he was a myope in the mid-teens. Has anyone followed him? I would still love to see a picture of him in his glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

He was great looking and he was wearing such thich glasses, well for me they were thick enough.  We chatted and I told him that I think have the same perscription.  I was wearing my contacts.  When I told him this I asked him if I could see them... He handed them to me.  Wowo... I noticed too that because his glasses were so thick he even removed the nose peices becaue he said that they were more comfortable that way.  I asked him what his percription was and he said around -7.5.  Anyways I GOT HIS EMAIL.  YAY!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sam12744</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2006, 07:10</p><p>Bit of a Sam's jotting,rather than Julian's,this one! </p><p>In Waitrose this morning,when I was caused to go quite weak at the knees by the sight of a very attractive,slim guy in his mid-twenties,wearing brown trainers,blue jeans and a nice black reefer jacket,open over a trendy longitudinally-striped scarf.His good looks and short black hair were complemented by a stunning(well to me,anyway)pair of black plastic fashion-framed glasses(Gucci or similar),which suited him well and had lovely thick lenses,with lots of cut-in.His eyes were minified most attractively and,given that they were almost certainly high-index,I estimate his prescription must be at least minus 8 or 9.Certainly the lenses would be around 8-9mm thick at the edges. </p><p>After completing my shopping,I had the bonus,as I drove off,of seeing him again,feeding the ducks on the adjacent canal.I have never noticed him before in 20 months of living here,but I really hope I shall see him again in the future.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tineyes</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2006, 20:44</p><p>It is a big jump, isn't it? But I think it's mainly to deal with the spectacle blur because I wear contacts most of the time. The frames are black rectangular plastic, and the lenses are 1.67 high index. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2006, 12:19</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes - That's a pretty big jump at 39.  What kind of lenses and frames did you get?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2006, 23:29</p><p>My new glasses arrived today, the first in about 4 years. I wear contacts most of the time, and my prescription is fairly steady, but I wasn't seeing well with glasses and needed a bump in the prescription. So I'm up to -9.25 in glasses, about a diopter above my contacts. That diopter makes a big difference, especially when I put the glasses on just after taking my hard RGP contacts out. They distort my eyes and I think that's partly why the extra power in the glasses has become necessary. At age 39, it's my highest RX ever...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2006, 23:45</p><p>I saw a good looking, younger (mid 20s) guy today, who looked like he was half Asian/half Caucasian, with really nice glasses on. He was quite nearsighted, probably around -8, and unlike the norm these days, he DIDN'T go for the high-index option, so his lenses were quite thick. They looked awesome with nice polished edges around a quarter inch thick. A nice reminder of what all high myopes used to wear before the advent of high index. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lurking</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2006, 13:49</p><p>There was a couple in my group of friends in college. Jenny and Mark had been dating since I met them. Mark wore glasses and his rx had to have been at least -12, probably closer to -15 or -16. I think a good deal of it might have been astigmatism. Mark had a bad habbit of Jenny catching him staring at other attractive women. Not that he would have cheated on her, but he really liked to stare. One time at an outdoor party she caught him craning his neck at a couple of girls walking by. Jenny didn't throw a fit or get mad, she just casually snatched his glasses and walked over to talk with some other people she knew. Mark was pretty much screwed the rest of the night because he couldn't see a thing. The rest of us got a chuckle out of it, especially when he had to ask some of us to help him find her. When he got to her she cut him off before he could get a word out and said "Don't even bother asking because you're not getting them back until we get home." The walk home must have been a real treat because it was really dark and he had to hold onto her arm as they left.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2006, 12:37</p><p>Oh Katy, Another great memory is this: One guy I dated who wore contacts picked me up for a date once wearing his glasses.  When I opened the door, the first thing he did was shyly adjust the glasses and say, "Sorry about the glasses.  I was having trouble with my lenses today...and...". </p><p> </p><p>This was the first time I'd seen him in his glasses and was absolutely thrilled.  Cute, cute, cute.  I told him he looked great, that the frames really suited him.  "Good choice!" I said. This was circa 1985-86 and they were kind of tortise-y schoolboy frames with gold arms.  I think he was the only farsighted boy I ever dated.  He had big brown eyes and those lenses made them look like liquid chocolate.   </p><p> </p><p>Over dinner that night he took them off once to clean them.  I asked what brand they were and he handed them to me saying, "It's probably written somewhere on the frame.  I can't see to read without them." </p><p> </p><p>I nearly died.  The thing about being a woman who has a "thing" for guys who wear glasses is we are soooooooo easily amused!   </p><p> </p><p>I wear my own glasses once in a blue moon, but I find that when I do, people always want to discuss their own vision/glasses/contacts.  This has led to several men outing themselves as contact wearers as well.  Interesting.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2006, 11:10</p><p>Wayne, </p><p> </p><p>That was the thing with my friend Jake, the guy who only put his glasses on once inside the lecture - that he coped without them TOTALLY defied logic. I mean either he was some kind of medical anomaly or had coping mechanisms beyond normal people's understanding. I was actually being conservative when I said -9.....his glasses were obviously hi-index but had ENDLESS power rings, and even with the special materials, were noticeably thick at the edges.  </p><p> </p><p>Because he mostly wore contacts, he was obviously one of those guys (like me) who just never wore glasses full time, and as a result, never fully got over the initial self consciousness hurdle and was, in a way, perpetually trapped in it. One thing about him, though, was once the glasses went on in the morning, he DID keep them on all day.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2006, 02:34</p><p>VFL - you are right about that ruffled-up, first thing in the morning look. I love men with just glasses and a dressing gown on - the fact that they have put their glasses on first thing in the morning, and the way they look so laid back but completely sexy at the same time - they haven't had to put any effort into it :-)  </p><p> </p><p>I haven't seen anyone hold their glasses up to see the alarm clock, but I would like to! My boyfriend tends to lean very close to it and then squint. I remember with the ex that I was talking about, his alarm clock was a couple of metres away on a shelf or sometimes on the fireplace (student rooms - no bedside tables) - he used to ask me if I could see _where_ it was, then he would go and hold it up to look at it :-)  </p><p> </p><p>Wayne - talking of trying to read without your glasses on reminds me of a guy I used to know, about 45 and -5 or 6 - I think he was avoiding bifocals, because he used to lift his glasses to read small print, and hold the paper really close. He would only do it for a couple of seconds at a time, as though he was shy about it, but I loved the way it showed exactly how far he could see without his glasses :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2006, 22:16</p><p>James, (continuing): </p><p> </p><p>I agree about the "double vulnerability" of a chubby guy with glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I also love guys who are attempting to manage without strong glasses.  The attempt to avoid anyone noticing that he can't see.  The squints and myopic stares.  Surreptitiously leaning close to see something.   </p><p> </p><p>I do tend to doubt that the -9 guy could have recognized you at that distance. Even a -6 would have some difficulty unless he squinted hard. Possibly, he recognized your voice?  I also think anyone -5 and over would not be able to read without holding a book uncomfortably close to his face.  It can be fun to watch him try %-) </p><p> </p><p>A couple of other things I like.  Watching a nearsighted guy try on frames.  Find a frame, take your glasses off and put on the frame.  Lean close to the mirror to see how they look.  Put glasses back on to look for another possibility, etc. </p><p> </p><p>Finally, contacts -- the kind you can sleep in.  On the one hand, don't see the guy wearing glasses most of the time.  But one day a week he will have to wear glasses to rest his eyes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2006, 21:59</p><p>James, loved your posts about guys and situations that are a turn.  I agree most all of them. </p><p> </p><p>I think in the case of Blacks, working class guys and jocks it's a question of a cultural desire to appear strong or tough and masculine.  Glasses add a nice sense of vulnerability to this tough pose. </p><p> </p><p>I recently saw a young Black man walking down the outdoor 16th St. Mall in Denver exhibiting typical hip hop dress and mannerisms.  He was wearing fairly strong minus lenses -5 or -6 perched on the end of his nose like reading glasses.  When he wanted to see something, he'd raise his head to look through the glasses.  I've seen this before and I think it's a combination of wanting people to see his eyes without minification and cut-ins and giving the appearance of not being dependent on them (although he actually was).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2006, 21:39</p><p>Nice sighting this afternoon.  At a McDonald's restaurant I was served by a very nice looking young man who looked to be around 20 years old.  Medium build and quite handsome. </p><p> </p><p>And, of course, glasses.  Very interesting glasses.  A wrap around wireless semi-retangular frame.  Very strong looking plus lenses with a lot of cylinder in them. </p><p> </p><p>I'm better at guessing Rx in minus lenses, but these looked significantly strong -- somewhat thick and thick edges showing on the inner side of the lenses.  A lot of distortion looking through the lenses.  With the additional amount of cylinder I doubt that he could see much without the glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RBK</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2006, 14:16</p><p>MMMMMMMM I have always had a fantasy of a preppyish, jokish, tall, very myopic man wearing basketball shorts and glasses, nothing else..... Do you think that since the weather is getting colder we might get to see more 4 eyed men?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2006, 13:48</p><p>Eustace,  I agree with you on the guys shaving with their glasses on.  Let's expand that to wearing nothing but a towel, a smile and their glasses.   </p><p> </p><p>I've been with several very nearsighted guys and never knew of any of them to shower with their specs on.  But that reminds me of another thing I like.  How about in the winter when a bespectacled guy comes in from the cold and his specs steam up?  The glasses come off before the coat, hat and muffler.  It's very endearing.   </p><p> </p><p>I have always been very good at spotting contact lenses.  But I never mentioned it when I was just getting to know a guy.  I always waited for the "by the way, did you know that I wear contacts?" conversation.  That was always fun. </p><p> </p><p>Love, love, love guys who wear glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MET</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2006, 11:56</p><p>Met a guy one time at a bar.  He was trying to break into the music industry.  He played keyboards.  Didn't know he was wearing contacts until I saw him another time.  He told me his contacts were bothering him and he couldn't see very well with them on.  I instantly became curious about his glasses, but wouldn't dare ask much about it.  One time he had his friend drive because he said his contacts weren't giving him correct vision.  I recommended he see an eye doctor and he said he had been there.  He told me his precription was very high and the optician didn't have his rx in stock so he chose to take something less just to get by.  Now this became more an more exciting.  He picked me up one night for a formal party his work was throwing for the holidays.  This took place in the late 80's.  He showed up at my doorstep wearing round very thick glasses.  I was in heaven the rest of night.  It was interesting to see him take off his glasses when we were sitting at a table.  He gave me a blank stare.  This was before hi index, so his glasses looked extra thick. He told me he'd been wearing glasses since he was very young. Towards the end of the night, he asked whether I had ever kissed "a guy who wore glasses."  Obviously very self conscious of his glasses.  After that he got his correct contacts and I rarely saw him in glasses again. The relationship didn't last long, he had a lot of hang ups and I couldn't deal with them.  So, we parted ways.  </p><p></p><hr>

How about the guys who wear contacts nearly all the time, but on certain weekend mornings don their glasses?

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2006, 14:23</p><p>VFL - Too right, thank God for myopic men :-) You must have chosen your boyfriends more carefully than I did. I tended to go out with someone, and hope they had glasses, rather than checking first! I love that thing where you are in a guy's house for the first time and you are scanning all the surfaces for a glasses case, and the thrill of it if you see one. The ones that didn't have glasses, I persuaded to visit the opticians, and quite often they got a small prescription - but that didn't compare to the ones that had worn glasses for years and had a 'real' rx.  </p><p> </p><p>My most memorable ex had glasses that must have been around -7 or 8 - I can work that out now but at the time I didn't have a clue about guessing rxs. He wore contacts about half the time - there didn't seem to be any pattern to it so you never knew when you would see him in glasses. He had small frames and the lenses weren't that thick but they had tons of power rings - must have been high index. We were at uni at the time and he was studying physics.. I would love to see how strong his glasses are now :-)  </p><p> </p><p>Your guy with the tortoiseshell frames sounds nice :-) My boyfriend got new glasses a few months ago and they are quite a bit thicker than his old ones - a combination of an increase in rx and normal index lenses - they are about 7mm at the edge. He wears them happily, knowing how I feel about them - I think having an OO for a partner can change your attitude :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2006, 10:58</p><p> </p><p>Another recollection: Our home has a back yard with a gentle slope going downhill.  Once, at a dnner party where we had all had a bit too much to drink, several of us lay on the gound and rolled to the bottom of the hill several times.  One myopic guest by the name of Ben took his glasses off before rolling and left them on a ledge at the top of the garden.  My partner, who is also quite myopic, exchanged his own glasses for Ben's.  When Ben came to the top of the hill to fetch his glasses and unknowingly put on my partner's glasses, he gasped that something had happened to his eyes as his vision was distorted.  He thought that he had injured his eyes in the frivolities.  I suppose it was a rather cruel joke and my partner soon exchanged glasses with Ben, who took it all with good spirit.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2006, 10:48</p><p> </p><p>James'recollections are wonderful--and are helping me to trigger some recollections of my own. </p><p> </p><p>1. Years ago, my partner and I had a very attractive and myopic friend who had just moved from Rumania.  He was visiting our apartment once and asked if he could take a nap before we went out to dinner.  When he woke up, he could not find his glasses and went into an absolute panic.  I found them for him in the bathroom, exactly where he had taken them off, and I gently placed them on his face. </p><p> </p><p>2. Taking a guy's glasses off his nose and/or putting them on his nose is, in itself, a turn-on for me.  I once had a roommate who never cleaned his glasses.  They were often visably dirty and smudged.  I used to take them off, clean them, and put them back on his nose!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;21 Oct 2006, 17:07</p><p>Dear Katy, </p><p> </p><p>Yes indeedy they all had glasses like that except for one.  (And he had no glasses at all!)  </p><p> </p><p>You know what I always liked?  When my boyfriends would get new glasses.  The anticipation was so great!  It was almost like getting a whole new boyfriend!   </p><p> </p><p>One guy I went with wore contact lenses exclusively and the first time I saw him in glasses I nearly fainted with desire!  They were brand-new squarish tortiseshell frames and the lenses were so thick they stuck out on the front and tbe backs. He hated them and was embarrassed with how the lenses looked, but I was secretly thrilled. </p><p> </p><p>He took them back to the optician and had the edges of the lenses polished, which didn't make a whole lot of difference.  This was back in the late 70's/early 80's so high-index lenses weren't available yet. </p><p> </p><p>I used to pray for "having trouble with the contacts" days.     </p><p> </p><p>My mom is the only person who ever asked about my only going out with guys who wore glasses.  It was when I was in high school and I nearly died of embarrassment.  You should have been there when I looked at her and said:  "Really?  I never noticed."   </p><p> </p><p>Like hell I never noticed.   </p><p> </p><p>Thank God for myopic men.   </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;21 Oct 2006, 12:03</p><p>Part 2 </p><p> </p><p>4. Chubby, slightly overweight guys. I know this sounds completely contradictory given 3.) above, but fetishes unfortunately don't conform to logic. Definitely don't have an obesity or bear fetish (that I'm aware of), but love a soft-at-the-edges guy, preferably prematurely balding too. I am seriously not kidding here. One of my most enduring sightings (enduring viz the memories in my head, not my relationship with him, we met once) was Danny, a chubby guy with receding hairline. Now when I read that back, he sounds awful. But believe me when I say he was FABULOUS - monstrously thick glasses, constantly rubbing the corners of his eyes, and his weight gave him this extra layer of vulnerability that made him doubly endearing. </p><p> </p><p>5. The nerd/geek archetype. Obviously too many to mention. What I have noticed is that many so called nerds/geeks' glasses are disappointingly weak, contrary to the stereotype. </p><p> </p><p>6. The guy who SO needs to wear his glasses all the time but doesn't. Had a friend Jake a few years ago, mostly wore contacts (and a swimmer with the body to match), but sometimes came to varsity (what we called university for short) in glasses. Except that he actually wasn't wearing glasses. He couldn't have been less than -9, and yet would only put on the glasses when he sat down (in the front row of course). To this day I am not sure how he functioned at all, and yet, he would say hi from quite a few metres away without his glasses, which I also can't understand (lucky guess). Another guy I tutored, must've been around -8 or more. NEVER wore his glasses until he sat down. So myopic was he that he had to put on his glasses TO READ! This should surely have tipped him off to the fact that he should've been a full time wearer like 5 diopters earlier. But some are always in denial. And that is also hot, in its own way. </p><p> </p><p>7. Guys on motorbikes. Have actually seen more of these over the years than one might expect. Also a turnon is the taking the glasses off (a turnon in general, but even more pronounced here) to put on/take off the helmet. </p><p> </p><p>I could go on forever, but pretty sure I've run out of space. Anyone else want to elaborate on some of their favourite types? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;21 Oct 2006, 12:02</p><p>Was recently meditating (ok, FANTASISING, my fetish is totally closeted) about some of my favourite guys over the years, and discerned from them a certain "patterns" or man-in-glasses" that I could NEVER get enough of. Here are some of them. </p><p> </p><p>1. Black/mixed race guys in strong minus. I realise this is not very politically correct of me, but, well, neither is having a fetish in general. </p><p> </p><p>2. What Eustace referred to as the "blue collar" types. These are more common than one might imagine, and undoubtedly the strongest minus I have ever seen (I would guess about -18) were on rather a rough looking heavy goods delivery guy wearing overalls. 2 of my other favourites are a weekend security guy at my local market (AND he is mixed race - double whammy) and a cashier at another supermarket (YES, I am a supermarket whore, they are a GREAT place for sightings in Cape Town, nowhere else compares for sheer volume alone) </p><p> </p><p>3. Jocks/athletes. Unfortunately have only ever known one bona fide Greek god who wore strong minus. When I say strong, -6 or so is the very minimum for guys to pass muster and make me look twice. So for me, this one is more fantasy than personal experience. I know they are out there somewhere but either they're a) they're permanently in contacts b) I'm going to the gym at the wrong time or c) I'm just going to the wrong gym (the one tinyeyes frequents sounds GREAT for sightings) </p><p> </p><p>To Be Continued </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2006, 08:44</p><p>Yes, I thought he should have been able to see his glasses too.. -17s would have been great :-) But I was impressed that they used real lenses, and ones as strong as that - usually film-makers have no idea about prescriptions. There is a shot of the glasses on the floor, with the arms minified through the lenses, as if to show how strong they are :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2006, 06:13</p><p>Excellent film.  My only complaint is that it's unrealistic for a -8/-10 to not be able to find his glasses right next to him on a clear light-coloured floor.  I popped in my GOC combo to see if it would be possible with -17, and if you're panicked enough I can see it being possible.  So, they should have had him wearing stronger glasses :)   </p><p> </p><p>But OO-criticisms aside, a very excellent film - suspenseful, great cinematography.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eustace</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2006, 09:44</p><p> </p><p>In recent years, I have had several very young myopic employees. One of them wore glasses fulltime. For two or three years, two of them were too vain to wear their glasses, but they finally gave in and became fulltime wearers.  The fourth (a gorgeous  "to die for" 22 year old hunk -- 6-4, about 170 or so pounds) is still a hold out.  He squints when I point something out across the room, and he sits very close to his computer screen.  I have seen him wearing glasses only once:  He spent the night in my home (alas, in the guest room).  The next morning I went into his room to rouse him.  He was lying in bed looking at the World Cup on television, and I finally saw them--a beautiful pair of almost rimless specatacles with a thin black frame at the top.  He was never more beautiful!  He quickly took his glasses off.  I have not seen them on his face since that morning (only in a glasses case on his desk), but the wonderful memory of that fleeting glace remains--and I keep hoping . . . </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2006, 07:20</p><p>So, for those of you remember, have an update on "my" guy, the one I am somewhat unhealthily infatuated with at university. this term, which started a week and a half ago, he has been exclusively in contacts, and without the appearance of discomfort I noticed last term. which leads me to believ he might have had some kind of eye infection or something before. This is not TOO much of a tragedy, as I know the contacts are THERE, and it'll make it all the more special when the glasses make their next appearance. </p><p> </p><p>The interesting thing is this: now that I've had the chance to scrutinise him in contacts, he definitely has what is unmistakably a "lazy" eye, his left one is a bit turned in, not hugely, buin enough to notice in the sense that his 2 eyes don't really "match". So for those of you with a knowledge of this or who have prism correction yourselves, how exactly might this work? because it was always my understanding that if one had this problem, contacts were a no-go. And yet, for all intents and purposes, he seems to see really well with the contacts, even better than with the glasses. </p><p> </p><p>anyone able to enlighten me? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>neal</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2006, 16:41</p><p>i'm going to the eye-doc tomorrow, and I'm really curious how it's gonna turn out. I'm 23 and have -1,75 left and -1,00 right with a bit of Astigmatism. </p><p>I've had glasses since I was 16, right now I can pretty much say I wear 'em fulltime, even with my low prescription things are blurry without glasses (especially on my weaker eye) and my eyes feel so much more relaxed when I wear glasses. I wouldn't mind if my prescription would have gone up a bit, it pretty muched stayed stable the last years but when I look at posters with one eye seperately, smaller scripts that I once read without problems turn a bit blurry too... well, maybe that's a little increase, looking forward somehow to the exam!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2006, 07:30</p><p>Another gym sighting: I saw two guys working out together (maybe late 20s in age?) Both were wearing glasses.. one was Asian and his glasses were around -4. The other, cuter one was of indeterminate race (part Asian I think?), taller, stocky build with very short hair and glasses about twice as strong as his friend's (minus RX of course.)  Almost as soon as I spotted them nearby I heard the high minus guy say "I hate working out in glasses!" (I guess he normally wears contacts.) His friend just kind of shrugged. As I watched them, he kept constantly adjusting  his glasses, like every 30 seconds. His glasses were cute, high index with small dark plastic frames, but I could see that they were a little small and the earpieces weren't quite reaching over his ears. A bad fit for him.  I felt bad for him, but watching him struggle with his glasses was a turn-on! He was quite hunky, yet he seemed very vulnerable constantly adjusting his strong-prescription glasses so he could see. For one of the exercises (bench press) he just gave up and took off the glasses, but when he would get up he would immediately pop the spex back on and peer into the distance. He was obviously very accustomed to wearing contacts. So cute!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2006, 22:36</p><p>Wow, that's interesting. I'm usually expecting a guy with a strong minus RX to be the bookish, educated type, so I tend to find that type of guy sexy.  But I guess I can see how the tradesman type guy with strong glasses could be very sexy too. It's even more unusual so perhaps that's why it seems so exciting to you!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2006, 06:17</p><p>Ok, so here's a question for all you lovers of men in glasses: </p><p>are any of you insanely, disproportionately turned on by guys with strong glasses who are clearly tradespeople of some kind, e.g. plumbers, builders, or work in lower level jobs such as supermarket cashiers, as opposed to working in some more high brow or academic endeavour (e.g. doctors, lawyers, professors)? </p><p> </p><p>I find that I certainly am, not exactly sure why though. Just went and did some grocery shopping and one of the packers (guy who puts the stuff you've bought in plastic bags) had a very strong prescription, AT LEAST -10, and yet from his job, accent and diction, it was clear that he was not well educated or a student, ie this is his fulltime job. </p><p> </p><p> So maybe, part of the turnon is that these guys are evn MORE vulnerable somehow (definitely part of my fetish), cos they don't have the "excuse" or justification (for the normal, non-glasses loving world) of being "bookish" or somehow academic, the whole glasses going with educated intelligence stereotype thing</p><p></p><hr>

He says he counts how many it is from the end, before he takes his glasses off, and remembers. He squints a lot without his glasses, though, which makes me think maybe the one you saw had a higher rx than -6 - or maybe it works for some &amp; not others.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2006, 20:55</p><p>I had a gym-shower sighting tonight for anyone who cares to hear. I was working out and saw a late 20s-ish Asian guy working out, kinda cute but not great. I probably wouldn't have noticed him except for his really nice high minus glasses: wire-rims, high index and maybe -6 or -7.     </p><p> </p><p>Later, I went to go take my shower, and there he was in the shower stall across from me, without glasses of course. Without glasses he didn't even bother to look around -- he just concentrated on his shower, and his eyes were closed much of the time with water streaming down his face. It didn't seem as though he had brought his glasses with him to the shower, so I waited to see what would happen next. I went out to get dressed, and soon after, he went to his locker. No squinting -- it's useless as his RX level. I noticed that he had chosen an upper row locker rather than a lower -- that way, he could walk right up to the lock and dial his combination at eye level, just a few inches away. With a lower locker he would have had to stoop very close to see the combo. Once the locker was open, you guessed it, he popped on his glasses IMMEDIATELY and looked around and up at the TV. Very cute!  He continued drying off, getting ready, in the nude except for his strong glasses. Very cute to watch!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2006, 07:31</p><p>Glasseslover, </p><p> </p><p>I am 26. Think I have always had a thing for guys in glasses, but only "isolated" it properly in 1996. I was in the equivalent of the tenth grade (for you Americans) and had this teacher who wore really big ugly plastic framed glasses (outdated even for the mid 90's). Anyway, one day we were reading in our setwork (it was Afrikaans.....puke) and there was a reference to one of the characters in the book fixing his broken glasses with chewing gum, so blind was he. At this point, in translating the paragraph, the teacher (who was mid thirties and had a definite teddy bear look about him, and had a moustache) remarked how he was so blind without his glasses, he would have to do the same or similar placed in the same situation. </p><p> </p><p>I conveniently developed problems with the course and asked the teacher if he could tutor me after class a few afternoons(it was a provate school where such things were expected of the faculty). After one session, I made some LAME comment about him never taking his glasses off, to which he launched into a brief history, saying how he had worn glasses since the age of 3, only had minimal vision in one eye.....and then through some blurred conspiracy of events in which I still cannot remember clearly JUST what he said, he took them off and I tried them off. Needless to say, I couldn't see anything. </p><p> </p><p>I sometimes reflect on that day as the moment that really crystallised my fetish for me. Apologies for the indelicate detail, but was hard as a rock after, and had to go to the bathroom as was all "sticky" without having touched myself AT ALL (a little too much info, I know). Also, the day is significant in my memory, as I had never done anything so brazen or audacious before that, and never have since (someday......) </p><p> </p><p>In retrospect, his probably weren't the first glasses to turn me on, but were the first I was AWARE of being turned on by. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>al</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2006, 05:22</p><p>Hey James </p><p> </p><p>Your postings are such a turn-on.

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;09 Sep 2006, 16:07</p><p>James - I had a similar sighting of a guy at the gym a couple of years ago. I usually wear my glasses in the sauna -- not that I couldn't manage without them, but the better to see the other guys.  A young man came in wearing quite strong small wire-rim glasses (-10 or so).  Later I saw him enter the shower still wearing his glasses.  He then carefully placed the glasses in a soap tray, leaning very close as he did this. </p><p> </p><p>DNBursky -  A few years ago I was sitting on the beach and noticed a nice looking guy wearing fairly strong glasses (-6ish).  He took his glasses off and went into the water.  When he returned he hadn't remembered where his blanket was and did a bit of peering around and squinting furiously before he found his place.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doreen</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2006, 07:42</p><p>As my summer job this year I am working at the same company I have worked at the past two summers, but only for a month. One of the guys who had been wearing contact lenses all the time last year now seems to wear glasses only. I have seen him during the year in glasses once and he told me he had an eye infection, but ever since then when I came for a visit he was wearing glasses and looks absolutely gorgeous. I even fancied him last year before I knew he had contacts and even more after he once casually mentioned it. He said he had undergone some treatment against an allergy and could not wear contacts for three years. He is in his mid-twenties, has dark blond hair, short and spiky and his glasses are black plastic. Maybe I get the chance to ask him why he's not in contacts anymore. He know I have contacts so there's some common ground. Unfortunately he has a girlfriend ;-( </p><p> </p><p>I have seen another colleague in glasses today, but only caught a glimpse of him in glasses since he only put them on when he got into the car and I was already in my car on my way home. I was surprised because his work involves a lot of computer related tasks and I have never seen him in glasses at work.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2006, 18:31</p><p>Welcome James. Yes, I have seen older guys who swim with glasses. I mean senior citizens (post 70 years old) who do that type of thing. One thing I asked a lot about this summer with friends who wore glasses is if they take them off at the beach how they find their way back. They said they always make sure a friend is nearby. </p><p> </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2006, 17:58</p><p>I over heard my supervisor speaking to a couple people one day about getting lasik surgery.  His doctor said he would be a good candidate for it, and he went on to say how nice it would be to see things in the shower in the morning, like shampoo.  He wears a pair of very high index glasses with metal rectanglar frames.  I'd guess he's a -7.  Anyway, my first thought was, I wonder what he'll do with his glasses once he dosen't need them anymore.  It's a shame to have them go to waste in some drawer when someone else could be enjoying wearing them.  I wonder how weird it would be to ask if he would consider selling them.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2006, 12:24</p><p>It is quite amazing how glasses can really tip the scales in a guy's favour. This morning at the gym there was a guy who, in an ordinary world, I would not have given a second glance. There was nothing WRONG with him....he was a LITTLE on the old side, but that's not a bad thing as a RULE, and he was in good shape. But what really turned it around was that he wore glasses....rimless, but strong enough that he felt dependant enough on them to wear them into the sauna AND the shower. That is quite an unusual occurrence, at least at my gym. Even guys with stronger prescriptions tend to remove the glasses for showering purposes. But this guy didn't. And then, what made it even better was that he took them off in the shower (now don't think me a blatant stalker, I was able to observe all of this within a split second), and started washing them at the same time as washing himself. </p><p> </p><p>While this was going on, he gave that blank stare into the distance I love so much....to me it always indicates a prescription above a certain minimum threshold. The blankness of the stare usually tells of a script where reflexive squinting would useless. </p><p> </p><p>Anyone else seen anything like this at the gym (or public pool, or something similar)?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2006, 19:47</p><p> </p><p>My this thread is getting more interesting!  The last several postings have been a real turn-on for me.  (And welcome, James!  Your posting was great!) I guess I can get into the hunk who wears contacts, squints, etc.; but what really turns me on more are guys (hunks or not) who are extremely myopic, do not wear contacts (for whatever reason), and are totally helpless without their glasses.  Better still, guys who almost never take their glasses off, except to go to sleep (and even then only after turning out the light). I get off on fantasizing guys who shave, shower, swim, make love, and have sex wearing very thick minus lenses (preferably bi-focals or tri-focals, and/or prisms).  Recently, I have become fascinated by learning that some guys (who have posted) actually  regularly sleep with their glasses on.  And what could be more exciting than one guy are two guys together!  I assume that all of you are familiar with the websites that have some wonderful "men in glasses" stories--such as Electra's and the Yahoo Group.  If not, let me know and I will provide the URL's.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2006, 02:00</p><p>Tiny Eyes </p><p>You are probably right. Although, him shaving WITH his glasses on (but nothing else on, of course), is an equal turnon.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2006, 14:22</p><p>James -- It's great to hear from you after  lurking so long! Would love to hear more. The guy sounds awesome! I know what you mean about the dramatic difference when someone who wears very powerful glasses in in contacts. It changes their look completely. Also, I love it when I can tell a guy's contacts are bothering him.  </p><p>By the way, from the sound of it, your school friend probably wouldn't be able to shave without his glasses on, so I don't know if you'd ever get to witness that, unless you hid his glasses from him! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2006, 12:31</p><p>Apologies for the typos, and on my first ever post too! But I DID put in the disclaimer of how "distracted" this man makes me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2006, 12:28</p><p>Hi there, </p><p>like many I am a LONG time lurker on this board, and by long, I mean LOOOONG. Don't really like the word lurker as it has a stigma attached....in my case just never felt I had anything worthy of posting. Until recently that is. </p><p> </p><p>I'm a law student at the University of Cape Town (UCT) and this semester (which starts in August in the Southern Hemisphere), a new American guy arrived on some kind of masters exchange. I love him. I am breathless even trying to write about him, my heart is pounding at the thought, and it's impossible to write impartially. </p><p> </p><p>Definitely a high prescription and he wears a black plastic frame, sort of somewhere between oval and rectangular. I am not an expert at guesstimating but I'd say somewhere between -9 and -11. And to me, the plastic frame seems like an unusual choice for a high prescription, unless I'm wrong on this (please set me straight if I am). Anyway, one of the indicators that the script is strong is that the lenses stick out past what is QUITE a chunky frame already. Other surefire signs are the power rings and the cut in, which is probably about a quarter of the lens on each side. </p><p> </p><p>Never spoken to him properly although I keep trying to find opportunities to. I do somewhat stalk him in what I think is a subtle way but in reality probably is anything BUT subtle. He's hard to describe in a way that does him justice. Short dark hair, always clean shaven (obviously imagining him shaving with/without glasses is one of MANY turnons), kind of geeky but in that cool/geeky way, if that makes any sense....?  </p><p> </p><p>In the computer labs he mostly sits a normalish distance from the screen, but can fairly often be seen peering in closer. Now comes the thing that really gets me going, maybe it will others too (kind of a reverse version of what Tiny Eyes is saying)....once a week, always on a Friday, he wears contacts. Not sure what the significance of this day is or why it is only once a week, but he just looks like SUCH a different person then, because his black plastic glasses are quite imposing and a definite feature of his face and impossible to miss. What I particularly love about the contacts is that you can totally tell he is not comfortable in them and not used to them. The eyes are kinds red, there is a lot of blinking going on, and on one particular Friday, saw him first in contacts and later in the day, back in glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, sorry to have rambled on and bored you all. About myself: after years of overcorrecting, I am only a -3.00 and -2.75 myope (and probably not even REALLY that) who ALWAYS contacts. Funny that, when glasses can be such a turnon on others....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2006, 11:26</p><p>tinyeyes/Eustace- My room mate at college just got bi-focals earlier this summer.He says he is around -9.5 and has ft-35 bi's.His doc said he should have had them a year ago or more and now he has +1.75 for reading and is a close reader like me.I will try to talk him into tri-focals like mine.For me anyway its a turn-on to see his face with these specs.My glasses are too strong for him.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2006, 10:03</p><p>For me, it's the strong minus glasses that are a big turn-on, and if bifocals and trifocals are part of that, it's great but not necessary. I'm with Wayne on the strong, masculine thing. A big, strong hunky guy who was weak eyes is a huge turn-on. I also find it even more arousing when a guy who is very nearsighted conceals it with contacts most of the time. When he eventually reveals the hidden weakness, wearing the strong glasses that are (hopefully) thick, and even if not thick, are strong and make his eyes look very small -- that's so hot!  I'm a -9 and I want to wake up in the morning with a guy who is as blind as me (or worse) until he reaches for his glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;01 Sep 2006, 22:38</p><p>For me, anyway, the appeal is vulnerability.  Seeing a strong, masculine guy with strong glasses really turns me on -- although any good looking guy wearing strong glasses will turn me on. </p><p> </p><p>I also like it when a guy attempts to disguise the vulnerability -- trying to manage without glasses or wearing dark rx sunglasses, etc. so as not to appear "weak".  I remember a young guy in my church with maybe a -6 rx who always wore a baseball cap with the brim down so his glasses weren't as visible.  Once he got contacts, he never wore the cap.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;30 Aug 2006, 19:32</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Picking up on a recent post of Julian's, as well as several others-- to various threads:  I find it psychologically fascinating that many of us (myself included)seem to be enthusiastically encouraging others to progress to trifocals!  For me, most exciting (in this order) are: stong minus (-8 to -20), then bifocals, then trifocals, and finally prisms.  I do wonder what accounts for this attraction?  Any thoughts on this?   Perhaps I am overstating things--or perhaps there is just no explantion for such attractions. What do others out there think? </p><p> </p><p>Eustace </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;29 Aug 2006, 07:30</p><p>DNBursky/David, I like your party story. I have been discovering glasses in other people's houses like that for years! Earlier this year I went to a large party and went into the guest bathroom. On the counter there was an open bag with an eyeglass case and contact paraphernalia. OF course I took a peek and inside was a pair of rather thick, very powerful minus glasses -- definitely over -10. Obviously they belonged to a contact-wearing houseguest. I never did figure out who it was because there seemed to be more than one guy staying there (in addition to the host, but they definitely didn't belong to the host.) A mystery!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;21 Aug 2006, 16:27</p><p>Hope everyone's summer's going well. I a few tales to tell of different summer weekends. </p><p> </p><p>In July was a local gay film festival. I met a friend of a friend, nice guy, never suspected he wore contacts. I saw him again a few days later in glasses which looked really weak. He's a built guy, but more of a little football player build. I said he looked good in glasses. We talked online yesterday after a long period where I couldn't reach him due to my having a wrong email address of his. So I ask him his prescription. He said he was -1. and -1.25 I was surprised. I said why do you have contacts and glasses when your prescription is so weak? He said he noticed a difference. I guess I was surprised as was he when I told him that I am -4.5 </p><p> </p><p>Another interesting summer weekend day was spent at a BBQ/pool party at a friend's house. I had to use the restroom and I see a pair of glasses laying next to a dop kit with contacts boxes in it. At first I was unsure who's glasses they were as there were three guests who visited my friend. The contacts said -5. and -4. on the box. I went downstairs and back out to the porch and remarked that "I was surprised someone had so much stuff in their overnight bag". One guy who was visiting said it was another guy's as his travel bag was the other one I saw which wasn't a dop kit. I never did get a chance to ask the guy about his eyesight though.  </p><p> </p><p>I'll keep being on the lookout for guys with glasses. :)  </p><p> </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

He argues that with those films it is easier to change them over the time as my eyes gets better, (I hope so). The lenses have very tine row of saw lines and they gives me a peculiar appearance. Apart from that, they are almost Ok. </p><p> </p><p>Hope you understand my English. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2006, 15:11</p><p>Eustace </p><p> </p><p>1.67 is the index of refraction of my lenses - high index. CR39 is 1.50 (1.498) low- index and thick. mid-index is 1.54 to 1.60 a bit thinner. indexes above are considered high and thinner yet. i think there are some glass lenses that go as high as 1.8 and 1.9. I think you could say the higher the index the thinner the lens.  </p><p> </p><p>I went right from bifocals to progressives. Had no trouble adapting. </p><p> </p><p>I started sleeping in my glasses while in high school when visiting friends overnight. I felt safer knowing where they were. Started wearing them in the shower around the same time. I have, on occasion, had them fall off during the night but fortunately havent rolled over on them. The only time they are off my face is when I am cleaning them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2006, 11:25</p><p> </p><p>-14 </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for the information.  I think I understand your Rx, except for the 1.67.  What does that mean?  Did you try trifocals before you went to progressives?  When I first became presbyopic, I had progressives.  But later I switched to trifocals--just because they are (or were back then--and I assume still are) so much less expensive.  How do you keep your specs from falling off during sleep?  Do you shower with your glasses on? </p><p> </p><p>Eustace</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2006, 15:22</p><p>Brian 16 - My RX is -14.75/-14.50 +3.00 progressives with 11BO. The lenses are 1.67 so hi-index is available for prisms. The outer edges are 11mm. </p><p> </p><p>Stuart - Like Brian, I'd like to know where you purchased your swimming goggles? </p><p> </p><p>Eustace - I'm one of those guys who sleep in their glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2006, 11:03</p><p>Eustace-Yes,I can confirm he has base out prisms (2.0d).He still has just bi-focals but they too are increasing in rx.He sees very well-better than even my friend.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2006, 07:23</p><p> </p><p>Stuart: </p><p> </p><p>Rx in the mid-20s!  Wow!  That is pretty awesome! </p><p> </p><p>I would love to learn more about you and your vision:  How old are you, and how old were you when you first began wearing glasses?  Do you wear bifocals or trifocals or prisms?  Do you have a diagnosis--other than just being nearsighted (plus perhaps astigmatism)?Is there a family history of vision problems?  And I would love to know how thick your lenses are--say in comparison with Brian-16's? </p><p> </p><p>I got my first pair of glasses at 13 and have been wearing trifocals for some years now.  My Rx is so much weaker than yours and Brian's that I am really embarrassed to tell you what it is.  Nevertheless, I feel blind and totally helpless and disoriented without them.  Indeed, I never take them off, except to sleep.  I shave, shower, swim (and make love)with them on.  (I have read some posts from guys who say they sleep with their glasses on!)  I even put my glasses on if I have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, in the dark.  I have roundish wire frames with wraparound ear cables--becuase I like the snug, secure feeling that this gives.  </p><p> </p><p>I just cannot imagine what your and Brian's vision must be like without glasses.  How many inches past your eyes does your vision begin to blur without your specs?  </p><p> </p><p>Anything you are willing to share would be appreciated. </p><p> </p><p>Eustace</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2006, 07:00</p><p>Brian-16 </p><p> </p><p>Also I meant to ask you about your little brother (who is probably not so little anymore).  Has his Rx been increasing, and does he now have trifocals and/or prisms also?  (I'm interested in the hereditary factors in poor eyesight.) </p><p> </p><p>Enjoy the sun and swimming with your secure glasses guards! </p><p> </p><p>Eustace</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2006, 04:41</p><p>Stuart-I was wondering where you purchased the swimming goggles.My rx is less than yours and I do not have perfect vision at all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stuart</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2006, 23:30</p><p>Eustace, Brian -16 </p><p> </p><p>Re swimming I have finally invested in a pair of swimming goggles - and they are great(although the vision they provide is far from perfect nor is it with glasses).

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2006, 16:27</p><p>Eustace-Well I do strap them on very well on my head.I am studying Communications (Radio and TV and film). </p><p>I am quite content with my specs I have now and things appear more natural but due to the high rx somewhat smaller.My friends vision is not quite as bad as mine but does have bi-focals.He does have 20/20 so he is a help to me at times.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eus</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2006, 12:57</p><p> </p><p>Brian-16: </p><p> </p><p>Thanks so much for your prompt reply.  As long as you can see OK, what does the thickness matter?  In one of your posts you mentioned that you were looking forward to a relaxed summer in the sun.  I was just wondering:  Do you wear your glasses when swimming? If so, how to you guard against losing them in the water--especially in the ocean?  (I hate swimming bare-eyed!)  Do you use a "glasses guard" around your head--as I do?  By the way, have you decided on a major in college? </p><p> </p><p>Eustace </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2006, 06:09</p><p>Eustace-The lenses are about 12 mm or about half and inch at the temples-the thickest point.But they taper in and are thinner toward the nose.I believe they are CR-39 material.I really like them as thick as they are.As I think I mentioned in an earlier post they are not full correction.Although I do not get 20/20 or 6/6 with full correction anyway.So for now I am relaxing my eyes somewhat and it does not bother me that I miss a couple of lines on the chart.Driving is no problem either.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sam12744</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2006, 00:39</p><p>That should have read "principle"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sam12744</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2006, 00:36</p><p>Eustace, </p><p>You are not entirely correct about prism lenses not being available in high index,but you are not entirely wrong either! One can have them made in any high index material and that will reduce the overall thickness,because it reduces the thickness of the sphere part of the script.What it will not do ,is reduce the thickness caused by the prisms.Thus,my real rx glasses,by way of example(I sometimes do GOC,but the same principal applies,of course),are less than 2mm thick at the inner edges with reasonably high index material,but thicken to 11mm at the outer edges,because of the 11 base out prisms.Goodness knows how thick they would be in CR39,but a higher index material than I opted for would reduce the outer edge thickness only a little more,because the prisms override the relatively modest sphere of -4.25. </p><p>I hope that makes some kind of sense! </p><p>Sam</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2006, 20:41</p><p> </p><p>Brian-16: </p><p> </p><p>It was good hearing from you after such a long time.  (I also read your posts to "Post Your Prescription.")  I would be curious to know the thickness of your new lenses (in either inches or millimeters).  Could you post the thicknes, both in the center of the lenses and on the outer edges?  (Am I correct that prism lenses cannot be made in high index?) </p><p> </p><p>Eustace</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2006, 00:54</p><p>Tinyeyes: </p><p>If you are ever in the UK you should go to the market in Birmingham. On one of the West Indian veg. stalls there is a guy who must be at least -30. I last saw him a couple of years ago (I've been abroad since) but I expect he's still there!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2006, 23:33</p><p>Sighting at the gym tonight:  I saw a very muscular black guy, with very dark skin and close cropped hair, wearing thick high minus glasses -- probably around -9 or -10.  He wasn't young -- probably in his mid 40s at least -- but he looked great in those glasses.  He actually said hi to me (maybe because I couldn't keep from looking at his glasses) and I ended up working in on a set with him. But I think he was straight. His glasses were oval wire rims, high index I'm sure, but with thick polished edges, and deep cut-in with nice power rings.  Very sexy! I have very rarely seen black guys with such a strong nearsighted prescription. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2006, 19:59</p><p>Hmmm...good question.  My own vision isn't that bad without glasses or contacts.  Well, I wouldn't want to go without them, but no, I don't have a high prescription.  If I did...who knows?  It's all a crapshoot whether we get the "bug" or not.  I think that we are a very select little group.  It's a very individualized thing.   </p><p> </p><p>I think that two oo's meeting "naturally" and not by say, the internet would be a very rare thing indeed.  If the internet had been around when I was single, I have no idea where I would be today.  It's probably best that nature just took it's course.  I really don't think that (and I can only speak for myself) the glasses thing can be forced.  That wouldn't do "it" for me.  You know? </p><p> </p><p>But as my grandmother used to say, "Men are like lightbulbs, all you have to do is flip a switch...women are like irons...they take a while to warm up."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SZ6</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2006, 19:11</p><p>A question for the women who like guys with strong prescriptions. Do you ever wonder, if you had a strong prescription yourself, you would still be into thick-lensed guys? </p><p> </p><p>Just curious--I have a high prescription, and I'm also one of those guys who's into girls with thick glasses. Obviously, years of bad vision didn't make me shy about discussing my eyesight and glasses--in fact, I think my own bad sight might have contributed to my fetish!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2006, 19:00</p><p>No Sophie...you are definitely not the only one.  Isn't it a relief when you find out you aren't?   </p><p> </p><p>It's been my experience that the men with the strongest prescriptions are the ones that have been the most "scarred".  Sometimes it's best not to force the issue with them.  I've been close to two men with very significant rx's and both did not want to talk about their eyesight at all except when one ended up without either his contacts or glasses on a trip and the other just to say that his vision without glasses "sucked" and there is no way he could even walk down the street without them or his contacts.  He too claimed better vision with contacts.  (This was my first husband.)  Once his RGP's were out for the night he was out of commission.  He absolutely could not get a descent eyeglass prescription.  To read anything without correction he had to close one eye and hold whatever it was like five inches away from his nose.  </p><p> </p><p>I loved watching him do that. </p><p> </p><p>Yeah, I thought I was a perv...but, it didn't hurt anybody.  It just goes to show, there is somebody for everybody.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2006, 18:35</p><p>Hi, Sophie! There's no need to be apologetic about your prescription - at 19 you've got plenty of time to get more serious. If you try Gemma's or Emily's techniques I would guess you could easily get up to -10!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2006, 18:30</p><p>Well Sophie, your own prescription is definately moderate, but you still must wear glasses to do much of anything.  It is understandable that your boyfriend would rather wear contacts, as his vision likely is better with contacts.  And, he is probably a little gun shy about wearing glasses, since he has likely had some bad experiences in the past. But, if you were to be able to convince him to wear glasses more, the more he wears glasses, the better he will be able to see with glasses. About all you can do is reinforce your feelings, without revealing too much. Good luck</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sophie</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2006, 18:21</p><p>Hi,  </p><p>I am not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I'll just give it a try. </p><p>I finally decided to post on here after lurking for several weeks. </p><p>I'm 19, female, German and during the last few months I've come to realize that I've always been attracted to men wearing glasses. Of course, there are also men without glasses that I find attractive, but specs make most men just look cuter. (anyone seen the pics of Matt Tong in the "Musicians" thread? Mmmmmmmmmm...) </p><p>I think the first time I really noticed this was while watching Spider-Man for the first time. IMHO, Tobey Maguire- nice looking, but nothing special. Tobey Maguire in glasses- incredibly cute. (Of course, my friends thought I was crazy when I told them) I still wonder if the ones he wore in the movie are real or plano's. </p><p>My own prescription is rather moderate (-4.25 Left eye, -3.50 right eye), but my new boyfriend (we've been dating since the end of march) is around -13 in both eyes. He usually wears contacts (he claims that it is not out of vanity but because he has better vision with them...) </p><p>I was actually thrilled when saw him in glasses for the first time and I thought he looked very cute. I've spent the next weeks wondering if I'm a perv (especially since he said that most people were shocked when they saw him in glasses for the first time), so I was actually kind of relieved when I found this forum and saw that there are more people like me. </p><p>I'm not sure if I should tell my boyfriend about how much his glasses turn me on, especially since he dislikes having such poor eyesight... when he made a remark about how a former girlfriend of his had complained about his glasses, I said that in my opinion, he "looks cute" in them, but I didn't go any further... </p><p> </p><p>-Sophie</p><p></p><hr>

I have not read or posted to any of the Eyescene threads in months; but, in scanning recent postings just tonight, I found nothing from Brian -16.  (I have just been so busy, both socially and professionally.)  I am wondering if Brian -16 ever posts these days? He must have just completed his second (or maybe even third) year in college.  I always enjoyed his postings, beginning I think when he was only 16.  He used to describe taking showers with his boyfriend when they were in high school and had "slept overs"--both of them wearing their glasses in the shower.  (Brian once wrote that, at least, he was assured of having clean lenses once a day!)  As I recall, Brian wore prism tri-focals (and was so happy with them). He had something like a  </p><p>minus 11 or 12 distance Rx.  His boyfriend just wore bifocals.

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2006, 15:03</p><p>Jennifer - it is frightening. There are some good links, especially the Lasik Memorial one, and the pictures under 'Risk' - 'Colour Atlas', of things that have gone wrong are horrific, more so if you read all the captions... 'dislodged folded flap 24 hours after Lasik'...  </p><p> </p><p>What comes across from the people that have damaged vision after surgery is not just the sense of loss, but the fact that the surgery/risk was so unnecessary - wanting to get rid of glasses seems such a trivial thing compared to what they are going through. I hope you persuade him! :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2006, 12:58</p><p>I'm not sure what my wife feels about my wearing glasses, but there are three main reasons why I would not wish to go in for LASIK: </p><p> </p><p>1. The risk of something going wrong - my vision with glasses is extremely good. </p><p>2. I am in my early 40s, and although I do not currently have any problems with my near vision, I know that reading glasses/bifocals will be coming my way in the foreseeable future. </p><p>3. The thought of the surgery itself. </p><p> </p><p>My glasses are roughly -8, and I am used to them.   I know where to find a spare pair for those occasions when I take my contacts out before I have found my glasses, so I have never experienced the feeling of helplessness that goes with not being able to function. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2006, 12:40</p><p>It scared me too!  Fortunately, neither my husband nor I have any intentions of getting Lasik (or Lasix, because you can p**s away money).  We both know our eyes are in too, shall we say, "not good" a condition to try experiments like Lasik. </p><p> </p><p>Of course, we're wildly attracted to each other in our glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2006, 09:48</p><p>Katy: </p><p> </p><p>Thank you!  I will sit my husband down and have him read!  It scared me!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2006, 12:01</p><p>Jennifer - have you shown him any of the websites about unsuccessful surgery, like <a href="http://lasikdisaster.com/" target="_blank">http://lasikdisaster.com/</a> ? How high is his prescription - enough to make it more risky than usual?   </p><p> </p><p>If my boyfriend decided to get Lasik, it would and wouldn't change how I feel about him - of course I wouldn't love him any less, but to me his glasses are a part of his attractiveness, rightly or wrongly. I agree with VFL - I have been out with guys without glasses, but it is never the same, although I have tried to convince myself otherwise. On top of that, the thought of him having unneccesary surgery with the risks involved would be pretty scary. If your husband knew how you felt about it, wouldn't that be enough to put him off? I would be completely open with him, and tell him exactly how you feel.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2006, 16:39</p><p>Jennifer, </p><p> </p><p>Do you think that you have the strength to sit your husband down, look him in the eye and tell him that if he were to get Lasik you understand what it would mean to him, but you want him to know that it would "hurt" you? Really? Could you do that?  What would he say?  Seriously?   </p><p> </p><p>I don't know why I let that person upset me so.  No...really I do know exactly why.  I have never breathed a word to a lover how I felt about their "need" for eyeglasses or contacts.  Somehow it would "spoil" the excitement for me.  There are certain things in life that can't be forced or orchestrated.  They have to happen "naturally".  If a lover or now, my husband were to know of my quirk and "set up" little "moments" they would not have the same effect on me.  It's not a matter of not trusting the people I've been with (and it's not been many), it's been a matter of knowing myself and wanting to keep this part of myself somehow "sacred".  If I "told", it might ruin it somehow and I don't want to give it up.  It's like a secret treasure that only I know of, can take out and play with once in awhile, then put back.  It's sweetly sexy, not in your face. </p><p> </p><p>But that's just me.</p><p></p><hr>

My husband knows that!  Glasses for him do not have the same effect on him that they do on me.  To him, it's not a sexual thing, so I feel it's hard for him to relate to my wants and needs for him to wear his glasses.  Yes, a relationship goes way beyond the sex!  My husband is thinking about freeing himself from having to deal with contacts and glasses.  He sees it as an improvement in his quality of life.  I will try to change his mind in what ever way I can.  I would really like for him to change his mind on his own, like your husband did.   </p><p> </p><p>I was glad to find another woman post on here who feels the same as me.

I mean like -3 or less. I guess sometimes when I IM a friend I feel more comfortable asking him as opposed to asking in person.  </p><p> </p><p>It's always interesting when a reality show has someone with glasses. Example, in the U.S. one of the chefs on the show "Top Chef" wore glasses or contacts. He won, actually, a cutie. Then I was watching the last few episodes of "The Apprentice" and Pepi who was "kicked off" on one of the first weeks tried to help one of the two guys try to win in the 2 part finale. So there's Pepi all of a sudden in high strength lenses. It was cute to see. </p><p> </p><p>For me, I guess I find farsighted guys interesting as it seems rarer to find. I have a moderately farsighted friend in Ottawa, Canada. I've told him about this site, and he's sweet about my interest in the issue.  </p><p> </p><p>I also have a friend with lazy eyes, I am unsure the correct term, but basically his eyes go all over. His lenses have prisms. I met him in NY for Gay Pride NY last June. We caught up when he visited the Philadelphia suburbs this past March or April. I showed him this site from the laptop at the internet cafe where we hung out.  </p><p> </p><p>Locally, I hear of one person or another getting lasik. It frustrates me, but ces la vie.  </p><p> </p><p>Nice to hear from the new people who have been posting. Glad to "meet" the women who post as well. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Loose Cannon</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2006, 00:33</p><p>I'm skeptical: if my SR (spooge receptacle) threatened to get Lasik, I'd do everthing in my power to dissuade them.  I'd tell them how hot they look in specs, point out all the horrible things that can go wrong with Lasik, and how they'll need reading glasses anyway, then as a last resort chain them to the bumper of my truck to stop them from going to the laser clinic.  I mean, it's as stupid as being afraid to tell your lover that you really like it when they do "x" because you're embarassed. If you can't be open about something like that, then it sounds like a pretty superficial relationship.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2006, 17:23</p><p>Any sightings of young Prince Will in his glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2006, 11:56</p><p>Jennifer, </p><p> </p><p>I just told myself that it wasn't my decision, it was his.  The truth is, I can't tell him what to do with his body anymore than he can tell me what to do with mine. </p><p> </p><p>I was devastated.  Truly.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I took a long bath that night and cried.  Now, to most people that would sound so lame.  Crying because your husband wouldn't need glasses anymore?  Most people (or at least normal ones) would be thrilled.  Glasses are a negative thing, right?  Well, only our select little group understands how important glasses can be.  I swore to myself when I was very young that I would only marry a man who wore glasses.  I realized that I "needed" that in my life.  I wouldn't just marry a man for his glasses...but, that would be one of the non-negotiable "criteria" that I would look for in a mate.  I dated men who didn't wear them, but it wasn't the same.  I'll be very frank about that.  Emotionally it was good, but the sexual part was never on the same level.  I was afraid that if my husband had his vision corrected that our sex life would take a major, major hit.  Rightfully or wrongfully, this was my fear.  I felt that I would be losing something very dear to me.  This made me feel sad and very guilty.  Normal people don't have these feelings, do they?  But then, our feelings are our feelings and we have a right to them, don't we? </p><p> </p><p>Even if he had had it done and gotten reading glasses, I don't know if I would have been "satisfied".  I don't know what that makes me.  Shallow?  Imperfect? Human? A head case? There is something very comforting to me to have those beloved eyes looking at me from behind those lenses that are worn full-time.  I like it and I need it.   </p><p> </p><p>Freud would have a field day with me.   </p><p> </p><p>But to get back to your question, Jen, I would have sucked it up.  I love my husband and I would have learned to live with it.  Truly, though, I might have had to have gone into therapy.  I'm not kidding.  It would have hurt me that badly.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2006, 09:21</p><p>VFL, </p><p> </p><p>I'm happy that your husband decided against getting Lasik.  I am now facing the same with my husband, who keeps bringing it up.  He's determined to get it done sooner or later.  I get really upset when he brings it up and don't know what I should do to change his mind. I like him wearing glasses or contacts, but I don't want to over emphasize that.  My greatest concern is the bad outcome that's possible with this type of procedure.  I'd be curious to hear how you handled yourself in this situation.  I've always loved guys in glasses and I don't want to loose mine!  Help!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>still</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2006, 17:10</p><p>Dear VFL, it's refreshing to hear your balanced, humane way of looking at things. Sometimes our fetish makes us a little blind to what's really going on...Keep on posting, I really enjoy reading your thoughts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2006, 16:52</p><p>Jennifer, </p><p> </p><p>I'm right there with you on that.  I hadn't thought of that incident in several years until I "told" it yesterday.  It's like all of a sudden all of this stuff is flooding out of me.  Sorry if I'm being a board "hog".  Anyway, your husband's story sounds like my friend's.  As much as I love guys who wear glasses, I don't want to see them separated from their specs unwillingly.   </p><p> </p><p>Thinking back on that night, it was the first and probably only time I'd seen someone have a true panic attack.  It was painful and frightening for him and quite frankly, scared me.  I wear contacts, but could make do without them or my glasses if I had to.  I really can't relate to literally not being able function or "safe" without some form of correction.  Just remembering it makes me feel bad. There is cute vulnerable, then there is the kind of vulnerable that it's not fair for other people to witness vulnerable. There's a big difference between the two. I just hope that he remembers me as being helpful and non-judgemental.   </p><p> </p><p>Our relationship ended because, well, it just ended.  We weren't well suited to one another for the long run.  Every once in awhile I'll see him around town and we always greet each other warmly.  I guess we'll always share a special bond over that night.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2006, 15:07</p><p>Reading the posts about hiding glasses reminds me of a story my husband told me when he was in high school and in the school gym.  Some of his team mates decided to play a joke on him and swiped his glasses when he was in the shower.  From what he describes it was a horrible experience. It sounded like he was helpless in that situation. He was angry at those that played that joke on him.  He shouted in anger which brought the attention of people that were able to convince those that did the awful deed to give it up.  After hearing that story, it's a game I would never want to play with him.  He's not the type that will take it well.  I don't like the idea of making him vulnerable in that way.  I'm an OO and I have to admit there's something about watching him search for his glasses on his nightstand, but if he accidently knocked them on the floor I would be right there to help him find his glasses.  I couldn't stand to see him suffering in any way.  That's my opinion.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2006, 22:14</p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>I guess if I were reading this as a story that happened to somebody else I'd find it exciting.  But if you had been there, believe me, you would have been freaked out, not turned on.  It's not sexy to see a grown man's hands shake because it scares him to not be able to see. I think it was a lack of control issue.   </p><p> </p><p>We were able to get him an appointment at the Lenscrafters and he had new glasses by noon the next day.  Contacts weren't possible...his prescription was a special order something or other.  The frames he ordered were a squarish tortiseshell.  The lenses were pretty heavy duty (I'd venture a guess...-9 or -10?  High enough that he wouldn't feel safe walking down the street alone without them.  Would that sound right? Maybe it was astigmatism that had him so whacked out.?  I know that mine (which is not that high is what gives me splitting headaches when I try to go without correction for any length of time.) I'm not very good at guessing prescriptions.  Sphere I think I can do, but the cylinder part is a mystery to me.  That's where everything goes all screwy. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2006, 21:56</p><p>Well, VFL, everyone has a different fetish, but I would tend to agree with you that for me, at least, it's all about vulnerability, but not about pain and suffering or true impairment.  I would love to play a game with a guy where I hide his glasses from him or something, but if they were truly lost, that's not any fun. Also, the turnon for me goes away if they really can't see well, even with glasses (i.e. partially blind.) That's not my thing... but I'm sure it's someone else's!   </p><p> </p><p>That said, though, your story is kind of exciting.... it's certainly one you won't ever forget!  How did the attorney look in his new glasses??  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2006, 21:33</p><p>Oh Tinyeyes...I was about to log off and go to bed when I read your tragic, tragic story.  If I went to bed now, I'd surely soak my pillow with bitter, bitter tears.  So, let's stay up and think of better days... </p><p> </p><p>Yeah, the pj stories are the best, aren't they?  One of my greatest contact lens/eyeglass stories is when a my-o-how-myopic lover and I were staying at a very posh Bed and Breakfast for a long weekend...close to 1,000 miles from home.  We'd taken the train to get there.  He wore one day disposable contacts and thought they were the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Well...and I think you can see where this is going...We got ready for bed and he took out his lenses...wrapped them in a piece of toilet paper and flushed them down the old WC...then, he went fishing around in the old Dopp kit for his glasses...which were nowhere to be found. Panic ensues.  He goes through his overnight case.  No glasses.  No extra lenses either.  Then he remembers...he laid the little black case with his glasses and the dailies on the bed and forgot to tuck it into his dopp kit.  So...there he was...1,000 miles from home...no contacts, no glasses and no prescription sunglasses, only plano sunnies.  I really don't know what his prescription was, but it was bad enough that he had what I considered to be enough of an anxiety attack that I had to put him in the whirlpool tub, give him a couple of Tylenol PM and get out the Yellow pages and assure him that there was a Lenscrafters closeby that we could get to first thing in the morning that could do a walk in exam and either fix him up with a pair of specs or contacts by noon the next day.  He kept saying, "You don't understand...I really can't see...This is really bad. I am really screwed."  This was a pretty high powered attorney.  Normally, I think that glasses "moments" are kind of endearing, but this was sad.  I felt really bad for him.  What do you guys think his prescription might have been to have gotten that panicked?  I think that different people have different thresholds of what it is that puts them over the "edge", but I remember bringing him a drink when he was in the tub and his hands were literally shaking.  I knew that it was going to work out okay, but I had a hard time making him believe that.  Afterwards he sent me a huge bouquet thanking me for being so kind and loving when he needed me so much, but it really put me off of my "fetish" for some time.  I don't want to get my jollies from someone else's impairment...you know?  I hate to be a downer, but, this really freaked me out.  We have to help each other through these things... </p><p>We can have fun with our little quirk, but it ceases to be fun when somebody we care about is truly panicking because they're thrust into a big blur and feeling unable to easily get out. </p><p> </p><p>Just my two cents.  I hope this makes sense.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2006, 21:04</p><p>WOW, this is the most activity in one day that I've seen in a LONG time. Bravo! I had no idea how many ladies were lurking here! Now, why don't you guys do some more posting too?   </p><p> </p><p>As for the Lasik thing, I have unfortunately been a victim of it way too much. Actually, even pre-lasik. Years ago (when I was VERY young of course :-) I dated a guy who was about -7 and very cute with thickish wire rim glasses.  YUM!  Then after a few dates he announced he was getting RK (Radial Keratotomy -- the precursor to Lasik.)  Oh no!!!  I was very shy about my fetish then, but I totally lost interest and broke it off. I don't think he ever really knew why. I guess that wasn't fair, but after all, I couldn't ask him not to get the surgery done if he really wanted it.   </p><p> </p><p>And, I have been dating someone for months off and on who had Lasik for his -9 eyes about two years ago, before we met.  It kills me!!  He's a great guy, but I find it hard to commit to someone who did this, because my fetish is so strong.  Frustrating, frustrating. As Julian has said, I tend to have terrible luck.  </p><p> </p><p>All the nightime, bathroom, pajama things you are talking about are SOOOO sexy....  I also love when  a guy who's very myopic is trying to find his glasses, and must lean down very close to (the table, or nightstand or whatever) to find them. SO CUTE!!  I LOVE the vulnerability...  also I love the intimacy of the "reveal" when the contacts guy lets you in on his little secret when he finally sleeps over.  It's just the best....  :-) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2006, 19:42</p><p>Okay...this is my final post of the evening.  The closest I ever had to a nervous breakdown is when my husband came home from work one night and over dinner announced that one of his co-workers had had Lasik and it was a great success...so, he thought that he might like to have it too.   </p><p> </p><p>The thought made me physically ill.  I really couldn't finish my dinner. My beloved chattered on and on and on and on about how his friend could read the clock on the nightstand and see first thing in the morning without glasses...blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...and how he was going to make an appointment with the same doctor...didn't I think that was just great? </p><p> </p><p>Oh yeah...perfect.  Jesus big effing Christ...just tear my heart out of my chest and stomp on it while you're at it, why don't you? </p><p> </p><p>Well, it never came to fruition...my darling was told he'd need reading glasses after the surgery and decided on his own it wasn't worth it...so I ducked that bullet...WHEW! </p><p> </p><p>Anybody else have that experience? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2006, 17:12</p><p>Finally, regarding guys who take their contacts out before getting into to bed with you.  It is fun when they come out of the bathroom wearing strong glasses.  I like it even better when they come out bare-eyed, staring myopically and squinting and leaning close to see things.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2006, 17:05</p><p>Regarding gas permeable contacts.  I wore them off and on for quite a number of years.  The strongest my Rx has been is -6.5-/-7.00.  I much prefer GP's.  They're easier to handle and easier to care for.  It takes a little while to get used to them, but after that I find them as (or more) comfortable than the soft ones. </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, my eyes became very dry a few years ago and I can't tolerate contacts.  I've tried the soft ones and hate them.  They flop around on your finger.  It's hard to tell if they're right side out.  They're very comfortable at first but my dry eyes suck the water out of them very quickly.  I'd like to try another pair of GP's but the popularity of soft lenses has made GP's a lot more expensive -- and no free trials. </p><p> </p><p>I did have a little spectacle blur when I took them out, but it didn't last long.  I often took them out and wore my glasses at home in the evening.  I have no astigmatism, by the way.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2006, 16:56</p><p>Very interesting all this recent activity from women who enjoy guys with glasses.  You're certainly making this thread a lot more active than we gay guys have been lately.  Great sightings too. </p><p> </p><p>I suspect that there are a lot more OO women than we realize.  A number of years ago when I was working in an office in New York there was a guy who wore quite strong minus lenses (-10 or -12, I suspect) in big round plastic frames.  One day he had taken his glasses off for some reason and one of the women there remarked "look, he can't see without the glasses" -- in a way that made it clear she thought that was cute.  Many straight women do appreciate vulnerability in a guy (so do I, especially glasses).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2006, 15:28</p><p>Lazysiow - I would love to see what would happen if a real OO couple got together - both getting turned on by one taking the glasses off the other. That would be interesting... we need an OO dating site :-) </p><p> </p><p>Clare - that is so annoying! Did you ever try to persuade him to wear his glasses when you were together, or to get new ones? :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2006, 15:18</p><p>VFL - I know, it isn't easy to appear calm when things like that happen! I suppose at the time, I would have done anything to stop people finding out about my 'strange glasses thing'. I remember the glasses were big, square and wire-framed, and I'm sure the lenses were quite chunky. I could see power rings from where I was at the side of him, although I didn't know that's what they were called, and I knew they were minus lenses. I would guess -3 or -4, made thicker by the big frames. I love that he came up to the house in what must have been a blur. You are right, he was probably really embarrased, but there was no way I could have said he looked nice without going as red as a beetroot.  </p><p> </p><p>These days it is a different story - I am forever telling my boyfriend how incredibly sexy he is with his (-6) glasses on, off, squinting, cleaning them, etc etc... he loves it that he can have such an effect on me so easily. He just came up to the computer, read the bit about taking someone's glasses off to kiss them, and said 'oh my god you do that all the time!' So there you go :-) </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2006, 14:19</p><p>where are women like you guys? I've never had a girl take off my glasses for a kiss before or put them back on.

<p><b>martin</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2006, 14:16</p><p>i'd say i wear em 60 % of the time. although 1,75 may be quite low compared to other people's prescriptions, everytime I go out without glasses things are blurry, especially in the night when I just can't say if it's the bus who's coming or just any other blurry light... to be exact my left eye's -1,75 and my right is -1,00 with 0,25 of Astigmatism (last test has been one and a half years ago)... </p><p> </p><p>when going out I most of the time put 'em off, but I really think about changing this habit as it's much more relaxing for my eyes when I wear glasses. besides that, it's always funny when you don't greet people because you simply don't recognize them without glasses, and they think you're getting arrogant, and I always argue "hell, sorry I just wasn't wearing my glasses". </p><p>:) </p><p> </p><p>I know this sounds funny to people with stronger prescriptions, but that's the way it is to me. Especially after not having worn my glasses for a day or so, it's so damn relaxing to have 'em on again...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2006, 11:58</p><p>Katy, VFL, can I join in?  My last seriously bespectacled date was a -5 who, in all the 9 months we were together rarely wore anything but contacts during daylight hours. Given that I'd assume he wasn't a fan, but his first introduction to glasses was SO nonchalant, just a "hey you haven't seen me in glasses before have you?". What to say?? His specs weren't so great, roundish gold ones, yet he was gorgeous so it galled me somewhat, after we finished, to bump into him one morning in Starbucks to find him wearing a very sexy pair of rimless that suited him way too much. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2006, 09:50</p><p>Oh Katy! </p><p> </p><p>Okay...let's just be best friends.  Obviously we were cut from the same cloth. </p><p> </p><p>I would have died when he pulled the glasses from his pocket. "Well, I guess I'd better put these on."???????? </p><p>Jesus, God, almighty... You deserve a cookie for keeping your composure.  I wouldn't have known whether to have peed or have gone blind. (So to speak.) </p><p> </p><p>You didn't say anything?  Nothing?  LOL! Now I know this was some time ago, but can you remember if the lenses in those glasses held a prescription of any consequence?  Sounds like your boy either had a fight with his contacts and the contacts won or one decided to make a mad dash for freedom and jumped down the drain!  If you had known him that long and had never seen him in glasses and/or he had never mentioned his contacts the poor thing must have been in a dither wondering whether you'd think he looked like a dork in his specs.  (Little did he know.)  Then, you said nothing.  How that must have messed with his teen-aged, hormonally challenged mind.  "She thinks I'm a dork!!!!!!!!!" he's thinking....while you're dancing around your bedroom with your teddy bear barely able to contain your glee!   </p><p> </p><p>At that age I had the cutest boyfriend...a very handsome blonde with the bluest eyes.  He was not only fun to be with and witty, he was valedictorian of his class... I think he was the first guy who sort of "knew" that I really liked his glasses, because every once in a while, I would slip them off of him, give them a good polishing, then slowly place them back on his nose.   </p><p> </p><p>Oh...Katy...haven't the sweetest kisses of your life been the ones where you have gently lifted the glasses off of your lover's face and sort of held them behind his back while you smooched?   </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2006, 08:44</p><p>Thanks, VFL! :-) They were all real prescriptions - one minus, one with prism, and two plus 'for reading' (both aged around 20)... two went full time, with a bit of encouragement ;-) None were strong rxs though - they couldn't really compare to those who had worn glasses for years, couldn't see without them, and had a whole load of glasses related stories to tell. You are right about the photo albums... it is so sexy to see the whole history of someone's glasses-wearing, especially if the lenses got stronger with each new pair :-) </p><p> </p><p>That day at school... we were sitting in the common room at lunchtime, chatting, and I noticed what I thought was an eyelash in his eye - just a curved line. I was just about to point it out to him when it hit me what it was. I didn't say anything - I always got really embarrassed talking about anything vision-related at that age, and I thought he must be shy about the contacts, otherwise he would have told me about them. As far as I know, he had never been to our school wearing glasses (he moved from another school a couple of years before) - so probably none of his friends knew either. I remember so clearly how I felt afterwards, sitting through a double Physics lesson - nothing was ever the same after that day. It must have hit me what men with glasses could do to me :-) A few weeks later, he had come to pick me up one night - as we got in his car, he pulled his glasses out of his pocket (oh my god) and said "I suppose I'd better put these on". I nearly died, of course, but pretended to take no notice. He took me to his house and wore them all evening - his mum was around so probably he had no choice. I know what you mean - you can look back at all those moments over the years, and you never forget any of them. </p><p> </p><p>Your log-cabin man sounds gorgeous. I love that early morning, ruffled-up, glasses-and-nightwear thing. Whatever it is - pyjamas, dressing gown, or nothing(!) - it is the idea of them putting their glasses on first thing, before they get dressed. Mmmmm... :-)</p><p></p><hr>

Early, early morning.  The sun half way up.  He was in his mid thirties.  Dark blonde.  Hair all mussed up, badly in need of a shave.  Found him out on the deck, mug of coffee in hand, sitting on the deck, dressed in drawstring pj bottoms, a long-sleeved matching t-shirt and a pair of burnished gold framed glasses (which I had never seen before then). When I walked out on the deck and he turned to look at me, I got a dimpled smile that nearly made my coffee "go down the wrong pipe."  He wasn't mine, never was, never would be, but, oh God almighty, the sight of that man with the rising sun reflecting off of those lenses...those dimples, those straight white teeth...just the moment.  It was one of those little film clips I will forever run over and over in my mind. </p><p> </p><p>Well, there isn't any more to say. I've said it all.</p><p></p><hr>

I love your posts, and tinyeyes is right - we need more women on here :-) </p><p> </p><p>When I think back to my old boyfriends, it is always the glasses-related incidents that stand out. I'll never forget the day I realised that my first boyfriend (at school) was wearing contacts - I sat through the rest of the day's lessons in a state of turned-on excitement, unable to think about anything else. And the day my friend Steve at uni turned up for lectures wearing a pair of gorgeous strong glasses (I had never spotted his contacts) - he went from ordinary to incredibly sexy overnight. We went out for a while after that - I didn't find out his prescription (I would now!) but it must have been around -7 or 8.  </p><p> </p><p>You are right about 'you never know if you need glasses' - 4 of my boyfriends had never worn glasses when they met me, but ended up wearing them.. oops! how did that happen? :-) </p><p></p><hr>

Now you've given me a nickname and ask if I "must go."  Well, maybe not yet.   </p><p> </p><p>I'll tell you something else I find cute.  Now that most of the men I've found attractive through the years are getting up there into their 40's, the ones who disappointed me with 20/20 vision are starting to have trouble focusing on their paperwork and complaining of "headaches" and suddenly, thank the Lord above!, pulling reading glasses out of their pockets.  Extra, extra, extra points if their docs have prescribed a distance correction as well and they go from no glasses at all to full time wear virtually over(big-effin'-night)! </p><p>  </p><p>I went out to lunch with a group of clients and one of the men who had just started wearing his glasses full time said, (after one of the women in the group complimented him on the frames), "At first, I thought I'd just wear them in the office, but now I can't do anything without them. The doctor told me this would happen, but I didn't believe him.  Ah, hell, what can you do?" </p><p> </p><p>Poor baby.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2006, 16:24</p><p>tinyeyes, </p><p>One of the advantages of rigid contacts is that they cause astigmatic corneas to conform to the inter surface of the cotnact thus correcting the astigmatism. When you take out the rigid contacts and first put on glasses with cylinder correctiion, the corneas retain the spherical shape for a while and gradually return to their astigmatic shape, which matches the cylinder in the glasses eliminating the intitial blur. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2006, 15:41</p><p>Well Lurker, thanks again for posting and please continue to if you feel like it!  We don't have many women here (do we?) I know there are some, but it seems as though most of the people obsessing about guys in glasses, are other guys... (me included.)   </p><p> </p><p>I feel the same way about gas perms insuating a stronger RX, although it's not always true. It usually means at least a more difficult RX to correct. Anyway, I am a gas perm wearer myself, and at around -8 definitely on the stronger side. However, almost all the guys who I've known with myopia considerably higher than mine (what a pleasure!) were soft lens wearers. As for me, I was always told I would never have clear vision with soft lenses.  </p><p> </p><p>By the way, this is a little off topic, and I may have asked before, but are there any gas perm wearers here who have trouble with spectacle blur (blurred vision with glasses on after removing contacts)? I do, and always have. The eye doctor finally just basically said it is an effect of wearing rigid contact lenses. That is one of the reasons I so seldom wear my glasses, except as backups at home. If I stop wearing my contacts and wear glasses for a couple of days, the effects of the spectacle blur go away. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Very Friendly Lurker</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2006, 11:34</p><p>Tiny Eyes, </p><p> </p><p>Gas Perms tend to "insinuate" a stronger prescription than soft lenses.  (Rightfully or wrongfully so.)  </p><p> </p><p>I am going to stop posting and go back to "lurker" status, but, let me say this...my first husband was so nearsighted that he had to put on his glasses to find the bathroom in the middle of the night and I had to actually "guide" him when he lost both lenses and forgot his back up glasses on an overnight trip once.  Then, years later as a divorcee, I dated a very handsome guy who happened to be blind (white cane, Braille, the whole nine yards).  </p><p> </p><p>Where this fascination with poor vision comes from I don't know, but I've had it all of my life. I don't go around telling people about it. It hadn't hurt anyone...and it's given me a lot of pleasure.  It just goes to show that "there is someone for everyone".   </p><p> </p><p>To all of you guys who need glasses and hate it, I'm sorry if they get in your way and if your vision is a problem, but, please know that there is a woman out there who is very attractive, very intelligent and lots of fun who thinks that you are the cutest and sexiest things walking on the face of the earth.  </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for wearing your glasses (when you do), for taking them off to clean them and squinting those little squints and sometimes when you have them off asking "what time is it?" and all those little things that just come naturally.  I love you all dearly. </p><p> </p><p>Really. </p><p> </p><p>Even if you don't think you need glasses or contacts...go for an eye exam.  You just never know.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2006, 08:34</p><p>Friendly Lurker, I LOVE your sightings and observations. WOW, I am right there with you... my fetish totally extends to contacts and, as I've said on this forum before, NOTHING is more exciting to me than when a contact-wearing guy reveals his myopia by showing up in strong glasses for the first time. Many stories to tell, but my best ever was a number of years ago when I had my first date with (unbespectacled) Mike, and went into his bathroom to discover a super powerful pair of glasses burning a hole into the bathroom counter. Of course I tried them on immediately. I did end up spending that night with MIke, and NOTHING was more exciting than waiting while he was in the bathroom at bedtime, and then emerging from the bathroom transformed with his beautiful coke bottles on -- "firmly" on as you say. Firmly on because there was no way he could have functioned, especially with another person in the room, without them. He was well into the double digits and glasses were oh so necessary even for a 10 foot trip from bathroom to bed. I wear gas permeables myself and I find them even sexier on a guy than soft lenses, for some reason. They seem more like little glasses floating on the eyeball.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Very Friendly Lurker</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2006, 13:56</p><p>Sorry troops...not sharing the old prescripcharooni. Like Goldilocks said of the Three Bears' porridge...Not too hot...not too cold...just right.  I could drive in an emergency if I really, really concentrated, but couldn't read a page of print to save my soul.   </p><p> </p><p>I have lived my life slowly slipping my boyfriend's glasses off and staring deeply into their eyes before giving them those kisses that melt their toes... Sitting in bed, just waiting for those contact wearers to emerge from the bathroom on that "first night" with glasses firmly on... </p><p> </p><p>Who can forget the guys who need to fumble for their glasses from the nightstand to hold them in front of their eyes to read the alarm clock that's right there?  Bonus points for not even unfolding the darned things...just holding them up and taking a look through...now, that is cute.  Oh and the sweet cuties who have to shove the glasses on their faces to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2006, 11:09</p><p>Very Friendly Lurker, </p><p>What's your prescription?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Very Friendly Lurker</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2006, 09:44</p><p>Doreen... </p><p> </p><p>It's probably best not to say anything at all.  Because in the long run we would sound like blathering idiots.   </p><p> </p><p>The only exception I can think of is when I went out for lunch with a guy I have always liked recently.  We sat at a counter at a kind of "funky" local spot.  This meant we were sitting kinda close.  Now, this is a truly platonic friend...we are both married.  But he is adorable and wears glasses as though he was born in them (I have never seen him without them on his nose.)  For some reason, while we were talking, I happened to look at him, and noticed that his lenses were progressives (how is it we notice these things?) While ready to take our order the waitress said she needed to get her glasses.   </p><p> </p><p>Afterwards, I said to him, I wouldn't give up my contacts for reading glasses, so I got the bifocal contacts.  He got all interested in that.  I asked, Do you have a reading add?  And he said, Oh yeah and I swear to God, took his glasses off that second and offered them to me like a present.  I didn't even have to ask.  I wasn't sure what he wanted me to do with them...so I looked through them at the darned reading segment.  I could see why he doesn't take them off. He couldn't find his way out the door without them.  Cute.  Gotta love the little permanent red marks on the sides of a guys nose who wear their specs from morning to night like that as well.  Life is good.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoff</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2006, 03:44</p><p>Rick, maybe we should move this conversation over to "hyperopia and presbyopia progression"?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doreen</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2006, 00:44</p><p>sorry, couple of mistakes, probably because I was so excited after reading about the sighting.Anyway, I meant: I don't think I would..., but who knows? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doreen</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2006, 00:41</p><p>Very Friendly Lurker: I really envy you for this gorgeous sighting. Wish I had been in your place. I wear gas perms myself and I'm always dreaming of sightings like yours, wow! I don't I would have had the courage to talk about glasses either, but who know? Keep posting your great sighting!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Very Friendly Lurker</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2006, 23:10</p><p>Well, the man who was born to wear glasses (in my opinion) finally had to pop those gas perms out of his baby blues for at least a few hours today.  The pollen counts in our area are through the roof...and no amount of rinsing and reinserting was going to make it better. (Darn!)  He showed up in the office looking very sheepish in absolutely adorable dark titanium framed specs.  I suspect they were high index because thin as the lenses were, his eyes were very small behind them.  I was a very good girl..I didn't say a word...even though as a gas perm wearer myself it would have been very appropriate to commiserate. </p><p> </p><p>What is it about a man who never wears glasses and suddenly shows up in such strong ones?  It's like Christmas and New Years all rolled up into one.  An event well worth waiting for.   </p><p> </p><p>Oh...and when they wear them...extra points for taking them off once in awhile...either to rub their eyes or to give the lenses a good cleaning.  Those uncorrected myopic eyes are so adorable...and vulnerable. Automaticaly, you wonder what they can see. So guys, you have no idea what "power" you hold over us.   </p><p> </p><p>That is all for now... </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Very friendly lurker</b>&nbsp;31 May 2006, 21:46</p><p>Hi All! </p><p> </p><p>I've been lurking since the very beginning and thank you so much for your kind, kind support. </p><p> </p><p>I've posted perhaps three times and am now a happy gas perm wearer (that's my thing ands switching back and forth from glasses that I really need...oh joy!)  My dream come true!  There is nothing...absolutely nothing as good as taking out your contacts and looking aroud the room and not being able to read the clock or read the television previews, etc. without going into the other room to get your glasses first.   </p><p> </p><p>I am only sharing this with you...my friends...I tried to leave my contacts out the other night and go out for dinner with my husband for an experiment.  He was driving and I didn't make it halfway there.  All the headlights coming at me were fuzzy blobs, the billboards and street lighs were blobs and my head felt like it was splitig open.  Our came the glasses case and the relief was immediate.  So now,I'm a full time wearer, I don't have a choice.  It's either put in the contacts or the glasses or suffer through a fuzzy world near and far and a headache to boot.   </p><p> </p><p>But, I have found a man who was born to wear glasses...haven't seen him in them...but, at a recent meeting had the pleasure of seeing little gas perms floating about in his baby blues.  So I know there have to be glasses somewhere hidden in a drawer somewhere...God, it drives me crazy to see a man who usually doesn't wear glasses to suddenly show up in them.   </p><p> </p><p>What a great little game...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;31 May 2006, 20:41</p><p>Geoff: </p><p> </p><p>Thanks. The bifocals are fine actually there great. I am very glad I got them. I don't think about them anymore except when working at the pc when the screen is too high for the reading lens so I have to bend my head back a bit. But that doesn't matter. </p><p> </p><p>I like the large reading lens of 35mm bifocals so I'm glad I made that choice. Thanks for the advise on that. I also find the line has trained my eye to be either over or under the line. </p><p> </p><p>I suppose the only problem is the middle ground but I have got use to that.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoff</b>&nbsp;30 May 2006, 16:56</p><p>Rick, how are those bifocals doing for you----still looking good.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;21 May 2006, 00:08</p><p>Really nice sighting tonight -- bartender at a new gay bar in town.  A nice looking very slim young man, probably mid twenties, great smile and very friendly.   </p><p> </p><p>And, of course, he was wearing glasses.  Small, rectangular thin black plastic frames that really suited his face  -- and quite strong lenses, probably -8 or -9.  He looked so cute in them with the noticable cut-ins and minification and glinting as he turned his head. </p><p> </p><p>It's unusual for a young gay man with a strong rx to be wearing glasses -- especially a bartender.  I assume he can't wear contacts.  He's cute enough that it probably doesn't hamper him that much even with those guys who don't have our appreciation of the beauty of those glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

While the success rate is high, there is a risk of complete sight loss and permanent damage to tear ducts and the cornea. </p><p>'Despite the risks, 23-year-old William is reportedly eager to rush into the complicated surgery before Christmas (DEC05) to ensure he is fully recovered before joining Sandhurst military academy in January (06). </p><p>'A royal source says, "William has found out he may have to wear glasses full-time and he's been very keen to explore the possibility of laser eye surgery. </p><p>'"He's gone into hospital and seen a consultant, who's explained how it works and the risks involved. </p><p>'"He knows it's controversial and there are issues with joining the army but he's positive about the idea." </p><p>'23/10/2005 14:15' </p><p>Comment 1: A friend of mine in the Army (who mainly wore contacts before he joined but now wears his glasses most of the time) told me that any applicant who's had LASIK is rejected out of hand as it leaves the eyes too vulnerable. </p><p>Comment 2: What is it with the Royal Family and their eyesight? Surely there's nothing extraordinary in a teenage boy becoming myopic (which the report seems to imply) and needing stronger prescriptions over a few years. I can't believe William went through three years (or was it four) at St Andrews and got a degree without being able to see the board in the lecture hall: he must have worn either glasses or contacts in class, presumably the latter - but why keep it under wraps? The Queen wears glasses in public, bifocals I think, but Peter Phillips (Princess Anne's son) is the only other Royal who is unashamedly bespectacled. I've seen photos of Prince Edward wearing glasses when driving, but what about the rest of them? Anonymous posters quote rumours of Prince Andrew needing bifocals, which at his age is perfectly normal; it would be equally normal for Charles and Anne to need correction for near vision. Do they all use monovision contacts? </p><p>What have they got against specs?</p><p></p><hr>

He caught me looking at him, but it was a great sighting -- his small rectangular wire frames held thick lenses, and his face was deeply cut in behind the lenses. Of course, his dark brown eyes were extremely tiny behind the lenses. His glasses must have been between -10 and -13. Great sighting!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adam</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2006, 13:20</p><p>Hi everyone!  Did anybody see the show "Beauty &amp; the Geek" last Friday? Some of the geeks were pretty damn myopic - Will wearing deliciously thick spex with a lot of cut in, but it was young Edmund who was the real high myope and his spex were really thick, glinted in the light and every now and then slipped down his nose so that you could see his eyes over the tops.  Great sighting!!  The beauties were just ... beautiful and so far no-one has commented on the glasses but we must hope I suppose! </p><p>Cheers all!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2006, 07:55</p><p>It seems that way, doesn't it, Julian?  Whenever I meet a guy with the glasses of my dreams, there is always some catch -- either they live millions of miles away, or they don't have any interest in me whatsoever, or they're attached, or they just had Lasik the day before they met me, or something! It's strange but true. But it keeps life interesting, anyway! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b><a href="http://eyescene.net/bbs/real.html" target="_blank">Julian</a></b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2006, 04:38</p><p>Honestly, Tinyeyes, you don't have the best of luck, do you? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2006, 00:04</p><p>Well, I ended up hanging out with the -10 guy tonight. It was fun. He is a nice guy and was very happy to wear his glasses for me. The catch is, he is already in a relationship and just looking for a little variety. I hope that isn't too shocking, but I think he is semi-open with his partner, and no harm done hopefully. I think I would like to see him again (for obvious reasons) but also just as friends.  He was mildly fascinated by my glasses fetish.  </p><p> </p><p>As for the glasses, they were quite hot if you like really strong looking glasses. They had tortoise shell frames but the frames were on the larger side. He had told me that he liked the smaller styles popular now, but that he felt his field of vision was too small with those considering his strong RX, so he opted for a larger style when he got new glasses recently. His lenses were impressively thin, but still (to me) very powerful looking with major cut-in, tiny eyes and flat lens fronts that flashed a lot in the light. Super sexy!  And he was quite blind without them. He took them off so I could look at them, and I noticed he seemed almost cross-eyed without them and of course couldn't see anything more than a few inches away. I don't know his exact RX, but I'm thinking maybe -11 or so.  He wears them at home at night, mainly, and uses soft contacts most of the time. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2006, 20:01</p><p>Another great sighting today.  I was shopping in the supermarket and came across a very nice looking young man -- early to mid twenties, tallish, slender in shape working class type wearing jeans and a white T-shirt.  He'd have gotten a glance from me even if he hadn't been wearing glasses. </p><p> </p><p>But the glasses were really nice.  Small, black plastic frames with obviously quite strong plus lenses that were noticably thick in the middle. I can't guess at the prescription (I generally pay more attention to minus glasses) but probably strong enough he'd have difficulty managing without them even with his relatively younthful powers of accomodation. </p><p> </p><p>He looked so cute and hot in those glasses.  Unfortunately he had a wife or girlfriend with him. </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, I too am envious of your -10 guy.  I hope that works out well for you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sam12744</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2006, 00:09</p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>I am so envious! I hope you get your wish with this new guy.Please keep us posted.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2006, 20:44</p><p>I had lunch today with a guy I was meeting from an online connection. He was a very nice guy, and a little less striking than his photos, but pretty cute nonetheless. Mid thirties, buzzed short brown hair, lean build. He wasn't wearing glasses, but I was struck by his vivid light blue eyes. As we talked, I thought I could see the outlines of soft contacts on the whites of his eyes, but I wasn't sure. Finally I said I thought he had really amazing eyes -- he replied that he liked my eyes too and that the color was similar. I said, "Not really, but thanks", and mentioned that I wore contacts. Happily, he immediately said, "I wear contacts too. I can't have lasik because my prescription is too strong." WOW! Of course, HOW STRONG was the next question, and he said around -10. At this point, I went ahead and told him about my preference for guys with glasses, and we had a nice conversation. I hope to see him again -- he seems to be fascinated by my fetish although he doesn't exactly share it. I'm glad I was honest about it. Oh yeah, and tonight, he emailed me a picture of himself in glasses -- not the best picture, but awesome. I am looking forward to seeing him in glasses in person.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2006, 21:06</p><p>Nice sighting yesterday in Wal-Mart -- a very handsome young man, probably early thirties, masculine, tallish, bearded and, of courese, weary nice strongish minus glasses.  Probably -6 or a little more.  He had a wire-rim frame that suited his face perfectly. </p><p> </p><p>He ended up behind me at the checkout stand and gave me a big smile when I said something he found amusing.  Sigh.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plusheavy</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2006, 05:02</p><p>Indeed, but there is this little difference between wanting to do something and being forced to do something. If you absolutely have to wear thick glasses to survive, you certainly provide more excitement to OO's than if you wear thembecause you like it. Likewise, disclosed GOC's are definitely less attractive than those who wear glasses because they have to. All this should be probably posted in the "Psychology of Glasses" section. Anyway that's how I feel about it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>hyperope</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2006, 02:17</p><p>i got a simple solution. the world functions in simple ways, as soon as something is about to disappear or to be replaced by something better there is always the nostalgic, the retro-lovers etc. also, if for instance, glasses shouldn't be available one day, more and more people will take on wanting to wear glasses...thus our fetish is saved forever (and in the near future with many more people). I think this might be a plausible solution. but i reckon we'll just have to wait and see.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plusheavy</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2006, 01:26</p><p>Still the number of people publicly wearing thick, powerful lenses is significantly smaller than in the glorious    sixties and seventies. If contacts, lasik and other pests continue to thrive, in another twenty years all OO's will suffer terrible frustrations. Has anybody any ideas how to prevent this disaster? There's some hope in computer-created, holographic virtual reality. But  is this something to look forward to? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2006, 21:59</p><p>Yes Wayne, it really seems as though the advances in high-index lenses, contacts and lasik have barely kept up with an increasingly myopic population. It seems as though more people are nearsighted (and maybe farsighted) today than in the 1950s and 1960s.  And maybe more are highly myopic.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2006, 17:45</p><p>It appears that Edward had been fitted with bifocals.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2006, 10:54</p><p>Julian's post seems to confirm my remembrance that Lennon didn't wear glasses or contacts on stage (or in public appearances) -- at least at first. </p><p> </p><p>The first contact lenses that were wearable for any length of time became available right at the end of the 50's. In my senior year in high school (59-60)a classmate got them.  He was a very nearsighted (probably -6 or more) Asian football (American) player.  He got them because he hated that he couldn't see what was going on on the field during the game and had to function half-blind playing only defense. </p><p> </p><p>These were hard contacts (not GP) that required skill in fitting and took time to get used to.  I got my first pair around 1964.  It is possible that Lennon tried these contacts at some point before switching to the small oval wirerims which then became popular among  "hippies" like me. </p><p> </p><p>What I find curious is that there seem to be more people wearing glasses now than I remember back then -- despite the fact that so many today are wearing contacts or have had lasik.  It may be that glasses will eventually become obsolete %-( but not real soon %-) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kena</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2006, 20:08</p><p>yes</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2006, 12:03</p><p>Any pictures out there of Prince Edward in plus lens readers?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b><a href="http://eyescene.net/bbs/real.html" target="_blank">Julian</a></b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2006, 10:03</p><p>Years, or maybe decades, ago I had a book called 'John Lennon in his own write'. There was a preface by Paul McCartney who commented on their early acquaintance and said something like: 'Was he deep? He wore glasses so it was possible and without them there was no holding him. "What bus?" he would say to roars of laughter.'</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2006, 08:38</p><p>Wait, maybe I was wrong. I think I have heard that he wore contacts in the 1960s, but maybe not always -- read the liner note bio from this early Beatles album I just found: </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/flangehead2/LPs/VsTheFourSeasons.html" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/flangehead2/LPs/VsTheFourSeasons.html</a> </p><p> </p><p>I think Lennon was really myopic though. Must have been terrible going on stage without any glasses or contacts. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2006, 08:29</p><p>That's really interesting, Wayne. Actually, I have heard that John Lennon did wear contact lenses, even back in the early 1960s. I guess he was an early adopter. He decided to give them up later in his career and that's when he started wearing the wire rim glasses.  I think he was too myopic to go out in public without corrective lenses. Wasn't he about a minus 5 or so?   </p><p> </p><p>I remember very well the days before high index lenses too.  That went well into the 1980s, didn't it?   </p><p> </p><p>I don't know if this is true, but it seems to me that there are more myopic people than there used to be. These days, it seems like every other person wears contacts, but in the old days, were there really that many people wearing glasses (back before contacts became popular?? )  What do you think, Wayne?  I'm 38 so my memory only goes back to the 1970s, and by then contacts were very popular, although soft contacts were just coming out.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2006, 16:27</p><p>In the good old days (50's and 60's when I was young) thickness was a very good indicator of minus rx.  High index lenses didn't exist.  Most frames were plastic.  A bigger frame made lenses thicker but there wasn't as much choice in frame size.  Strong minus lenses were thick and had noticable power rings.  The only way to somewhat disguise a strong prescription was a smaller frame, a frame thick enough to hide the lens edge, polished lens edges and tinting to disguise the rings.   </p><p> </p><p>I knew a very nearsighted guy who always wore very dark prescription sunglasses.  At night he had a big problem -- it was too dark to see through the sunglasses and too blurred without them. </p><p> </p><p>The first change came with the Beatles.  John Lennon started wearing tiny wire-rimmed glasses.  Even with a strong prescription, the thickness was far less noticable.  I don't know how he managed before that when he always appeared bare-eyed in public and while performing.  (Hard (not GP) contact lenses were just becoming available and were expensive and hard to get used to.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>plusheavy</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2006, 13:49</p><p>Power rings may be very misleading just as is thickness of glasses. A lot depends on the kind of material used to make lenses,the kind of frames and the way the lenses are cut to fit the frames. Glasses with equal lenses may look completely different when you compare their power rings. Some impressively looking thick glasses with salient power rings may turn out to be quite weak while very powerful lenses may be cut to look very innocent. Cut-in  and very obvious minification are the only reliable ad hoc signs of above-average power.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2006, 10:58</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes and Julian -- </p><p> </p><p>Haven't posted for a long time but had the most fabulous sighting yesterday.  I was in downtown SF and spotted a guy who looked so much like Jake Gyllenhaal that it actually took me a minute to confirm that that he wasn't the heartthrob du jour.  Best of all, he was wearing prescription Persol sunglasses.  Couldn't resist following him into the Starbucks where he took them off and then put them back on to see the admittedly small writing on the wall-mounted menu.  He then took them off again and was bareyed when he checked out the pastries (a bit myopically). I was hoping that he would put on his regular specs, but he didn't.  I'd estimate his prescription wasn't over a -2, and he probably didn't have another pair with him.  He drank his coffee without and then put them back on when he left.  What a dreamboat!! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2006, 07:11</p><p>No Name, that's a tough one. I'm not sure about the  different kinds of power rings. Guessing glasses prescriptions is kind of an art, I think. On this one, if you can't see cut in, it sounds like it might be a strong astigmatism (prism) correction. The other thing to look for besides cut in, is how much the glasses are minifying (as opposed to magnifying) the eyes, although that should go along with the cut in. The smaller the eyes look behind the lenses, the higher the myopia prescription, hence my nickname for highly nearsighted people, "tinyeyes".</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b><a href="http://eyescene.net/bbs/real.html" target="_blank">Julian</a></b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2006, 23:41</p><p>Larry: another way, and it's the cheapest of all: if you have an old pair of glasses with a weaker Rx, like -4.5 or -5, try changing into them for near work. That ought to help, until you go for a test and get the inevitable bifocals.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-oo-</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2006, 19:52</p><p>Larry, the other possibility is that your myopia has decreased and now your glasses are too strong, so Cactus Jack is right, go get an exam! And then please do report back!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2006, 16:24</p><p>Larry: Presbyopia does not change your basic distance Rx. You are still nearsighted. The problem is that your internal lens, for any of several possible reasons, is loosing its ability to add the plus you nead to focus close. With a distance Rx of -6, taking off your glasses won't work unless you like reading at 16.6 cm (6.5").  </p><p>To focus at reasonable distances, you need some plus, but it has to be added to your existing -6 Rx.  The near add probably won't be very high and it rarely exceeds +3.25.  You will still have a minus Rx even for reading. </p><p>You need to get a new Rx with a reading segment.  Until you can get some new glasses, you can get some over the counter plus reading glasses, they are usually available in strengths from +1.00 to +3.35, amd wear them OVER your regular glasses for reading or other close work.  Pick the lowest value that allows you to read comfortably and one pair may be useful for both reading and the computer. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Larry</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2006, 14:30</p><p>36. So should I go down to the opticians and get a pair of plus specs?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2006, 13:20</p><p>Larry: Welcome to presbyopia. You can develop presbyopia at any age, but how old are you? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Larry</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2006, 12:42</p><p>Is it possible to be short sighted and long sighted at the same time? </p><p>I wear -6 glasses but lately I've found it difficult focusing on items up close.

I don't know what type of computer you use but you can very easily resize pictures using the Microsoft Photo Editor that comes with WindowsXP.

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2006, 08:31</p><p>Hi Jo </p><p> </p><p>And go one time to the Fullerton, there are 2 bellboys, 1 with not strong and 1 with very strong glasses, the not strong in brown plastic frame and the strong one in a small gunmetal frame. I saw this 2 boys only 1 time, the other days when I go meet there some peoples they ar not there anymore or had a free day or a other working time. 2 very handsome boys, both. 19 to 21 y.o. it's difficult for guess, because asians look more younger than they are. Because I like asians peoples I post some asian with glasses in guyglasses10. Have a look. </p><p> </p><p>Greetings from Singa (excalib2000)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2006, 08:54</p><p>Hi together and specially hi Julian. Julian I not forgot to send you something, I had troubles with my computer in home and I will send it soon. </p><p> </p><p>I just come back from a short businesstrip from singapore and I saw so many guys with glasses and some very strong glasses. I will write yet only about one guy (gay). He was the barkeeper in my hotel where I go have some drinks before sleeping. He was in his 20 and for asian very high, approx. 185 cm. Very handsome with short hair styled with gel. He wear a nice uniform (red jacket and black trousers) and of course glasses. Very strong, I guess more than - 10. and the last evening, when he take off his glasses forn clean after making a accident with the mixshaker I ask him, how strong his glasses are. He answered: both side approx. 11 ore something and he say to me me, that he prefer more the glasses than the contacts he wear also from time to time. He had a very modern blacke, small frame with thick temples. The last evening - I come back late to the hotel and the same time he walk out from a side door, in bluejeans and with a white T-shirt and he smile for me (because I was customer) I not think, that he will something from me, however this sighting was so exciting, I not will forgot this young man. The bar was not my style, however the barman, about him I go all evening to this place. </p><p> </p><p>Best regards to all</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lurking</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2006, 20:37</p><p>That rx has to be every bit of -16, maybe even more. He must be really blind without his glasses or contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2006, 22:11</p><p>That's so hot.  I would love to have a boyfriend with that problem.

I wonder if it's for real? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2006, 08:34</p><p>I guess some of us were engaging in wishful thinking about his Rx.  Guessing a prescription from a photo can be tricky.  There is a noticable cutin but I suspect the blurred background created by the camera focus is giving an impression of a stronger Rx in the glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Still, -4+ is not an insignificant prescription.  It's similar to my Rx and I wouldn't be comfortable trying to manage without my glasses</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chet</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2006, 16:28</p><p>I wrote to him and he said his glasses are -4.25 in the left eye and -4.75 in the right.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wei</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2006, 09:44</p><p>I about -4 maybe much as -5</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>royboy</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2006, 18:56</p><p>i would vouch not over -5</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2006, 10:21</p><p>I agree he is really hot and those glasses are quite strong.  I think -10 would be pushing it but -7 or -8 seems likely.  He'd certainly find it difficult to act bare-eyed (or do much of anything).  I'm going to have to check out that show.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2006, 05:44</p><p>I've never seen this guy. Wow!  He's cute!  Great glasses and strong RX. To me, the cut-in suggests at least -7 perhaps up to -10 or so. Definitely wearing contacts whenever he's not in glasses with that high RX. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sam12744</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2006, 01:32</p><p>Hi </p><p>Sadbluesfan's glasses appear to be significantly thicker on the outer edges than the inner ones,suggesting base-out prisms(which,incidentally appear to have been trimmed off at the rear edge to reduce the thickness by a couple of mm or more).Hence the query as to whether they include prisms.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mattp</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2006, 09:39</p><p>Interesting sighting at the gym today.  Walked in ahead of a nice looking young man (20 or so) in rather strong plus glasses.  Couldn't look too well because he was behind me, so turning around was obvious.  In the locker room , he took his glasses off like you're supposed to but no one ever does--used two hands, gently folded the temples, and carefully placed them lens side up on the locker shelf.  Given the strength of the lenses, i was sure he'd put them back on when he was through changing.  But no--he came out to the machines bare-eyed!  he did fine except when setting the numbers on the treadmill--lots of squinting and leaning back and changing things after he started.  Also, his right eye had a nice turn in--he spent a lot of time with extra turns of his head to see things to his right.  I would have thought he would be most uncomfortable without his glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2006, 08:00</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wow!  Sadbluesfan's lenses are really more that coke bottles!  -23 is pretty awesome!  They do not appear to be bifocals or trifocals.  Perhaps progressives?  But are they prisms? </p><p>Does Sandbluesfan post on any of the Eysescene threads? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Eustace</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doreen</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2006, 04:57</p><p>Nice encounter today. I was visiting the company I had worked for in summer. One of my colleagues once mentioned he wore contacts back then. Today he was wearing glasses because of an eye infection. I felt sorry for him about that. Nevertheless he looked rather cute in them, but he's also really handsome without. The glasses were black plastic frames not quite rectangular. Framed his face nicely though and matched with his blond hair. I'm not good at guessing Rx, but I'd say -3.00 or -4.00 maybe a bit higher - I can't tell. Kind of made my day! No need to phantasize about what he might look like in glasses anymore.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2006, 20:15</p><p>Met a guy for coffee tonight. We met a few months ago, but never connected again until now -- kind of found each other again online.  We were very attracted to each other, but I'm not sure where it will lead.  He knows about my glasses fetish and thinks it's cool. He's in his early forties, tall and slim with short hair turning gray, and kind of the "alternative" type with tattoos.  He wore his glasses for me to the coffee date, and they're really nice -- small, wide rectangular black plastic frames with fairly thick bifocal lenses that seem to be about minus 9. They make his blue eyes look quite small, and the wide frames really show off the "cut-in" quite nicely. It was also nice when he leaned his head against his hand during conversation, so that his fingers were visible through the lenses, looking really tiny. We were together for about an hour and a half and those glasses didn't move from his face once.  I think I would enjoy removing them (and replacing them again eventually, of course.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>stilllurking</b>&nbsp;05 Jan 2006, 20:57</p><p>Micha: Those glasses really are crazy-thick. They almost have to be well over -20.0</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2006, 21:56</p><p>Well that was interesting.  Why are people posting videos like that?  I couldn't tell much about the RX from what the glasses looked like, but the guy acted as if his RX was at least -7 or above if the glasses were that invisible.  Of course, the whole thing was being acted out, so maybe the glasses were just a prop and didn't even belong to the guy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2006, 12:03</p><p>Had a great sighting this weekend...  but kind of an unusual one. I was at a large new years eve party, with probably two hundred people (almost all guys.)  It was at a very nice house with several bedrooms. I went into one of the guest bathrooms, and saw a glasses case, contact lens case and solution. Of course I coudn't resist checking out what was inside the glasses case.  My curiosity was rewarded with a pair of VERY strong minus prescription, wire rim glasses.  True coke bottles!  I tried them on quickly and they seemed super strong.  I quickly removed my contact lens and tried again.  I could immediately see that the glasses were much stronger than my own prescription, which is minus eight!  I'm guessing they were around -12 or -13. They were probably around 3/16" thick and deeply concave, with polished edges. The glasses were kind of older looking, and so was the case which was a little dirty and battered.  They were obviously back-up glasses for a guy who was wearing his contacts at the party.  The trouble was, I don't know who the mystery occupant of the room was!!  It was a large party and I knew of several guys who might have been house guests of the host.  I have an idea who it was, but I'm not sure.  Whoever it is, I've never seen them in those glasses before.  So, a great sighting, but a slightly frustrating for me, since I'm such a high-minus lover.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wei</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2005, 10:26</p><p>Have any person see glasses with over +10 worn on person?  I never actually see but see very high - rx on occasion. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>reese</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2005, 09:52</p><p>I don't wear glasses myself, but I find guys who do very very sexy.  I think it is hot when a guy with thick glasses takes them off and can't see. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2005, 06:51</p><p>I got caught in one of those situations today, the sort where you see someone you know pretty well for the very first time with glasses, and didnt know whether to comment or not. I know this guy wears a prescription the same as mine and have come across him sometimes without his contacts (see I'm not the only one!!), so I presumed he rarely wore glasses. On those occasions when hes been without his contacts hes sometimes said things like I cant see a thing  Today we were at the gym which isnt necessarily a taxing visual environment so perhaps they were new or this is a part of a new look. They were bronze semi-rimless with quite wide arms.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sydneycider</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2005, 15:04</p><p>Wow wat a day I had yesterday!!! I went to the shopping centre to have a look at the boxing day sales and it was as if Santa had sprinkled guys in glasses all over xmas! They where everywhere. Two of note....the first kinda locked eyes with me tall, blond had been working out with really brown skin in a singlet with silver oval frames about +5 or 6. Next was at the beach, once again quite a few spexy dudes but there was a young kid say 20, who was once prolly quite skinny but had obviously been working out checking his body building results in the reflection of his car. Black wire rectangular frames with a high minus prolly around -9 or double digits! Would like to see both of them again ;)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;24 Dec 2005, 18:42</p><p>Great sighting! I hope Santa brings me a gorgeous in -9 glasses (or higher!)  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;24 Dec 2005, 15:35</p><p>I just returned from last minute Christmas shopping.  Happy birthday Jesus and thank you for the lovely gift you gave ME of many guys in glasses at the mall.  The most memorable was a gorgeous Latin guy in rectangular wire rims holding high index lenses that must have been about -9.00, give or take, a diopter.  I saw him in four different stores and it wasn't as if I was stalking him either.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2005, 22:45</p><p>OK, I finally have a sighting to report. I haven't had many lately that seemed worth mentioning! I was at the gym at lunchtime, and there was this cute white guy, early 30s, kind of short but well built. He was fair skinned and his brown hair was buzzed really short.  He also had a very short trimmed beard or 5-oclock shadow thing going on, which looked pretty cute. I noticed his glasses flashing in the light as he was on the cross country cardio machine, yakking on the phone.  His glasses were modern yet retro looking, kind of an updated Floyd the barber style. Top of the frames was black and the bottom was rimless with fairly thick lenses.  His bluish eyes were nicely minimized by his glasses, and when I got a better look at him I could tell he was around a -7 myope probably. Sexy sighting!  He didn't seem to return my glances, so we didn't meet and I wasn't able to tell him how sexy he looked in his glasses! :-)</p><p></p><hr>

It seems to me that the young man you admired so much might be a new wearer who has only recently discovered that he needs glasses and is under the impression that they are only for reading but now that his eyes are relaxing is gradually finding he can't see anything without them. Certainly anybody with +3, not to mention cylinder, will benefit from full time wear.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2005, 01:29</p><p>Hi together </p><p> </p><p>Yesterday I had a very strange/nice sighting. I went to a supermarket to a evening sales (all fridays) and saw many nice guys in glasses, from one I will write more, because this was a strange sighting. A young man, mabe 19 .. 21 y.o., very handsome, short, brown hairs and in black Levis?? with a brown leatherjacket and a white neckerchief shopping there and follows something in the foodmarket. If he look something he put allways his glasses on his nose and take them off again all the times, same readers. I'am shure thats not was readers, I can see that the lenses was about + 3.00 sph. with a lot of cylinders. I think he must weat this glasse all the time, not only for reading. The handling of his glasses was same as a older man and this was for me very strange and in the same time also very exciting, because he was young. I follow him very discreet and watching him about 10 minutes. When he go to the cashier he put his glasses back in a hard box and put the box in his jacket. The glasses was in brown plastic, oval style, very nice glasses, make look him very good.  </p><p>After him was a other woman and than me. When him will oay, he take off again the box with the glasses and put them on his nose again for take off the money from his volet. This was a really exciting and strange watching for me. Finally I forget many things I will buy and must go back again in the market. </p><p> </p><p>Many greeting from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

Let it be said: I started this thread originally, and my hope was that it would be a place for guys or girls who are turned on by guys in glasses to talk about it.  Other talk is welcome of course, but that's kind of the focus (no pun intended.)  Post some sightings, or any other thoughts about guys in their gorgeous glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2005, 17:18</p><p>Aaron </p><p>I don't think so. I've just got use to wearing bifocals. I've been wearing them about three months now. They work well for me most times.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doreen</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2005, 06:39</p><p>I have a nice sighting to report: At one of my classes in university I've noticed a guy in his early 20s wearing glasses. He is blond, short hair and rather pale-from Hungary as far as I know. Of course I noticed the glasses first :) Well, at the beginning he used to put them on at the beginning of class and take them off before he left -also during the break. Watching while I was bored by the lecture I saw that he was lifting up his glasses closer to his face as if his prescription was too weak. Last time I saw him he was already wearing his glasses before class and didn't take them off afterwards. Seemy like he has gone into full-time wear. Anyway he is due for a new prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Paul</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2005, 03:05</p><p>Jules: I like Julian's Jottings as your sort of running diary... surely Guys in Glasses is the place for everyone else's sightings and stories rather than some sort of encounter group for the "add"/bifocals/trifocals/progressives/telescope/zoom lens brigade.  </p><p> </p><p>(Not that I really give a stuff.

<p><b><a href="http://eyescene.net/bbs/real.html" target="_blank">Julian</a></b>&nbsp;04 Nov 2005, 08:50</p><p>Ricky: do you have an old pair of glasses, maybe 1 dioptre less than your present distance Rx? If you do you might be cofortable wearing those for prolonged work on the computer.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 Nov 2005, 06:55</p><p>Ricky - I also wear trifocals and the intermediate segment is fine for short periods with the computer.  For longer periods I have some +1.00 and +1.50 clip-ons that let me use the distance portion of my glasses for the computer and I don't have to tilt my head for extended periods and get a crick in my neck. </p><p>The reason I have two powers is for two computers with diferent distances to the monitor. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bethanne</b>&nbsp;04 Nov 2005, 06:20</p><p>Ricky: </p><p>Have you thought about trifocals to use with the computer.  When I first got bifocals with a +1.75 add, I had the same problem you are having, then I got trifocals and they work great.  My Dr. says trifocals are usually necessary when the add is +2.0 or greater.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carter</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2005, 17:57</p><p>Adam--how old were you when you started wearing glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2005, 17:23</p><p>Geoff </p><p>The bifocals are fine. Great for close up work. For computer work there the least satisfactory. I  use the distance part of the lens which is a little bit of a strain unless I'm a little bit farther from the screen but the reading lens is to strong.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2005, 07:55</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Stuart, </p><p> </p><p>Yes, it's been a long time since my last post. </p><p> </p><p>I did get my reading glasses and use them pretty much seamlessly with my distance glasses.  They're 2.5 diopters less powerful than my distance glasses so I really notice the difference in my distance vision if I keep them on for anything beyond reading -- even the computer. My distance vision with my readers on is about the equivalent of someone who sees at -3.5/-4.0.  They're a bit thinner than my other pair but only to me and then only when I place the two pairs together.  My doctor said that my distance prescription should be increased by -.50 in each eye, but I haven't had that done yet.  How about you?  Has your latest prescription continued to work out for you or are you eyes still getting more myopic? </p><p> </p><p>Hope all is well with you down under.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoff</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2005, 05:03</p><p>Rick, how is life with the bifocals?  Any problems with close-up work on the computer?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stuart  </b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2005, 18:15</p><p>Patrick B </p><p> </p><p>I haven't heard anything for a while and I was wondering how the new reading glasses were going. Have you received them? Are you perfecting the art of seamlessly changing from one pair to the other? </p><p> </p><p>I must say that I am getting better at it. If I think of what I'm doing- no problem . I find wearing a shirt with a pocket or jacket with  a pocket helpful for an unnoticeable switch. However I left a client's office the other day with my reading glasses on and didn't realise till I stood up and was ready to shake hands.

<p><b>mattp</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2005, 08:07</p><p>Interesting sighting/story the last couple days.  I run a small bed and breakfast "part-time", and Friday night a nice looking guest arrived quite late wearing glasses that suited his face well.  He was about 40, dark hair, dark shadow on his thin cheeks, plastic glasses in a modern "swoop" shape, obviously minus lenses but apparently quite weak.  Thought no more about it. </p><p> </p><p>I was quite surprised the next morning at breakfast when he appeared wearing gunmetal gray, large, round metal frames--very much out of style.  The lenses were noticeably thick at the edges with lots of power rings.  Of course I had to notice, just stating "Different glasses, this morning, Mike."  Conversation ensued, including trying on each other's glasses. </p><p> </p><p>He didn't know his RX, but we agreed it was close to mine (-4.75).  He had just picked up the the Friday night glasses before leaving on his trip--they had hi-index lenses and his first reading add in progressives.  He found they were great on the plane because he was able to comfortably read, but he was finding they tired his eyes in general wear, thus the morning switch to his old glasses.  He liked my trifocals--thought they were easier to use than his progressives--although my add was considerably more than his. </p><p> </p><p>The incident brought back memories of my first bifocals.  They are 'tiring" for the first few days.  I was also amazed at how thin hi-index lenses can be.  When I get new glasses, hopefully rimless, I may look into them.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>scott102022</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2005, 12:30</p><p>Hello, first time posting and I wanted to make everyone aware of a movie I rented this weekend from Blocbuster. Its called bluecitrushearts and it is a gay movie about coming out in Memphis. The main character Sam wears really thick glasses, and on the jacket of the DVD both characters are wearing glasses. Its and OK movie however you won't be able to take your eyes off Sam. The writer of the story also wears glasses and is the movie. There are some close up of Sam and his glasses, you can tell the director like guys in glasses. I though it was so good to watch I went online and purchased the movie at www.ariztical.com cost about $37 US for shipping and handling. Check it out Peace!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2005, 23:29</p><p>Nice sighting tonight at the supermarket (in gay area of town.)  A Filipino or Southeast Asian looking guy, 30s, nice looking, with stylish rectangular rimless glasses that were around -7 or so. They were quite thick!  It's amazing how thick and chunky some of these rimless glasses are these days, even with high index.  I wouldn't want to walk around in glasses that thick, even though I know rimless is supposed to be thicker. But he looked very sexy in them!</p><p></p><hr>

I can see nothing in the near, I mean nothing clear to read something. In my home I can follw something without glasses, however driving car without glases is enough dangerous. I can see in the far, however all is a blurr. </p><p> </p><p>The first in the morning is put the glasses and the last in the night is take off my glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I like plusglasses in your strenght and I like wear also strong GOC-Combos, I have plus 8 and plus 12-glasses, however I will try in the next future about 18 plus. For me alone in home, I not will go in street with such frogeyes and I not like to wear them all the time, only for myself giving a good feeling. If I see guys with glasses between 3 and 8 I like it so much. Prismn glasses can not see so much, because until 4 itßs difficult to see the prismn, however from 6 or more high the prismn make a in cut same the strong minusglasses even you have the prismn in the plusglasses. I am a big admirer of lenses, the frame is secondary, however also ugly frames I not like so much. </p><p> </p><p>I have really a very big obsession of glasses since I can remember me. My greatest wish when i was a child was to receiving glasses, however I never got them in my childhood. The first I find somewhere and I not give back thios glasses to the owner. I was very happy to walk with this glasses in the forrest, when nobody can watching me, thats was the heaven on earth for me, same for many peoples here also. I have so many storys for write ans I hope i can do it in future. I start to speak english only when I was 42 y.o. and learning by myself, I never had a lesson in school. i speak German, French and Italian, the 3 languages we have in my country. </p><p> </p><p>Hear something from you next time. </p><p> </p><p>Many greeting from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;03 Oct 2005, 15:40</p><p>While at the grocery store the other day saw a very cute young blonde guy with glasses about -5.  He started mopping up in the produce department and watched him go through different parts of the store.  His glasses looked great on him.  Black frames, rectangular, wide frames.  I remember seeing him on other visits, but never wearing glasses.  He must also wear contacts.  When I was through shopping, I saw him one last time, but this time without his glasses.  I was trying to figure out if he was going without glasses or inserted his contacts.  I overheard the cashier talking about the same guy studying to become a cashier and waiting to take the exam that day.  Made me wonder if he wore his glasses just for the exam. Hope he passes the test so that I can go to his register to pay for groceries.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2005, 17:29</p><p>Sydneycider, I agree about Eric.  He seems to have a higher RX than -6 or -7.  Some of those pics have a real high-minus look.  I'd say he looks closer to a -9 or -10.  He's kinda cute. It looks like he's lost a little weight in the more recent photos.  </p><p></p><hr>

They're pretty complete re our visual issues, and I am hesitant to bore people again with another recitation of my own.  Anyway, I don't do much at all without glasses; I could walk downtown under the right circumstances (i.e., daytime)  but certainly wouldn't.  Yes, I do shower and head to the john without glasses and prefer to see the person I'm with in bed.  The only thing that really bugs me about super high myopia is not being able to read without glasses.  It'd be nice to read a book in bed without having to wear them. </p><p> </p><p>Stuart, </p><p> </p><p>Glad you got your new readers and were able to retire the "monsters".  I've ordered a proper pair myself and will unload the "monsters" I have been using when not in a public space.  The cosmetic difference between the myos and the conventional lenses is so great that I wish I had done the switch years before.  Not surprised, by the way, that your readers aren't strong enough to work with when you're with clients.  I think I calculated that you would probably be seeing somewhere around 20/150 and that really isn't good enough to gauge someone's face from across a room or large conference table.  Glad they look so good and people think your eyes have improved!  I suspect that you will learn (as I hope to) how to minimize the switching back and forth which can be distracting.  Let me know how you continue to make out.</p><p></p><hr>

I am embarrassed to tell you what my Rx is, as it is so much weaker than yours.  But I never, ever take my glasses off except when I go to sleep--and then I don't take them off until I have snapped off my beside lamp. I wear them when I shower, shave, swim, go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, make love, or have sex. I just feel so disoriented and helpless without them. (Well, I do have to take them off when I go to the barber shop.)  I would be interested in knowing if you actually try to walk from one room to another in your apartment without your specs.  If you do, don't you stumble into furniture or hit door frames?  I have been wearing glasses since I was 12 and have had tri-focals for the last several years. Thanks! </p><p> </p><p>Eustace </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eustace</b>&nbsp;19 Sep 2005, 15:04</p><p>TO:  Patrick B </p><p> </p><p>I was intrigued by your postings of 10 and 11 September.  Did I understand correctly your current Rx (-26 and -3.75) and that your ealiest Rx at age 6 or 7 was -3?  I don't know how old you are now--or what sort of special eye condition/problem you may have developed over the years, but isn't that a dramatic increase?  At what age did your vision rapidly begin to worsen?  Do you wear bifocals, trifocals, prisms, or myodiscs?  (If you have posted all this previously, please excuse me.  I do wish that Eyescene had some kind of buil-in indexing system--so one could go back at look up postings from a particular person.)  And my I ask how thick your lenses are?

<p><b>How to meet myopic guys?</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2005, 09:45</p><p>Tiny eyes, you already have the advantage of being a high myope yourself, but you have said that you prefer to wear your contacts.  Try wearing your glasses 24/7 for one whole week.  You will be amazed at how many guys will "out" themselves as myopes.  Some of them have probably been digging you, but have never made their move because their insecurity about how you might react once you see their strong glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2005, 08:16</p><p>The latest with my boyfriend situation:  </p><p>I spent time this weekend with the new guy, who has had lasik to go from -9 to 0.  "Victor" is great, but I sure wish he hadn't had that surgery.  He still hasn't found his old RX, which would help me get the GOC thing going for him.  But it's great to talk openly about my fetish --- he is totally OK with it and seems to think it's kind of exciting. He's not an "OO" himself though.  </p><p> </p><p>I still feel pangs of regret over "Nick", the one who got away, though.  He still has Victor's "pre-op" level of myopia, but was uncooperative about continuing to date me!   </p><p> </p><p>Does anyone else have similar experiences to me, of trying to date guys who are very myopic?  I see that a lot of people on here, and also on the Guys Glasses Yahoo group, really like the guys with strong minus prescriptions, but no one ever seems to mention anything about actually looking for (or having) a myopic boyfriend. Anyone?  Am I alone in this?  Maybe you're all happily settled in relationships.  </p><p> </p><p>For me, just looking a pics online isn't enough. I need the real deal!  Although, Victor is so cute and so sweet, and at least formerly myopic, that he might be an important exception!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stuart  </b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2005, 16:11</p><p>Patrick B </p><p> </p><p>Interesting that you think your Rx is increasing - that's also my situation.  </p><p> </p><p>As you say there's no point whining! I find that I accommodate without thinking to my vision problems. I do find it embarassing when I am caught out </p><p>as in my last post. A psycholoist could have a field day analysing that!! </p><p> </p><p>As for bare eyed - I swim at the beach and do laps  which can be difficult and makes me feel vulnerable! I also find it an effort as I have to really concentrate on my movements and measure distances in my mind.  I don't even go h the toilet at night without my glasses anymore afyer virtually falling over my flat mate. New York bare eyed would be a real experience - orienation would be the biggest problem .  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2005, 15:57</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>RL, </p><p> </p><p>My current prescrition is OS -26 and OD -23.75.  I think it has got a tad worse.  At my age I would have thought it would have been completely stable.  Incidentally, when I was at your level of myopia, I was pretty close to 20/20, although suffering from problems of minimification.  I'm close to 20/20 with RGP contacts which is a blessing. </p><p> </p><p>Gus, </p><p> </p><p>Most high myopes have acuity problems at night even when they're wearing glasses.  In the elongated eyeball, the rods and cones are not as close together as they would be in a normal eye; hence, the added lack of acuity in the dark.  Wandering to the bathroom at night isn't a problem, but I wouldn't want to leave my casa unaided.  No way!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2005, 07:56</p><p>Patric B. </p><p>What is your current prescription? I am a -14 (-15) if you include astigmatism and my far point is about 2.5 inches. Luckily I correct to 20/20.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gus</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2005, 23:35</p><p>Patric B:At least you can function to some extent (but not very well) witout you glasses as long you're in a well lit area. Have you had to go somewhere that was dark without your glasses? I imagine that trying to find your glasses in that kind of environment would be more than a little challenging.   </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2005, 10:40</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jim, </p><p> </p><p>I was around a -2 when I was probably six or seven before getting my first pair of galsses as a -3, and I do remember how much clearer they made things.  Nevertheless, I could still do a lot of stuff without them, like swim, read, play games and all of that.  Before long, though, I found that I wore them all of the time as my vision got worse and worse.  By -5/-6 you really don't see well at all and have to hold a book too close to one's face to be able to see comfortably.  Still, I could have got by if I had had to. </p><p> </p><p>At this juncture I can't see more than an inch or two away from my face  -- great for threading a needle but that's about it.  (And I don't sew, anyway)  I could probably walk from my apartment downtown during the daylight without glasses, but I could never jaywalk (since I can't see up the street well enough to ascertain if a car is coming).  I only feel comfortable crossing if there is a controlled intersection with red/green crosswalk lights which I can sort of spot if the street isn't too wide.  I can identify buildings that I know and become aware of visual "disturbances" which are people walking towards me.  Nevertheless, if I were placed in Manhattan and not told which direction was uptown and which downtown, I would probably not know which direction I was going (i.e., north or south) unless the sun was beginning to set in the west.  At night I am hopeless and would need to feel my way along a street by running my hands along a building to give me guidance.  My "disturbances" aren't even visible at night so I could easily trip over someone camped on the sidewalk or run into someone who was walking. </p><p> </p><p>Well, hope that give you a hint of life as a high myope.  Stuart and Wei have similar visual acuity.  Frankly, anything over -9 puts you roughly in that category, although someone with a -9 can wear glasses that aren't as thick and can generally be corrected to a full 20/20, which Stuart and I haven't got with the best correction.  And,if my glasses move even a small amount away from my face, I probably lose five diopters.  You are probably a 20/80 uncorrected; Since my last exam (nearly six months ago) I believe my myopia has increased a bit, and I am now 20/40 corrected and probably 20/60 uncorrected at night or in a twilight state.  So if you want to know how I see with glasses, just take yours off!!  </p><p></p><hr>

It seems so unfair that I can't see even to read.  Whine, whine. Since so many people haven't a clue about our level of myopia, it is simply incomprehensible to them just how little we do see without correction.

<p><b>Geoff</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2005, 06:30</p><p>Anderson, you probably should go ahead and get the bifocals.  If you think that you need them, it means that you do.  You will notice from postings that Rick was not inclined to wear bifocals at first, but now he is sold on the concept.  The ability to focus close-up only declines with each passing year.

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2005, 20:41</p><p>To fill everyone in who cares --- Nick, the cute highly myopic guy I was dating, is no more.  He broke up with me!  He seemed to have intimacy issues.  I was disappointed, because this guy was my fantasy, but I could tell he wasn't warming up to me. Why I'm not sure ---  we definitely had physical chemistry!   </p><p>Anyway, I recently met a really nice guy who was also a high myope --- I say "was" because he tragically had Lasik 2 years ago!  He found out right away that I am an OO because a friend blabbed about it to him, and he is kind of receptive to it. He actually is willing to wear his old glasses for me, but it's not easy for him. So, I actually suggested GOC, and he says he is willing.  It seems  a little crazy, and I don't know if it will happen, but I'm looking into it.  What a nice guy, willing to indulge me this way!  And a cutie too.  Too bad he had the surgery --- I'm not sure how I feel about that yet, but I really like him, so I'm hoping this GOC thing could work for me.  All this certainly gets my mind off "Nick".</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2005, 18:22</p><p>Andersen </p><p>I think you come dependent on bifocals very quickly and find what you use to read through the distance lens you can't anymore. I don't even try as I wear bifocals all the time now and always read through the reading lens even if I have to tilt my head up to do this. I have the pc screen nearer me and use reading lens for this to.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anderson</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2005, 07:05</p><p>Thanks, Ricky.  I currently do not wear bifocals but have been giving some thought to them.  It seems that I am having to take my glasses off more frequently to read the newspaper.  Yet, I thought that at 35 I am too young for  bifocals.  So, I am glad that you have had good experience with bifocals.  Are you still able to read close-up through your distance prescription or are you now dependent on reading lenses?  Thanks for any advice you can give.  Andy</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2005, 19:47</p><p>Andersen </p><p>The bifocals are working great. If you think you need them. I recommend them. Don't wait cause its pointless. Readings not going to get easier if you wait. I've got completely use to my bifocals wearing them all the time and not just for work. I use only single vision glasses for sport. My eyes seem to have made the adjustment and I go from distance to reading without thinking. </p><p>Yes, I can expect to have to get stronger plus lens but not for a while yet. My distance Rx may change to but my distance vision is not geing worse like it use to.Which is something. </p><p>Do you wear bifocals or think you need them? Cheers. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hey simeon fan, Original Tony</b>&nbsp;03 Sep 2005, 09:24</p><p>I may have to consider joining Bukbuddies to see more of Simeon.  I agree that he seems shy when he is bare-eyed.  If his specs keep getting stronger, then he either  (A) started posing when he became legal and 5 years later his eyes havent stabilized yet, or  (B) hes one of us and wears stronger glasses than he needs.  Probably A, but I suspect a little bit of OO in him because most guys, as hot and myopic as he is, would opt for contacts.  He also seems to be as well endowed in the manhood department as he is in the myopia department.   Is he?  Are there pics of other high myopes in the paid version of Bukbuddies? </p><p> </p><p>Original Tony - Those Reid twins are super myopic.  Too bad they are not as handsome as the another twin act - Evan and Jaron.  Image those two in Craig and Charlies glasses?  The bbc link didnt seem to work, can you check it? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>simeon fan</b>&nbsp;03 Sep 2005, 06:02</p><p>Great pic - Simeon is worth the price of joining Bukbuddies; there's hundreds of pics of him taken over 5 years and the specs get stronger. Many pics show him wearing plano sunglasses - he usually seems really shy about being photographed totally bare-eyed, maybe because sometimes you can tell he can't see. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2005, 00:50</p><p>Geoff &amp; Mark </p><p>Things are going fine. In fact I don't think about my new bifocals most of the time as I am learning to look over or through the reading lens without thinking. I don't notice the reading lens now when I'm looking at distance. Though others have noticed my bifocals cause the large 35mm lens does show against the flat surface of my distance lens. People have asked questions as they have not seen a 30 year person with bifocals. I know it is not common but they work for me. The large reading lens is very good for work with spredsheets and that. I also don't think now to turn my head to look down not my eyes or my feet and the ground is a blurr. </p><p>One inconvenience. I forgot my single vision glasses when I went to the sports centre for badminton. Show show use to tehm I've got. Bifocals are fine everyday but they are no good for sport and the shuttlecock goes in and out of focus. Hopeless. So I had to give up playing. From now on I am going to keep my old glasses in my sports bag. </p><p>So I'm adapting fine and soon I will not notice them at all. One thing for sure I need the reading lens and can't do without them. I know I will not go back to a single lens again for normal wear. </p><p>So Geoff and Mark has your experience of bifocals been the same?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>about the BB site...</b>&nbsp;27 Aug 2005, 11:13</p><p>I have been poking around the BB site for a while.  There are others, but Simeon has the strongest prescription of the guys who actually wear glasses.  While poking around, you'll find some guys that, unfortunately, wear contacts.  Some of the pictures enlarge quite big.  I have spotted some contacts in the close-ups.  I bet some of those guys have prescriptions that make Simeon's seem mild.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2005, 22:55</p><p>Thought I might as well follow up on my recent optometrist visits.  I was prescribed a new pair of RGP contacts, which we immediately realized weren't quite right in my left eye (the RX seemed to be off a little).  After a little over a week, I went back tonight and it turned out I was one diopter too weak in the left eye.  I think what had happened was that the old contact I was wearing on that eye had distorted my cornea and actually made it a little less myopic, but after the new contact was worn a little while, my eye went back "baseline".  I guess. I don't think this is a very exact science sometimes.  Anyway, I should be getting the new slightly stronger lens in a few days.  Happily, the new contacts aren't giving me the spectacle blur I was getting before, so they must be better for my eyes, even if they are allowing the eye to go back to a more myopic state!   </p><p> </p><p>Did I mention that the eye doctor is really nice, and cute (and spexy?) But also seems really straight. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

How strong is the add portion?  </p><p> </p><p>I think in the long run you will be pleased that you made the switch to multi-focals and my guess is that very few will notice that you are wearing bifocals. </p><p> </p><p>Keep us posted on how you are doing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;18 Aug 2005, 18:35</p><p>I picked up my new bifocal glasses on Wednesday leaving my other glasses at the optician. So today is the start of my second day wearing the bifocals. I had to wear them cause there the only ones I have with the right Rx. </p><p>So what do I think? Reading is much easier and less strain. I did not realise how much they would improve this. For that my new glasses are great. </p><p>Still I must say they are quite strange. I have not got use to them. I am aware of the reading lens below my eye alot of the time and have not got use to the smaller distant vision area of the glasses. I haven't got use to controlling my eye so I get a jumpy image at times when I look throught the line of the bifocal lens. Then I'm not use to turning my head to look down without that the ground is blurry particularly when walking outside in the street. </p><p>How long did it take for you to get use to bifocals? </p><p>The frames are nearly square in gunmetal like my old ones. The bifocal part shows more than I thought as it is the bigger size, 35mm. But then noone at work has commented on my new glasses so may be it doesn't show that much. </p><p>That is it. May be I'll know in the next couple of weeks how I will adapt to bifocals.</p><p></p><hr>

I've always found that glasses suit men and have always liked glasses on men who are a bit rough.  Suppose it's the contrast between a tough guy and weak eyes.  You'll have to come back to the States! </p><p> </p><p>As to the contacts, I probably wear them around 50% of the time now.  Never around the house anymore or at work but if I know that I will need better vision (e.g, nighttime driving or a movie) then I will wear them.  Yesterday I was wearing my glasses while doing some paperwork and they felt heavy so I took them off and tried to work without for a bit.  Basically, it was impossible after a minute or two.  I have never been bothered by distance blur but have always found it disconcerting that I can't see more than an inch from my nose which even makes reading an impossibility for more than a short time. </p><p> </p><p>Looking forward to your new readers critique.</p><p></p><hr>

It is also likely that you can't locate your glasses despite caerful placement if you do try when needed "during the event". That has been my experience on the odd occasion that it has occured . </p><p> </p><p>I must admit that a handsome  man with the right glasses makes an especially attractive prospect for me but it is not essential.

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2005, 17:10</p><p>Patrick, </p><p>Your mechanic guy sounds great!  As for Asian guys, don't knock it til you've tried it!  "When you've had Chinese, nothing else will please!" Just kidding, but I do like Asian guys a lot, and partly because so many of them need glasses, but that's not the only reason.  I am "equal oppotunity" and find all races can be very attractive, but Asian is defnitely a favorite of mine (BTW I'm 100% Caucasian.)  Nick is a change of pace for me, because he is white, but super cute and of course, super myopic.  Hard to ignore!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2005, 16:13</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Stuart, </p><p> </p><p>I'm no kid but have found that glasses are quite the turn-on for young Latinos.  Maybe it's part of a white daddy figure image that they like.  Whatever. Nevertheless, I must say doing it  blind can be quite erotic but only when I feel completely comfortable with the other partner.  Of course, when I have done it blind without any real knowledge of my sex partner I have always enjoyed -- to a point and, perhaps, foolishly -- that added element of "danger".  My glasses, however, are always near at hand (i.e.,under the bed where I can reach for them at a moment's notice). Looking forward to your critique of your new readers from Optical4Less.  </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>Glad that you and Nick are still seeing each other.  As I said earlier, your online sisters are hoping for the very best.  Funny thing about glasses, while I'm not quite the oo you and Julian are (I'm more technically interested from my own experiences), I must say that the right glasses can really make the man.  I'm not especially into Asians, but my car mechanic is a rather attractive, tall (they're getting big in the US) 35 year-old and wears -8/9s. I hate to admit it but those thick lenses do make me look at him in a different light.  While he is ostensibly straight, I do think he would be amenable to a fling on the wild side with a middle-aged man.  Keep us posted on "Nick".   </p><p>    </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2005, 13:54</p><p>Boy I am an incurable OO.  Was at a party this weekend, and there was a really hot looking, hunky Asian guy in our conversation group.  He started obviously having problems with his contacts -- rubbing eyes, blinking, and finally had to excuse himself -- he never said it was contacts, but I'm sure it was.  I was SOOO turned on!  </p><p> </p><p>Saw "Nick" this weekend too -- also in contacts.  But still nice to see him  :-)  Just knowing he is a high myope is such a turnon!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoff</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2005, 12:19</p><p>Rick, are you excited about getting the bifocals?  I think you really be pleased with your close-up vision now and not having the nuisance of removing your glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2005, 06:43</p><p>Stuart, I have dealt with Optical4less on several occasions, always with eventual success.  Didn't you get an immediate email confirmation of your order?  That always came in within a few minutes of ordering.  I think my credit card was debited pretty quickly too.  I'm wondering whether your order went through alright. </p><p>In the confirmation message they supplied a link which allowed me to track the order. </p><p>Anyway, it always took a few weeks to a month to receive my glasses but it was worth the wait.  Best of luck!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stuart</b>&nbsp;14 Aug 2005, 22:04</p><p> Patrick B </p><p> </p><p>I ordered the readers a week ago through the Optical4less web site. It was a straight forward process, but I had previously checked the web site order process and had all the deatils at hand. That was a week ago and so far I have not heard anything, nor has my credit dard been debited. I have been told  that hasseling causes slow down and that patience is essential. Like you I will pay less than 50% of the discouinted price I pay here. I will keep you informed. </p><p> </p><p>Personally I prefer sex with glasses  for the ease and visual turn on. In my younger wilder single days I never took the cls out till after the act and more than once I would forget and wake up with sore red eyes. Preferable to entrusting yourself to a stranger -I always feel too vulnerable for that at our level of uncorrected vision. As  you say you can just manage to see one spot if you manage to get your eyes to it but never the whole picture! </p><p>At my age it's not that much of an issue anymore unfortunately.  </p><p> </p><p>My ex partner however was always aroused at my bare eyed peering which led to impromptu sex in some oft repeated and some highly unexpected places- lots of fun and laughs.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;12 Aug 2005, 15:53</p><p>xuy - I've worn prisms for many years out of necessity. </p><p> </p><p>Thickness and look of the glasses depends on many factors: </p><p> </p><p>Size of lens, index of lens, Rx plus or minus, Base Out, Base In, Base Up or Base Down. </p><p> </p><p>I wore 5 BO / 5 BO in a fairly large, CR-39, lenses with an Rx of about -3 and -2,  The prism wes barely noticable except to someone who was a dedicated OO. </p><p> </p><p>The lenses were maybe 2-3 mm thicher at the outer edge than non-prism glasses and there were slightly more pronounced "power rings" on the outer edges.  5 diopters of prism results in about 3 degrees (0.6 degrees per prism diopter)of eye position change and it is almost invisible to anyone other than an eye doctor who is looking and testing for it. </p><p> </p><p>In about 10 years of wearing 5 - 5 BO I only had one comment that my glasses seemed "funny".  I told him I was a little cross-eyed and wore a little prism to fix it.  His reply "Oh, thats interesting.  Can you tell you are wearing prism?  "Only when I take my glasses off." </p><p> </p><p>I now wear 15 - 15 BO.  My experience is that you have to get up to about 10-10 or have more in one eye than the other before it is detectable by non-OOs. </p><p> </p><p>Cactus</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;12 Aug 2005, 08:17</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Stuart, </p><p> </p><p>No, I haven't ordered my readers yet. I'm waiting to hear how you like yours before I do! I want to hear about your online experience.  Optical4Less is half of what I would pay at a discount place here which does specialize in all of the high-index lenses.  And thanks, Wayne, for checklng out the viewage as a -4.  I'll be curious to know how you do, Stuart.   </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, I'm glad that your partner liked you without your glasses between the sheets.  I have always been a "face man" so have always found that component to be highly important to my sexual enjoyment.  When I'm bareeyed, I always have to get a mental imprint of the fellow's look before I slip off my glasses.  As you know, Stuart, no matter how close we get we still can't see somebody clearly.  If I am close enough to see something clearly (e.g., eyes) then I'm too close to see the balance of their face.  Oh, well.  Still, being completely and utterly myopic can be very exciting if one is with somebody one trusts.  Recently I was with a hunky Puerto Rican insurance executive who may have been a -1.  He rather cheekily removed my glasses along with his own and placed them on a nearby table.  I never let on just how blind I am without them but asked him where they were afterwards.  He pointed in their general direction, and I had to ask him to hand them to me since I couldn't see that far.  He was so surprised (again one of these people who have no clue about lens strength) and asked me how I could function.  (He wasn't being rude, only genuinely inquisitive), and I told him that I could function quite well -- after all, hadn't I spotted him (fuzzily) across the room at the bar where we were both having a drink.  I did point out to him, however, that I basically see with glasses the way he sees without as a -1. </p><p>When he asked me if he could try my glasses on, I said sure.  Boy was he surprised at their strength then.  He asked how he looked in them, and I had to confess that I couldn't tell, although I wished I could have so I could have checked out the visibility of the myodiscs on another person. Again, this total incomprehension.  I think he is now more appreciative of highly myopic people today than he was before we met. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stuart  </b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2005, 23:43</p><p>Wayne  </p><p> </p><p>Thank you now I am really having a good laugh but will refrain form further appropriate comments.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2005, 23:16</p><p>Oops.  I got things a little mixed up.  Stuart has the new reading glasses, PatrickB suggested the issue of reading as a -4 myope and Stuart had the boyfriend who liked him bare-eyed in bed.  Not sure how I got Tinyeyes in there.  He has the new spexy boyfriend but I didn't talk about this. </p><p> </p><p>Chalk it up to the fact that I have poor eyesight ;-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2005, 23:05</p><p>PatrickB, </p><p> </p><p>I just tested Tinyeyes point about reading as a -4 myope.  My right eye is currently -4.  I couldn't read something sitting on my desk without leaning forward but if I pick the paper up I can read it at a distance that wouldn't be too embarrasing, about 12 inches.  With my -5.5 left eye, I have to hold the paper about 9.5 inches away.  My measurements were very inexact (a tape measure between my eyelid and the paper). </p><p> </p><p>As for glasses during sex, my preference is like your former partner, the bare-eyed myopic peering really turns me on.  I really like it when a guy leans close to see me.  I want to tell him "just keep in in plain sight."  I'm sometimes a little selfish as I used to like to keep my glasses on to see the other guy (less so, now that I'm down to -4).  I remember doing this with a guy some years ago.  Without his glasses he didn't realize I was wearing mine.  When he leaned closer and noticed this he told me I was cheating.  I guess I was.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stuart</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2005, 18:20</p><p>Watcher </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes advice is spot on- if you don't like it don't read it -it couldn't be simpler!! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stuart  </b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2005, 18:17</p><p>Patrick B </p><p> </p><p>The proof will be in the wearing and ia m being optimistic!!. In the office I will be able to swap if needed but it is mainly when I visit clients that I find it awkward. At the moment if I have to read something I simply pretend that I can read it with my new glasses and I will be caught out. Heavens my clients could have a field day and I could sign off on any charge rate. Have you ordered a pair of "readers" as you were intending? I have ordered mine on line so I will probably need to wait. I appreciate your calcualtions re my Rx with the new readers - it reduces it to a quantity that I can understand and mathematically I am hopeless. </p><p>  </p><p>Regarding the discussion re sex my former partner of more than 12 years always found my bare eyed myopic peering a turn on rather than my wearing my glasses. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2005, 14:23</p><p>I'll let you know what happens with Nick, if it does.  We are just going out on dates right now.... not sure where it will go.  I find him very sexy, but there has to be more than that, and I'm not sure if there is or not yet.  But so far so good.  One problem with the guy is that he usually has to come over to my place if we're going to hang out, because he has a roommate.  So, if he doesn't wear his glasses, they're not even an option.  But as you say -- as problems go, it could be worse --- at least he is super cute and a high myope --- getting him to wear the spex (especially for sex) is something to look forward to!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>PatrickB</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2005, 08:39</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Stuart, </p><p> </p><p>It will be interesting to see if you can function efficiently with your "readers"  If you are now seeing at approximatley 20/30 or 40 fully corrected you will probably see like an uncorrected -3.5 to -4 myope -- perhaps in the 20/150 range which is manageaable, I suppose, so long as no serious visual demands are put on you, e.g., watching a video.  I'll be curious how you get along with that.  A -4 would probably hold papers a bit closer to read, but certainly it might be better than switching to another pair of specs or, certinly, holding reading material within an inch of one's eye and having to close the other.  Let us know how it goes. </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>Yes, so few do really know about lens strength.  Frankly, I do enjoy sex with high myopes since they never queston why I prefer to wear glasses to bed and usually want to do so themselves. Happened recently with a -6 who asked me if he could keep his glasses on.  Of course, I responded in the affirmative! </p><p>As for Nick, Tinyeyes, we're all hoping for the best.  You sound like a really nice guy and should have a terrific boyfriend.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2005, 07:26</p><p>Watcher, I don't know what your interest in this forum is, but most of the people on Eyescene do have more than an academic interest in glasses -- that is, they have a glasses fetish. I started the Guys in Glasses thread because 90% of the activity on Eyescene is straight men talking about women in glasses.  So this is a place for people (whether men or women) who like guys in glasses. It would be tempting to go ahead and call it in "Gays in Glasses" as you say, but we wouldn't want to exclude the women who are part of this community. If you don't want to be part of a community with gay men, you don't have to read these postings.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2005, 16:10</p><p>One more thought.  I'm curious about early onset presbyopia.  I knew a guy in his twenties years ago who had to get reading glasses -- it wasn't due to hyperopia but to presbyopia.  I've often seen even young children wearing bifocals.  If they're nearsighted, this is usually an attempt to slow the progression of their myopia. </p><p> </p><p>But what about young kids with bifocals in their plus glasses?  I remember seeing a young kid on the subway in New York City wearing plus bifocals.  Someone was showing him something close, but not reading distance.  He immediately looked through the bifocal part to see it, still couldn't and pulled it closer to him.  I'm assuming he really needed trifocals. </p><p> </p><p>I've always been more interested in guys wearing minus glasses.  When I was young, the guys I'd see wearing even fairly strong looking plus glasses seemed to be able to manage quite well without them for anything but reading.  But the guys with even moderate myopia would be squinting unable to recognize someone across the room, etc. </p><p> </p><p>I'm beginning to realize as I get older that after a certain age, hyperopes can be more handicapped than myopes being unable to see near or far.  We myopes can at least lean close to see something.  (Of course, if one is so nearsighted he has to get within a couple of inches to see, the difference hardly matters.) </p><p> </p><p>I remember watching a late teen playing basketball while wearing very thick looking plus glasses.  They kept falling off his face so he just stuck them in his pocket and continued to play.  The kids playing with him were surprise he could still see well enough to play because the glasses looked so thick -- this was before hi-index and aspheric lenses. </p><p> </p><p>I'm curious about what it's like to be farsighted. You hyperopes, what do things look like when you take off your glasses?  How farsighted do you have to be before distance as well as close work is effected (before presbyopia)?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2005, 15:42</p><p>I like how active this thread is getting.  Regarding the presbyopia discussion.  The noticable onset is usually in the early 40's but can vary.  I've know people who didn't need bifocals or reading glasses until they were 50 and others who started in their late 30's. </p><p> </p><p>Actually, presbyopia starts earlier.  By your late twenties you usually don't have the power of accomodation that you did in your teens -- although usually more than enough to read fine print, so you don't notice it. </p><p> </p><p>When presbyopia becomes noticable, low myopes (-4 or less) often stave off getting bifocals by simply taking off their glasses to read. </p><p> </p><p>Hyperopes, however begin to have a new problem.  Where previously they might have been able to manage distance without their glasses by accomodating (resulting in headaches from the strain) they now find it difficult to see near or far without glasses.   </p><p> </p><p>I remember a guy in his middle thirties when i was working in the auto plants in Detroit years ago. He wore fairly strong plus glasses.  When he took his glasses off to shower he'd get this strained look in his eyes as he gazed into the distance -- obviously trying to accomodate enough to see distance.  I call it the hyperopic stare -- quite different from the blank look myopic stare.  (I try to sneak in a sighting to keep us on topic :-) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2005, 09:12</p><p>Bander - I think BVD is base vertex distance, which is the distance between your eye and the lens that they tested you at, and so your glasses have to be the same. With the split prism I think it means that instead of giving you 14 prism dioptres base out in your left eye, they will give you 7 in each, which will have the same effect but make the lenses look more even - and the same with the 8 base up prism - 4 up in the right and 4 down in the left. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2005, 08:11</p><p>Regarding Nick--- you're right, Julian, no news is good news. We are getting together again, don't worry.  My main worry is that the guy is too good to be true -- extremely handsome, extremely nearsighted, AND he wants to go out with me!  How long can this possibly work out?  Oh well, I'm going along for the ride! </p><p> </p><p>Patrick, </p><p>You keep mentioning how people don't notice the strength of your RX.  I never realized how true this is!  How about this? I went to the eye doctor yesterday, and showed up in my -8 specs.  He asked me what my power was before he tested me!  Was this just to be nice, or could he really not tell?  Because if someone walked in wearing my glasses, I would instantly know they were a high myope.  he didn't seem to have any idea until he started testing me.  Am I better at figuring out an RX visually than an optometrist!? Maybe I should change careers!  By the way, the eye doctor was cute, if anyone's interested, and had rimless glasses that were maybe -3.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2005, 07:57</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>I agree with Julian re presbyopia.  You'll know it when you get it! In some people it can almost come on overnight. </p><p>Glad that your exam worked out well and that you're getting new contact lenses.  You probably should have done this a while ago.  Keep us posted on the Nick front. </p><p> </p><p>Stuart, </p><p> </p><p>I really don't like driving but continue to do so out of basic necessity.  I do find the negative carriers of my myodiscs do help somewhat when my eyes stray from the bowls which they do more frequently when I'm driving.  At least there isn't that offputting total blur when I do look through the carrier portion of the lenses.  Interesting tale with the -6 and reassuring that most people don't know just how strong our glasses are.  Yesterday at lunch I was reading the newspaper with my glasses pulled down my nose enough for close up comfort but too much for me to see clearly across the cafe.  An MD I know slightly was apparently sitting off in the blur and had given me a nod which I couldn't see.  He stopped by my table and jocularly told me that I must be quite the snob not to have waved to him.  What else could I do but tell him that I couldn't see him across the room with my glasses pulled down my nose a bit for reading.  He's at most a -2, and he then regaled me with stories of his "poor" vision and said that we both had that in common.  Eh, gads, the guy's a doctor and didn't even notice the obvious strength of my prescription.  Let me know how much you enjoy your new readers.  What is the "add"?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2005, 04:09</p><p>Tinyeyes: they're all determined you have to be presbyopic, aren't they? Actually DWV's suggestion is sound when you do get significant problems with small print. But it puts me in mind of when I went for a test at the age of 40 and the optometrist gave me a spiel which began "The time is rapidly approaching..." you can guess the rest. I opted for bifocals right away, so as to be used to them before presbyopia really began to bite. Unfortunately I went for the executive type which, with glass lenses, were very heavy as the upper part (with my plus Rx) had to be made thicker... </p><p>By the way you've gone very quiet about Nick. I hope no news is good news.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bander</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2005, 03:20</p><p>Had my eye test yesterday - very "cuddly" eye doc - but didn't wear specs. Have an increase of -1.00 and -1.25 and more cyls and a change of prism. Test took quite a long time- which I didn't mind. My new Rx is  RE - -11.00 -4.75 Cyl x 125 8prism - base UP: LE - -11.75 -5.25Cyl x 45 14prism - base out. </p><p>He also made some notes on the form - "BVD" (i think) 15mm and "split prism R&amp;L;" - Anyone know what this means? There was a lot of "technical chat". with the dispenser about fitting these lenses in the frame I chose. Can't wait to get my new specs. </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DWV</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2005, 00:44</p><p>Well, that is a sign that presbyopia is closing in.  You could try a pair of drugstore reading glasses in +1 over your contacts when reading for extended periods or doing close work.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wei</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2005, 00:25</p><p>tinyeyes - I glad you not need myodisc, -8 not too high rx I think.  hope you well with new contact. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2005, 00:03</p><p>Thanks, but I don't think I'm at that point yet.  I can read just fine.  I only have trouble with VERY fine print in very dim light, but it's almost always when I have contacts in, so I can't really take them out.  I can read it, but it is a little difficult sometimes. I mean super fine print, like smaller than a phone book or a very small medicine bottle or something liket that.  I have seen people who take their glasses off to read all the time, and that's not me at all.  Not yet!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DWV</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2005, 23:51</p><p>tinyeyes: </p><p>By the time I was 38, I'd started taking off my glasses to read fine print especially in bad light, so I mentioned that to the ophthalmologist during the eye exam.  He said something condescending about me not being ready for bifocals and didn't even bother to check my near vision.  About a year later I went to an optometrist, mentioned right off that I was having trouble with near vision, he did the near test, and I got +1.00.  At 43, the add was bumped to 1.50. </p><p>There's various ways of checking near vision, but AFAIK the most common (and probably best) is for the doc to put a card on a stick at a typical reading distance (40 cm) from your eyes, then gradually increase the add (changing lenses on the phoroptor or trial frame) until you say there's no longer any improvement. </p><p>So, anyway, just tell the eye doc you're having trouble with near vision, fine print, poor light, headaches or eyestrain after extended reading, and you've got a good chance of receiving a near add.  </p><p>Or just write or Photoshop in a 1.00 or 100 (depending on how your RX was written) in the "Add" column of your prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2005, 19:44</p><p>Also, It's interesting given all the bifocal talk. I'm going to be 38 years old later this month, but the eye doc didn't say anything about near vision or bifocals. I assume he checked my near vision (I hope so.)  I guess I don't have any complaints anyway in that department, although as I have said before, really fine print is harder to read than when I was younger.  I guess I am not ready for bifocals.  This is a very individual thing, isn't it?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2005, 19:31</p><p>Well, I had my eye exam. The eye doc was nice.  He didn't think -8 seemed to be a high RX at all. He said he has lots of patients who are -12 and -14. (He is Chinese and has lots of Chinese patients -- maybe that means he has more high myopic patients?)  Anyway, he agreed that it was important that I stopped wearing the contacts for a couple of days because they were affecting my vision with glasses and my uncorrected vision.  But he didn't seem to be worried about my eye health at all. He was very nonchalant.  He did say that my contacts were very scratched up and old and really needed replacing.  As far as the RX, I don't think it really changed much at all. In fact, he measured the RX of my glasses to check his figures, and it seemed to agree.  For some reason, the astigmatism in my left eye is always challenging to correct, and he ran into this problem.  The new RGPs will be in either Thursday or next Tuesday, so I'm looking forward to that.  Apparently my eyeglass RX is fine, so no new glasses right now (I can't afford it anyway).   I guess my eyes are relatively healthy, just irritated. But I'm glad I took care of this.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cooper</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2005, 15:59</p><p>Ricky--glad that you had your eyes examined. +2.00 bifocal should make quite a difference in reading near point.  I bet your eyes will love the relief!   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stuart  </b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2005, 15:26</p><p> </p><p>Patrick B </p><p> </p><p>I do have a current drivers license but made the decision quite some years ago not to drive any more. The decison was based on a dislike of driving, 3 smallish accidents in a row accident (not all vision related) and my less than perfect eyesight.   </p><p> </p><p>I am happy (in an inperfect world) with the myodiscs. They fit comfortably and it still stuns me how very few people realise the strength and special nature of the lenses. I had a picture in my mind of receiving many pitying( I hate pity)looks but with the blended myodisc that is fortunately not the case. Probably woth a non blended it would be a different story. </p><p> </p><p>I ordered prescription sunglasses some years ago from our equivalent of Lenscrafters. I selected designer frames and ordered. I waited a fortnight and then followed up on a few occasions. Eventually they called back another week later to say that they were unable to make the lenses at that prescription (around -20 non myo)to fit that frame. Hopeless. This time I tried again as they have a reasonable selection of frames and are conveniently located. I showed the shop assistant ( not optometrist) my prescription and explained that I only wanted to order suitable frames and would then come back to have the lenses fitted (the doctor was ordering the lenses). She obviously had no understanding at all of my prescription and grinned and said that she had never seen anyone with eyesight as poor as mine.  I walked out and will not return. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoff</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2005, 15:10</p><p>Hi Rick---congrats for joining us in the bifocal club.  Will be interested in hearing about your adjustments to multi-focal glasses.  Your prescription has an "add" of +2.00?  I think that add will be of great benefit to you in close-up work and being able to read without taking off your specs.  You'll be pleased with the decision to move into bifocals.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2005, 14:39</p><p>Wei--  </p><p> </p><p>No, I don't wear myodisc. I am only around -8 so it's not needed.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2005, 10:25</p><p>OK, I'm taking care of my eyes too, like everyone else seems to be on here!  I have still been having trouble with my RGP contacts, and spectacle blur in my left eye.  I have not worn my contacts for two days, and the spectacle blur has pretty much disappeared.  So, I called around and managed to get an appointment with a doctor who sounds good this afternoon. I spoke to him on the phone and he sounded like a good doctor.  I hope he lets me keep wearing contacts!  Although actually, wearing glasses for 2 days hasn't been all that bad!  I'll give  a report when I get back.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2005, 08:11</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Stuart, </p><p> </p><p>So you had a similar LensCrafters experience.  I nearly consider it unethical behavior on their part to sell high prescription glasses without advising a client that the lens materials they use aren't ideal for prescriptions above a certain level.  Some chain optical dispensers are at least honest and won't do lenses in excess of -12 since they haven't got the skill set or the desire to stock unusual (and expensive) lenses.  Yes, most people -- even high myopes -- don't know super high prescriptions when they see them.  How are you doing with your myodiscs?  I was going to ask you if you are corrected enough to drive a car.  I do drive with my myodiscs but generally don't at night.</p><p></p><hr>

I also have prisms and I know that I now have a problem with keeping everything merged into one - especially when driving. I am getting quite excited - will let you know the outcome. </p><p>Cheers</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2005, 03:47</p><p>I have come back from the optican. I had the eye test today. The OD rx was the same. OS the astigmatism was the same. Sphere was -10.50 which is up from -10.00. So my eye sight is more stable than it has been which is good. </p><p>I talked about reading cause the print is small and it is a strain. I can focus so it is not like my eyes are old. Asked if bifocals would help. The opticiansays sometimes it does. So he tried some plus lens with the reading chart. Certainly it made reading better. This was with an add of +2.00. </p><p>As the reading area is bigger and the distortion less i decided on bifocal and not progressive. With my rx the line shouldn't show much. I also asked the difference between 28mm and 35mm. Its a personnal choice. Some people like one. Some the other. If your work means alot of reading and figures a larger bifocal may be better. </p><p>I have decided to order the 35mm bifocal. The new frames are like my present ones. That is  dark gun metal quite square frames not too big. I will get them sometime next week. Probably Thursday or Friday. So will know if they work for me then. I'll also then have the lens changed in my present glasses so I'll have single vision glasses also.  </p><p>So thanks for all your advise you guys. Hope it all works out cause the lens are expensive.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;07 Aug 2005, 20:50</p><p>Lentifan, Unless he's a real budding oo, I doubt very much that the young man I saw wanted his glasses to be that thick. I imagine he just assumed that because his eyesight was so bad, he had to have thick glasses. The thickness on each side was way out of propotion and really stuck out.  I probably underestimated the dimension I quoted.  Also, -8 was a conservative estimation on my part of his rx.  I think even -8 hi-index lenses that large would be unlikely to appear thin or insubstantial. I'm more inclined to agree with Patrick B's comments.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;07 Aug 2005, 18:20</p><p>Geoff </p><p>I don't know. I'm going to get my eye test and ask about bifocal but I don't know if I need them or they will help me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;07 Aug 2005, 16:07</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wayne, </p><p> </p><p>Missed your last post.  Yes, so many people are clueless -- even those who work in the vision business!  Poor kid.  When you're that age and just beginning to think of girls (boys?) you want to look good.  And what could be worse than thick, style-free glasses.  Something appropriate for his age, face and prescription could be produced that could make the boy a hottie.  But as I have long been saying, most people are visual illiterates.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;07 Aug 2005, 16:05</p><p>Wayne </p><p>Maybe the young mam you saw WANTED a thick ede to his rumless glasses.  In my opinion, high index lenses of relatively low power in rimless glasses can look rather thin and insubstantial. A more chunky appearance looks much better and a relatively high Rx gives a nice sparkle to the eyes.  At least that's how it appears to me with ladies.  I should think the same considerations apply with guys.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;07 Aug 2005, 16:02</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wayne, </p><p> </p><p>Good advice.  I've offered the same to Thomas and Wei in earlier posts. When people get to some extreme prescriptions, I don't think most optometrists are really prepared to do the research that it takes to determine the best combination of frames, lenses and/or contacts.  Too many optometrists work for companies like LensCrafters which are fine for 95% of the prescriptions they face.  They're not set up for unusual visual requirements, and, I suspect, on-site, independent optometrists are discouraged by companies like LensCrafters from spending the necessary time to figure out what is best for an unusual patient. My last pair of glasses from LensCrafters was a disaster. (The reason I had gone was that someone had given me a gift certificate they couldn't use).  They were -22/23, and I was assured that they could do them with no problem.  You should have seen what they produced!  The first pair (which I instantly returned) was produced with the incorrect prescription (the lenses were one diopter too weak) and, to add insult to injury, they were so crudely finished they looked like something that would have been provided to someone in an insane asylum where cosmetic considerations are of no tremendous importance.  The final pair was somewhat better but not anything I would wear in public.  The highest index lens material they use is a 1.67 which is completely unsuitable for a high prescription, and they didn't do myodisc lenses at all.  Places like that are a real mill.  </p><p> </p><p>Best to go to specialists who deal with high myopes and other patients with low vision problems on a daily basis.  They're in the know and can provide the answers to the most unusual of questions.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;07 Aug 2005, 15:55</p><p>And now a sighting.  I saw a young man (probably 15 or 16) outside a movie theater yesterday -- well built in a chuncky sort of way.  He was wearing fairly large rimless glasses.  The lenses were quite strong, I'd say -8 anyway and they weren't hi-index.  Without any frame to disguise any of it the edge thickness was very noticable.  He, his parents and/or his optical dispenser must be clueless. Even if hi-index lenses were not affordable for him a better frame for that strong rx could have been chosen. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;07 Aug 2005, 15:02</p><p>Wei,  You've mentioned a few times that your doctor doesn't explain things to you and doesn't answer your questions.  I'd find a new doctor if I were you.  I always search out doctors who explain things to me, answer my questions and listen to me -- the doctor has the medical expertise but it's my body;  I've been living in it for some time now and I'm intimately familiar with it. </p><p> </p><p>A lot of doctors do "assembly line" medicine and don't want to spend the necessary time with a patient.  I'm fortunate to have found an optometrist, and opthamologist and a general physicial (DO not MD) who will work with me. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;07 Aug 2005, 14:52</p><p>Haven't been on for a couple of weeks and things seem to have been very active while I was gone.   </p><p> </p><p>Some comments of discussions that I missed: </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, I'd think you wouldn't have a problem wearing soft contacts unless you have significant astigmatism -- that would require toric contacts which I understand are more difficult to fit.  I have a friend who's -8.  He wears extended wear soft contacts.  He leaves them in (day &amp; night) for 6 days, then wears glasses for one day. </p><p> </p><p>Personally, I prefer GP contacts over soft.  Soft are very comfortable when you first put them in but I find that they become uncomfortable much sooner than GP's, probably because my dry eyes suck the water out of the soft ones. </p><p> </p><p>As for -8 glasses.  My friend has a very attractive and flattering pair of glasses -- small frame that suits his face perfectly, very hi-index lenses.  There's a tiny bit of edge thickness that only an oo would notice.  His only complaint about his glasses is the minification.  I think he's especially aware of this because he wears contacts most of the time.  He will sometimes take his glasses off and lean close to judge the size of something he's about to purchase.  He has no difficulty reading or working at the computer, however. </p><p> </p><p>Regarding the discussion of bi/trifocals versus progressives.  I much perfer progressives.  Aside from a cosmetic improvement, I like the full range of vision. The reading rx is at the bottom and the rx gradually shifts through midrange to the distance rx in the top half.  They don't work well with a very small frame.  I'd guess they may not work well with the very high rx's and especially myodisks (the highest my rx has been is -7-6.

And a cross between Ethan Hawke (who's fab in his own strong glasses) and Tom Cruise.  My heart be still.  You've got a number of sisters who are who anxiously await futher details from LA. </p><p> </p><p>You're not the only one who is so into glasses that they almost become a prerequisite.  Let a guy pick me up several weeks ago at the Lone Star (in SF) who was very sexy but not terribly good-looking.  What sealed the deal were the -5/6 glasses which he only took off when he rolled over to go to sleep.  Total turn-on.  At a cocktail party last night there was a hunky 38 year old cop who really rattled my cage especially when he started complaining about his contacts.  Would I love to see him in the buff just wearing thick specs. </p><p> </p><p>Have fun tonight.  I'd light a candle but you seem to have matters well in hand! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wei</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2005, 10:47</p><p>Thank you for reply on myodisc Patrick B.  Yes I see picture on myodisc and lens look regular so I hopeful my glasses look good.  I so dismayed I cannot where nice glasses sometimes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2005, 10:28</p><p>Yes, he is a hot date, Patrick.  I hope things go well and I can continue to see him.  You're probably right that he might not feel comfortable talking too much about his vision.  Even though I let him know I have bad vision, I didn't elaborate on it, and he probably hears that all the time from people, and figures he is much more nearsighted than anyone else he's with (because that's usually true!)  So, he might be surprised when he finds out I'm in the same "diopter department" as him!  On the other hand, he doesn't have any hangups about wearing his glasses because he wore them for our entire date, which included going to a movie.   </p><p> </p><p>I did get one hint about his vision on our first date, but it threw me off.  He came over to my house (in contacts, I now realize) and we were gazing out at the view from my window. From my window you can see an old theatre with a neon sign.  Nick couldn't read it and asked me what it said. I can't really read it either, but I know what it says, so I told him, and mentioned it was fuzzy to me too.  He said something like "I'm getting old and can't see".   That made me think he was probably slightly myopic and not wearing correction at all.  I was way off -- he's actually really myopic and not corrected perfectly, like me!  I didn't mention my contacts that night, so the subject didn't come up until this week when he showed up in glasses, revealing his high myopia. He's supposed to come over tonight --  so we'll see what happens next.  You're right --- it's a fun "problem" to have, getting Nick to wear his glasses!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2005, 10:12</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wei, </p><p> </p><p>Most people only notice lens thickness so the myodiscs will seem less powerful to the majority of people you will encounter. For the few of us who care about these matters, the myodisc would  </p><p>be readily apparent, and we would know that it means a very high minus prescription.  Let us know how it goes. </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>What a hot date!  You must be in optical obsessive heaven.  I think you're very wise not to push the subject of glasses too much with Nick; I suspect that he might be a bit sensitive on the subject and hopes that you are part of the majority that simply doesn't know just how strong his glasses are.  A lot of high myopes don't like anyone to know how blind they are without correction.  I think it makes some feel vulnerable. Even I feel the need to fake it on occasion by taking off my glasses when I'm in a conversation or whatever, things that don't need any meaningful vision. As I said in an earlier post that works out fine until the bartender moves your drink, and you can't see where it's gone!  It's a bit embarrassing to have to put on your glasses to see a drink only a foot away from you in a dark bar! </p><p> </p><p>You might want to figure out how to introduce your own thick glasses into the equation.  If he sees you wearing yours then perhaps he will continue to wear his.  Perhaps some night when you both are watching a DVD, you can complain that your contacts are killing you and you need to get them out and put on your glasses.  Be very nonchalant about it and let him do all (if any) of the talking.  It'd be wonderful to see if he would open up a bit and talk about his own vision. Even if he doesn't say anything about your glasses (or his) you can be certain that he'll notice your own high minus prescription and will certainly wonder if it is at or about his own in strength. Don't press it if the subject of eyesight seems to be a sore one.  In time he'll open up. Anyone, you've got a lovely "problem" to sort out.  Good luck!! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2005, 00:33</p><p>I am a lucky OO tonight.  I had my second date tonight with someone I met recently online who I'll call Nick. Nick is a really cute caucasian guy in his 30s who's new in town. He looks sort of like a cross between Ethan Hawke and Tom Cruise. But, being the OO that I am (which may not be healthiest thing at times) I wasn't sure how interested I was in Nick, because he didn't wear glasses the first time we met (coffee date) or the second time (first date.)  My fetish is so strng that I really need for a guy to be nearsighted if I'm going to date him.  Did he wear contacts?  I try to figure these things out, but I'm terrible at it. I really wasn't sure.  Even if he did, I was guessing Nick's RX would be pretty low.  </p><p> </p><p>Well, BOY was I wrong.  I went to pick Nick up at his house tonight, and cute, stylish, masculine, tousled hair Nick answered the door TINYEYED. Yes, Nick was wearing a pair of quite strong high minus glasses!  I was really surprised and really distracted, as he gave me a kiss and invited me in to show me around and meet his roommate.  I couldn't keep from looking at Nick's glasses.  The particulars:  small, stylish rectangular brown plastic frames, thin high index lenses with just a little edge peeking out of the frame, flat fronts, and VERY small eyes with deep cut-in.  WOW!  He's a very good looking guy in contacts, but this is really remarkable.  His RX:  I'm not exactly sure yet, but it's at least as strong as mine, and possible a minus nine or maybe even a ten.  </p><p> </p><p>On the way to dinner, I told Nick that he looked great tonight and that I really liked his glasses. He said he took his contacts out after work today because his eyes were bothering him --- the air here is very dry and he's still getting used to it.  He told me he's worn contacts since age 15 and he wears disposables.  That was about it for the glasses conversation.  But I really enjoyed the way Nick took his glasses off several times during dinner and rubbed his eyes. He didn't even try to look at ANYTHING without his glasses-- just rubbed his eyes put the glasses right back on before trying to look at anything, including me right across the table from him.   </p><p> </p><p>There is DEFINITELY going to be a third date! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2005, 15:34</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>Basically I think most people are visually illiterate and see surprisngly little whether it's architecture, good interior design or whatever. Yes, my old -22/23s would not go unnoticed by even the most out-of-it person since they are so thick and the cut-in is so unbelievably apparent. I'm never publicly seen in those! But my new lenses are far more subtle re strength and only appreciated by those who know just what they represent.  For example, I saw two men today with prescriptions north of -12.  One was a south Asian (not bad looking) who sported a very expensive semi-rimless frame and lenses with lots of compressed power rings.  He really moved his head a lot to see through the dead center of his lenses as he waited to cross the street indicating his total lack of decent peripheral vision. Another guy (only ten minutes later) was walking with his obvious brother.  Neither were especially good-looking (around 30, I would say) but the one wearing glasses had that plano-fronted flash which caught my attention.  His lenses were noticeably thick and could easily have been -13.  In short, I'll bet that fewer than a handful of people would notice their lens strength and many might be pressed to remember if they even wore glasses if asked to describe either of them.  But when you're spotted by an oo, boy do you know it.  Now that I'm wearing these myos so much more I really got a repeated look from someone I see at the gym.  I could tell he was checking out my glasses, because I do the same thing to others and do it in the same semi-surreptitious way.  He is a rather good-looking straight fellow with dark hair and is around a -2.  Sometimes he doesn't wear contacts or glasses when he works out and squints a bit to see the television.  He was clearly interested since he has never looked in my direction before and had a hard time taking his eyes off of me.  </p><p> </p><p>I'll bet you look quite good in those -8s, but still have some residual hangup from when you were young and never wore them.  Too, you're certainly right about Los Angeles, home of vanity.  Why don't you wear them a couple of times to a gay bar/gym that you normally don't frequent and see if your success rate is reduced by them.  I'll bet it isn't!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2005, 14:04</p><p>That's a funny experience you had with your -8 friend. I guess most people are oblivious to this stuff.   I am so self-conscious about my -8 glasses, and I feel funny wearing them in public, but in reality, are you saying that most people don't know the difference between my -8s and a pair of -1s?  I think that's somewhat true, but not always. I think some people have an idea, but the newer lenses are making it more and more difficult to detect a strong prescription. I think the average person picks up on very thick lenses, concentric rings, and that kind of thing, but maybe not so much on the minified eyes, cut-in, and other things we OOs notice.  Of course,, when people try on a strong pair of glasses, they can usually tell right away that they're strong, even if they have 20/20 vision, don't you think?     </p><p> </p><p>But whether becuause of vanity or a desire for good vision, higher myopes seem to be much less likely to go out in public with glasses on, if they have contacts available.  At least it seems that way to me. Here in L.A., you go to a gay bar, you might see plenty of stylish -1 and -2 glasses on guys, but if there are -8 guys, they are almost certain to be wearing contacts.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2005, 10:51</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>Sounds as if you're doing the right thing.  Everybody is different, but a periodic look at your eyes by an MD rather than an OD is probably a good thing to do, even though your myopia is pretty low by some of our standards.  HA!  I have always noted how little people observe when it comes to lens strength and had another verification of my theory yesterday.  I had to meet an out-of town colleagues associate for lunch, and I wore my myodisc glasses.  He was a rather nice-looking prep, a bit long in the tooth but then so I am.  Anyway, he had on these -7/8 Oliver Peoples specs which were plano-fronted and had a reading segment.  They weren't especially thick in their small roundish frames, but I knew straight away that he was quite nearsighted.  I complimented him on his glasses, and he offered to let me try them on.  He said I looked great in them but then stated that I probably couldn't see a thing with his high prescription.  Well, he was right about one thing:  I could only see a bit better with his glasses on since his prescription is only one/third the strength of mine.  When I told him that he was so surprised.  Now here is a guy who has probably been wearing glasses for 40 years, has a relatively high prescription looking across a very small table at somebody with fairly thick biconcave myodiscs with very small eyes and he couldn't figure out that I'm truly as blind as a bat.  Go figure!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>(Original) Geoff</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2005, 16:51</p><p>Patrick B, you can add Multifocals for Presbyopia and other conditions, and Hyperopia and Presbyopia Progression to the list of threads where these discussions could have been! </p><p> </p><p>Ricky, if you decide to go for bifocals instead of progressives, you should ask about getting FT-35 lenses instead of the usual FT-28s.  What that means is that the reading segment in the lens is wider (35mm across instead 28).  I switched from 28s to 35s last time and I found they are way better for like when you are working at your desk, the wider reading area means you can see a way bigger area on the desk without moving your head, which could be really helpful for you if you have a lot of papers spread out on your desk at once.  Brian-16 who has posted a lot on the board has 35s also (only his are trifocals) and he seems to really like them too. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2005, 15:09</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>Forgot to mention your question (once again in the wrong thread)re contact lenses.  Why don't you check out a serious vision center at a teaching hospital/university?  Your myopia, while serious, is probably at the bottom of what a high myopia clinic would work with, but why not give it a try.  I advised the same to young Thomas and suggested that he go to Moorfields in London to get some proper advice from people who work with high myopes on a daily basis. So many optometrists are so involved with mundane prescriptions and basic issues that I fear many of them simply don't know what is out there in terms of the latest lens materials etc. Can't imagine why Thomas's optom had him in such a large frame and 1.7s when better lens materials (1.8/1.9 high index)are available. It's also curious that he didn't have him in bifocals a long time ago. As for myodiscs, when someone is nearly -20 and increasing it is something that needs to be discussed post haste. I think Wei has that problem as well.  I really can't imagine why an eyecare professional wouldn't be fully conversant on the subject of lenticular lenses, for example. While rare, they are out there. Hell, I'm typing this post while looking through them right now!</p><p></p><hr>

Optomologist say this is very rapid increase which of course concern me greatly.  I try tecnique to strengthen eye but alas it has not worked for me.

<p><b>Wei</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2005, 11:30</p><p>To Patrick B.  You give much very good advise.  For so long i confused on what to do to improve my glasses.  I do not understand why optomolgist not mention of myodisc before when I complain my glasses are too heavy.  I think the myodisc look very good.  Yes i worry about aciuty but I understand that this cannot he helped if my rx increase.  My rx increase much in recent years after it slow for some time.  I -6.00 age 15, then am -9.00 at 21 now I -14! I worry I become in peril of degeneraion of eye and go blind.  Optomologist say my eye ok but never to rub eye, I could detach retina. I hope Patrick you eyes in good health.  Kindest wishes from Wei.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2005, 10:14</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wei, </p><p> </p><p>I think you have made a wise choice getting the myodiscs.  You might want to take -14's advice and get a 25mm bowl which will give you a larger viewing area and Stuart's advice to get them in the 1.8 (which both of us have).  Glass is heavier but you should notice an overall decrease in weight from what you are wearing today. When I switched from my non-myodisc 1.7 lenses to the 1.8 myodiscs, I noticed not only a decrease in weight but an appreciable decrease in lens thickness even with a stronger prescription and the negative carriers.  My 1.7 lenses (-23/-24) were originally so thick that I had the edges cut down. This made the side view less awful, but the chamfered edges really showed from head on. Your prescription is very strong but not as strong as mine and if it continues to worsen you will have to wear myodiscs sooner or later.  The general rule is that anything over -20 is best done with this sort of lens so you may as well get used to them now.  And remember that -14's myodiscs are so subtle that an optician was fooled by them.  That wouldn't happen with mine which are 10 diopters stronger, but I do think you will like them much more cosmetically. I do and enjoy having the option of not having to wear contact lenses so much. </p><p> </p><p>Re your concern about visual acuity, everyone is different but Stuart is right about a decline in general visual acuity as one's prescription starts moving into the high double digits.  I don't know what your vision is with your current glasses, but I would suspect that even with your new prescription you will not have perfect 20/20 outside, perhaps, of a doctor's office where the conditions are optimal. Too, no one can predict with any accuracy when myopic increases will stop.  Yours could stop now, but you could also experience increases later in life.  Mine went up five diopters during my twenties and has started to increase once again in my forties.  So long as your vision can be corrected to within 20/40 you will be doing all right.  The important thing is eye health (retinas etc.)and that is what you should monitor closely. </p><p> </p><p>Good luck and let us know how it goes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>(Original) Geoff</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2005, 05:59</p><p>Ricky, I never really had any trouble getting used to wearing bifocals.  It was a bit strange for the first few days, but after that its been no problem.  I got them when my rx was around -6 or -7 and Im around -9 now, so Im sure for -10 or more they would probably be even better.  I never had trifocals but if my add gets much higher (its +2 now) I think I will probably need to.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wei</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2005, 04:52</p><p>I done more research on myodisc and decided to this lens.  I am hopeful it will stop my heavy lens problem and make glasses look good.  I see pictures of myodisc now but I see any one wear myodisc.  Perhaps this is becuase no one can lens if differnt.  I hope so.  For frame choice I will talk on optomolgist but as I say he not productive for much advise.  If you wear myodisc can you say what type of frame you choose?  I like bigger frame but fear this unsuitble for mysodisc.  I will choose witchever frame is better for myodisc even if not to my ideal however.  I research that plano carrier is better for my rx so I will choose this.  The bowl will not be too small I hope.  Many, many thanks for all help so far, you help me greatly.  Please more information is welcomed!!      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stuart </b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2005, 19:11</p><p>Wei </p><p> </p><p>The main benefits from myodiscs is in the weight and thinness of the lenses. </p><p>I believe  those who benefit most are those whose Rx is above -20. Other options for you could be glasses with  high index lenses of 1.8 or 1.9. You would be really surprised at the difference in weight and thickness  as I believe that your current glasses are 1.7. </p><p> </p><p>In my case both visual acuity and close up focussing problems have not been improved by the myodiscs but i was not expecting it. The loss of visual acuity is part and part of a high myope existence and as the Rx increase the less chance you have of 20/20 corrected vision.   </p><p> </p><p>Good luck and let us know what yoiu decide.       </p><p></p><hr>

In checking the lens offerings I noted they offered myodiscs starting at -14 so thought I would give them a try and no they were not suggested by my Optom. I am very pleased with the results. Cosmetically they look like they could be -0.50s. They even fooled my best friend who is an optician. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2005, 15:26</p><p>Wei- </p><p> </p><p>With your RX you probably only use the centres of your present lenses anyway - the rest is lost to distortion. Also with your high RX your lens field of view is quite large so a 25mm bowl (what I have) would be more than adequate. It does take a short adjustment period to get used to the loss of peripheral vision, however. Patrick B could better describe the pros and cons of the different types of carriers. Because I'm "only" -14 the difference in vision between the -14 bowl and the plano carrier is acceptable.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wei</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2005, 15:19</p><p>What RX do myodisc start in?  I am never told about myodisc before.  I think they may be answever to my problems with heavy lens but I never told by optmologist about them so I am thinking they may be difficult to use.  Is there problem with mysodisc i should know before i buy them?  I think will get mysodisc anyway to stop lens getting thicker but I need to consdier this more. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2005, 14:53</p><p>Wei- </p><p> </p><p>I will defer to Patrick B and Stuart as they are the resident experts on myodiscs and can better explain the different types. I will tell you about the myodiscs I have as my RX is closer to yours (-14.25/-14.00) My visual acuity is excellent and the lenses are only 3mm thick and very light so no sore nose. I have regular bowls, not blended, and the carrier is plano, no RX. They were extremely easy to get used to and most people have no idea I am wearing -14 lenses. In fact, I have been asked on several occasions if I had had lasik. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Flick</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2005, 14:46</p><p>Tinyeyes My rx is -6 and 1.00 astig.  I've had RGP for as long as 3 years or so but this too long.  Better replaced every year. I wear glasses not much more than you but am no longer really happy about this as a long term solution to myopia and am considering other options.  It's worked so far but I think there may be better options.  I like glasses but I just find them really irritating for more than a short period.   </p><p> </p><p>    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2005, 13:25</p><p>Thanks Flick and everyone for the advice.  I think it is good advice.  I will try to not wear the lenses for a day or so before the exam if I can.  Now, finding that contact lens specialist -- how do I go about that?  For the most party, I agree with you, Flick, as I have really had minimal problems in all my years of wear.  But I am definitely due for a new pair of RGPs. By the way Flick, are you a high myope?  Also,  how long have you gone with the same pair of contacts? I have gone 5 years or more before --- probably not advisable, but I did it.  The eye doctors have always said my eyes looked relatively healthy, although quite nearsighted.  For the last 15 years, I have always had glasses to wear at night if I want to, and I usually don't put contacts in on the weekend until I leave the house.  So my eyes do get some rest, although they could certainly use more.  </p><p></p><hr>

Perhaps he thought that if he got you to think your looks were impaired by your specs he would have a better chance.  Regardless, it's hard to believe just how rude some people can be. </p><p> </p><p>Hope that problem you're having with your eye is only a temporary one, possibly an allergy.  Let us know how you're doing.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Flick</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2005, 06:59</p><p>Tinyeyes - take out your contacts for as long as possible before you go for your next eye exam.  If your eyes are irritated you could well end up with inaccurate prescription.  At my last eye exam it was mentioned that ideally RGPs should always be taken out at least 48 hours before the exam as they alter the shape of the cornea slightly which obviously could affect the prescription.  No-one had ever said anything about this before though and it's never had any apparent effect on my prescription.   </p><p> </p><p>It sounds as though your contacts are showing signs of ageing and need replacing asap.  I sometimes used to wait too long before getting mine replaced but don't any more and can really feel the benefits.  If you let your contacts get too old the amount of comfortable wearing time drops considerably and you risk harming your eyes as deposits will start building up on the lenses.  Don't jump to the conclusion that your eye irritation is caused by just by overwear in itself,  you may well find (like me) that with new lenses and an extra thorough cleaning regime you can comfortably and safely continue wearing contacts most of the time.  </p><p> </p><p>With regard to the spectacle blur, I'd never worn glasses for 20 years so when I put them on I got some very strange effects!!  After wearing them for a few hours on consecutive days my eyes adjusted and they're fine now.  I don't know how often you wear your glasses but if you only wear them occasionally try wearing whenever you're at home for a few days running. It might just be that your eyes are fully adjusted to them if you don't wear them often.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Flick </b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2005, 06:03</p><p>Re. contact lens "overwear".  I've worn RGP's for 20 years (Since I was 11!). Hated glasses and never owned any (apart from my very first pair which were promptly discarded).  But after every eye test I'm told my eyes are 100% healthy.  Never had eye infection, corneal scratching or any other irritation ever.  Been told I have a good tear film but mainly I put this down to following the cleaning regime to the letter, washed hands twice before handling them and never doing anything stupid like sleeping in them, licking them "clean"  etc.  Also really important to have them replaced regularly and find a contact lens SPECIALIST, who can find the best possible lens for you (not just the to easiest to fit) and will try to find a solution to any CL problems without just telling you to wear your glasses and go away.  Decided glasses are OK now though and bought some earlier this year.  They look OK and I even had a period of wearing them nearly full-time but now the novelty has worn off, I much prefer the better vision and freedom of not having something on my face in order to see clearly.  But, even though the contacts weren't causing problems I'm giving my eyes a break from them a few hours each week to be on the safe side - don't really feel any more than this is necessary, given that my eyes haven't "complained" so far . BTW I don't recommend anyone does the same as me and goes without a backup pair of spex (that was just my dumb hang-up), but I really wanted to emphasise that long term contact lens use isn't inevitably damaging to eyes as long as they're looked after properly and replaced regularly.  Also important to have regular contact lens checks (to catch any problems early) and heed any advice - this way most people should be able to make adjustments to continue wearing contacts at least part-time and not be told they have to completely give up wearing them.  It really annoys me when people give on contacts when they needn't!! I think they're more than worth taking a little bit of trouble over to avoid the annoyingness and limitations of glasses. Also, don't want anyone to think this is critism of anyone posting here, just general comments of my own experience really. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stuart </b>&nbsp;02 Aug 2005, 17:44</p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes/ PatrickB </p><p> </p><p>You have expressed it both succintly and correctly Patrick. Tinyeyes please heed our advice and my experience. The doctor (though he tends to be autocratic and given to sermonizing) does not think that I will be able to wear CLs again. As I type I can feel a fluid seaping from my eye meaning that the infection has re-occured despite 10 weeks of no Cls and several courses of antibiotics. The doctor tells me that worst case scenario peole can become blind in one or both eyes. Watch out for discomfort, weeping eyes and the feeling that the lense is moving and in my case they actually  fellout on several occasions when I tilted my head forwards once into a glass of beer. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoff</b>&nbsp;02 Aug 2005, 16:41</p><p>Rick---you should consult your eye doctor about options concerning bifocals.  By the way, what type of work are you in?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 Aug 2005, 09:26</p><p>Thanks Patrick.  I do give me eyes a rest when I can, and I never sleep in the contacts.  The problem I think is that my lenses need to be replaced because they are causing some discomfort and the spectacle blur on occasion. But, every time I have a problem like that, I prefer to wait, because I don't think I will get an accurate refraction when my eyes are irritated.   </p><p> </p><p>And, even though I'm "only" -8, I am vain. I am embarrassed about the high power of my lenses and that's why I don't wear them "out" much.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;02 Aug 2005, 09:16</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Stuart and Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>I really think that overuse of contact lenses -- whether soft or RGP-- can create a potential longterm visual problem and that eyes need to be rested from time to time. Pay heed, Tinyeyes! I wore mine pretty much 24/7 from thirteen/fourteen until three years ago when I got the blended myodiscs. What a relief! First of all I never had a current prescription for glasses since I didn't want to see how thick they were getting, and even if I did, my vision was never a perfect 20/20 once I climbed over -12.  Minimification was always a bit of an issue but my vanity (Stuart, you're not alone on that front!) really precluded me from wearing such thick lenses.  We're all old enough to remember what a -16 looked like in those days, and I remember getting conventional myodisc glasses when I hit -18 which I only wore when I was alone or perhaps flying on a plane where my contacts would sometimes bother me.  Now those lenses would really get a look (oftentimes of pity).  I once even overheard a woman telling a friend what a shame it was that such a nice-looking young man had to wear such terrible glasses.  At that age when all you've got is sex on the brain you can imagine how a comment like that was received. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, the myodiscs that I have got have a cosmetic quality that makes it a relative pleasure to wear them.  I agree with you, Stuart, that head-on they are nearly invisible and only show if viewed from the side.  Again, most people don't notice them.  I also like the fact that the less powerful negative carrier portion doesn't pull my face in as much sa my old non-myodisc glasses since the bowls with the extra horsepower are situated  right over and around my eyes.  My -12 friend noticed them fairly quickly but then he is fairly hep to visual issues.  The bowls only show when I put them down and then scream unusual and powerful.  Stuart,I, too, had a similar experience to your own.  I had put them down on a client's desk when I was rubbing my eyes and my client asked what type of lenses I had. He's probably a -3/4 and always has the coolest (and expensive ) glasses. I told him all about them, and he was quite interested.  Oh, and Stuart, I know all about cl removal after a few too many! </p><p> </p><p>Keep up your sightings, Tinyeyes, and get thee to an eye doctor.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>TInyeyes</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2005, 23:44</p><p>Stuart, that's interesting. I consider myself warned -- I better be careful, or I may not be able to wear contacts anymore either. Perhaps in the future if you heal up you can wear contacts again?   </p><p> </p><p>As for my story about being uncorrected -- as I said, I'm not sure I was -8 but I must have been somewhere close.  I don't know how I did it either -- it was a long time ago.  I guess when you don't have a choice ( or think you don't have a choice) you do more than you might think with a "disability" like that. </p><p> </p><p>I have been putting off going to the eye doctor. But I better go soon. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stuart </b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2005, 18:35</p><p>Tiny eyes  </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps you will be interested in my myoic progression. When I left school I was probably around the -10 mark. By the time I was in my mid 20's around -12. For the next two decades I increased to around the -16 -17 mark.  </p><p> </p><p>What is unusual is that I have had another round of steeper increases in the last 5 years to my current prescription of 21.75 -4.75 and  </p><p>23.15 -4.50. My astigmnastism has also increased. The doctor says that it is an unusual occurence but assures me that I have none of the problems that can overcome high myopes.  </p><p> </p><p>I wore my first contact lenses in 1974 at -10. and they were horrendously uncomfortable and I did not persist. Other myopes whom I knew by sight at the time also tried but most did not persist. In 1979 I tried again and suffered some discomfort but persisted. </p><p>I then fairly much continuously wore them for over 20 years except at night  </p><p>and when I went to the beach.I did have some amusing mishaps. I have tried all types but becuse of my astigmatsim RGP  </p><p>lenses have been the best. I also tried soft and toric but not with any level of success. About two years ago the problems commenced, my vison was no longer perfect with lenses  and now I have a recurrent infection and the surface of my corneas is scratched. It has been said that my astigmatism has increased due to continally wearing the contacts (how true this is medically I I don't know). I now wear myodiscs all the time. I was so reliant on contacts  that I did not have glasses with a current prescription. For me after  problems of the last 2 years it is a relief. I do not miss the ordeal of putting them in and taking them out (especially after too many cocktails).I do regret that it is an option ie contacts that I no longer have.  </p><p> </p><p>At -8 being uncorrected is beyond my imagination!!!

One time when I got new glasses, a friend of mine asked me how come I started wearing bifocals, only the thing is I had already been wearing them for a couple of years by then and he never even noticed it!  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I cant compare between the lined and unlined cause Ive never had the unlined ones although Im thinking of trying them one of these days. There doesnt seem to be much agreement on which is better, some people say they have trouble getting used to progressives but others love them. If cost is an issue, the lined ones are cheaper.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>One other thing, your rx seems to be mostly for astigmatism so you are probably going to find glasses will really reduce the eyestrain for both distance and close, even without the add. Since this is going to be your first pair of glasses, maybe you should get a pair without spending loads of cash just to see how much of a difference they make and then decide whats going to work the best for you.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>But leelee is right about one thing, if you need them, you need them and your eyes and your non-aching head will thank you. Let us know what you decide and how you make out </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2005, 17:09</p><p>Ricky-- </p><p> </p><p>I have progressives---my prescription is not as high as yours, but I had increasing trouble reading smaller print and small print in dim light with my glasses on----hence the need for progressives.  Are you considering bifocals or progressives?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stuart </b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2005, 16:52</p><p> </p><p>Patrick B  </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for your response. It is pleasant to know that others experience similar situations and frustrations. Sometimes I simply think that I am vain or exaggerate!!!!!. </p><p> </p><p>To me Patrick, I think the myo discs are obvious but to others unless they are  high myopes themselves or very knowledgeable they would hardly notice or if they did be unaware of what they were observing. Front on I don't think is as obvious the side view on the right angle, I also find the way that light falls on the lenses influences how obvious they are. If I take them off and put them on a flat surface the  lense within a lense is obvious. The secretary at work actually picked them  yesterday from my desk when I was wearing my old glasses and noticed for the first time their strength and the unusualness of the lense. From my friends other than the comment of the new frames virtually no comment. Overall I am quite happy like their appeartnace and in particular their light weight - in my situation it is about as good as it will get. </p><p> </p><p>I do laugh at your comments - the cocktail hour becomes more appealing  all the time. I am sure that we would have no shortage of conversation topics and a good laugh!! </p><p> </p><p>Interestingly like you I have decided to buy another pair of myodiscs in the same frames with a reading prescription. I made an appointment this morning and once I have the prescription will look at ordering them in Hong Kong. Hang the expense, vanity rules and as you have said they are "facial architecture" a worthwhile investment.  </p><p>    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2005, 16:39</p><p>Thanks Julian. </p><p>Geoff seems to have the same as me but is younger. He wear standard old fashion bifocals and they are fine for him. So may be I am needing them to.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2005, 16:23</p><p>Ricky: The original Geoff is the person you want to talk to. He's been posting from time to time on EyeScene since before he got his first glasses at 15 or so. He's now 22, I think, and pretty myopic (though not quite -10 unless you count the astigmatism) and he has been wearing bifocals since he was 18. He posted the other week on 'Hyperopia and presbyopia progression' - you might have to click on 'View all posts' to find what he wrote.  But he likes his bifocals and is dependent on them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2005, 15:44</p><p>Sometimes I take the glasses off when I work. Usually I take them off when I'm tired and the print small. </p><p>Do you need bifocal? Heve you tried them? </p><p>I like to know what they are like if you need strong rx for short sight. No strong like some here -20 and more but over -10 like me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2005, 15:40</p><p>Well, you've got a point about the level of myopia seeming to be intolerable, Patrick. Maybe those first contacts weren't quite -8. I'm  not sure what they were. But I remember getting those contacts and then not getting them replaced for a LONG time. And I don't remember the new lenses I got (when I was about 19) being a big difference in vision acuity, although they were more comfortable because at that point I went to the RGPs.   </p><p> </p><p>As far as dealing with the myopia, I always tried to sit on the front row at school, and I guess I was able to make out the board, but it got to where I couldn't even see the board on the front row!  I guess I also lucked out and the teacher would use handouts or whatever instead of writing on the board. I don't remember holding the page that close, at least I don't remember anyone else noticing it.  One thing I did do a lot, was that I would squint, and in addition, I would pull my eyes back to narrow them so that I could get even better vision than with squinting. Even now I'm surprised at how sharp that can make my vision for something like reading a sign without correction. </p><p> </p><p>Also, as you said, there were other kids with glasses, and I do remember one guy in my class who wore glasses fairly early like me.  By highschool, he was in contacts, but once when we were about 17, I saw him in glasses and I was surprised at how thick his were (he was probably around -6 or -7 at the time).  I realized that's how my glasses would probably look if I had any (but all I had were my contacts.) This was back in the mid 1980s when glasses were quite thick. So, through the years Patrick, did you wear contacts most of the time. How often did you go out in your glasses, especially as the RX increased to myodisc level? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2005, 15:33</p><p>Ricky are you taking your glasses off to do close-up work?  If so, it might be good to check in to bifocals.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2005, 15:25</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>Wow! I can see why you were motivated to get contact lenses -- you were walking around legally blind! -8 is pretty damned myopic; I'm shocked that you were going around without correction. When I was at -8 and got my first hard contact lenses, I really had no choice but to use correction, although I didn't go fulltime with the -3s until my vision slipped past -4 or so and the blur factor was no longer tolerable.  Still, I never wore glasses to read until I was about -6 and oftentimes would hang with my friends with my glasses off just to prove that I didn't need them.  Funny enough, I just did that today.  A neighbor of mine was getting into the elevator with me (he wears -2s), and I could tell that he was noticing my glasses and their obvious strength. I rather nonchalantly took them off to clean the lenses and didn't put them back on until the two of us had reached the street.  While I could see a human form in the elevator I wouldn't have known if it were man or woman, and I deliberately let him in first so that he could hit the lobby level button which I could never have seen without stooping way over and pushing my face up against the control panel. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, didn't your parents or teachers notice how close you had to look at a book to see? (Of course the board was out of the question). With a -8 I would imagine it would have been next to impossible to even copy off of somebody else's work. I guess your tolerance of the blur factor must've made you a recordholder of some sort!  Using -3 glasses would help to a limited point up to, perhaps, -5/6, but after that you would have had vision worse than 20/400 uncorrected and the -3s would have been useless. Too, I would imagine that as you grew and your head got larger those -3s would no longer have fit your face. Funny how somebody who is such an optical obsessive put off the chance to get his very own thick specs.  I noticed that Fritz, in a recent posting, doesn't wear glasses for a mild myopic requirement.  He, too, is an oo, and you'd think that the two of you would wear your own glasses most of the time, although I do know that you see better with your contacts. </p><p> </p><p>Interesting story, Tinyeyes.  Any other anecdotes from that period when you were going about without correction?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2005, 14:54</p><p>Patrick, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for filling me in on your history.  I guess -3 was a steep RX for a 7 year old.  I was also a kid who coulnd't read the board. I started having trouble in 2nd grade.  In 3rd grade I got the glasses, and hated wearing them. I don't know what the RX was, but it was probably around -3. I guess I was around 8 years old at the time.  I hated the glasses, but I did wear them to see the board at school at first. After a year or two my eyes got worse and the glasses didn't even help that much anymore.  I didn't say anything about it though, and my parents sort of forgot about it, I guess.  But when I was 13 I decided to ask for contacts, and I got them.  I think by then I was already up to close to -8.  Since that age, I have been relatively steady (maybe it was those old non-RGP hard contacts that helped stop the progression.) I have always been between -8 and -9.  Thinking back, it's amazing that I was able to get contacts at age 13. That's pretty young, especially for 1981.  Getting the contacts really changed my life. Amazingly (thinking back again) I actually got along at school and home pretty well without correction, considering how nearsighted I was.  But the contacts made life a lot easier for me.  They took getting used to at the beginning but I was VERY motivated.  I was wearing them full-time after just a few days.  Strangely, even at the time I got the contacts, I didn't get glasses to go with them. It was until I was 22 years old that I had a pair of glasse again. That was the first time I ever had glasses stronger than those -3s, and it was a shock at first, since they were so powerful.  It was great (and sort of arousing) to be able to see clearly without contacts on (in my new coke bottle glasses.)   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2005, 12:46</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Stuart, </p><p> </p><p>I share your problem with near work.  For extended reading I wear my old -22/-23s which, like yours, are very thick.  The lense edges are heavily rolled and polished and the front is seriously concave.  They're not very attractive; I can barely see my eyes when I wear them and have to tilt them (or squint) if I need to see something in the distance.  I think I am going to get my "reading" prescription filled with blended myodiscs since they are so much lighter and thinner and look so much less powerful.  How do you like the look of yourself in them?  Do you much notice the bowl from head on?  Personally I think it looks so much better to have an identical pair of readers which you can switch to with a minimum of fuss.  Lots of people do it or, at a minimum, take off their glasses to see up close.  I just don't want to wear my old thick ones next to my relatively sleek pair of myodiscs. </p><p> </p><p>I can really relate to your myopic tales and know what it's like not to be able to see a restaurant bill. In the car recently one of my presbyobic friends handed me a map to read (he hasn't got GPS), and I couldn't see it without pulling my glasses down from my eyes.  And since that was uncomfortable I took them off and held the map right up to my face with one eye closed.  He was shocked at how shortsighted I am and even more amazed when I told him that if I moved the map so much as 1/2 to 1" farther away from my face the entire thing disappeared into a blur.  A real all or nothing. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, if my myopic gaggle pulls together once again I will let you know.  It'd be fun to be joined by you. Certainly, we could all talk about antiques when the myopia subject ran a bit low!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2005, 10:18</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>In answer to your question I started wearing glasses when I was seven and a -3.  I posted somewhere that I had probably been around a -1.5 and hadn't noticed any problems until I rather quickly went to -3 and was "caught out" in school. (By this point I was aware that I was having a problem with the board and the television but, of course, said nothing).  I progressed to -8 by the time I was nearly fourteen and then got contacts which I wore religiously.  There was a boy in my class whose vision pretty much tracked my own but who wouldn'/couldn't wear contacts.  Needless to say, I could see the steady increase in the thickness of his lenses (which I didn't like) and so I never had an up-to-date prescription myself.  When I did wear glasses I only used a very old pair for study or other close work since they were pretty much useless for distance.  I remember my myopic classmate hitting -13 (I think) and getting his first biconcave lenses.  I progressed to -18 (first myodiscs - not blended then, of course -which I rarely wore and replaced glasses that were very thick biconcave -14s/15s) when I was around twenty and then moving up very gradually over the next ten years to -23 and -25 at which point my vision stabilized.  Over the last two years I have had a slight increase again to -23.75 and -26.  Don't know if this is the start of another myopic progression, but I doubt that any increases will be anything more than minor ones.  Nevertheless, even minor increases can add up, and I hope that I don't end up pushing -30 in five years! </p><p>Has your vision remained the same or are you still experiencing some increases?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2005, 08:58</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Had a great sighting last week.  A client took me to a glamorous winemaker's dinner which was a collaboration between the restaurant and Shramsberg champagne.  Hard as it was to believe, almost all of the men were in jackets and ties and looked terrific.  Pity, really, that San Francisco is now such a sartorially sloppy city -- a fashion-free zone.  I digress.  The Shramsberg spokesman can only be described as a prep dreamboat with wavy, thick hair (starting to go grey), a wonderful clean-cut face and beautiful semi-rimless glasses of about a -6.  I am a bit myopic myself and never wear my glasses (go figure!) and found myself struggling a bit to see him from where I was sitting.  Anyway, when he made his way to our table to see how we were enjoying the various cuvees I nearly swooned.  Clearly his glasses were high-index and nearly but not quite plano.  He also was blessed with a lovely manner and a boyishness that serves him well at 40 and will continue to serve him well throughout life.  Sigh.  Why must so many of these myopic lookers be straight?! </p><p> </p><p>Another series of sightings were had at the numismatic (rare coin) convention which I attended with a friend.  No major cuties but quite a few guys with serious prescriptions.  One fellow who wasn't bad-looking was wearing glasses which were at least -12/-13.  They were loaded with compressed power rings and the plano fronts flashed beautifully.  He wasn't especially tall but filled out his jeans rather nicely.  Like Tinyeyes I probably wouldn't have noticed him if it hadn't been for his serious prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stuart </b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2005, 21:28</p><p>Patrick B </p><p> </p><p>It is pretty much as you said, I had store bought readers for my contacts and that was fine.  </p><p> </p><p>Now it is a little more problematic than anticipated. I always manage one way or another but my vanity suffers.  </p><p>I often find that I push my glasses to my forehead and hold the item to my nose and move along the page. It is tiring but it does the trick.Over the weekend I was in an antique market and could only read the price tags in this manner. When I was at the front desk and had to sign the credit card slip I had already moved my nose and glasses  myopically close only to discover that I still couldn't read it. I simply signed  as I did not want to remove glasses and bring the slip to my nose in front of the sales attendant. Vain of me!!!! Are your reading glasses prescription or simply an older pair? I wear my old glasses at work and that is Ok for reading and the computer, but they don't fit well and are quite thick!! When I visit clients and need to present it is also challenging as I don't want to wear my old glasses and can't read properly with the new ones. !! Moving the glasses down my nose doesn't work very well for me for some reason!!I am also a little reluctant as they fit very well now and I don't want to to loosen the fit. </p><p> </p><p>Your myopic coktail hour sounds like fun!!

<p><b>JR</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2005, 10:03</p><p>Ricky, when I first needed an "add" for close-up work I got bifocals---but the line and abrupt change in vision bothered me.  After a few months, I switched to progressives and was much happier.  Other people have different experiences.  Also, the bifocal line made me look old--at least I thought so.  Are you considering getting bifocals?  How often are you taking your glasses off to read?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2005, 07:36</p><p>Geoff </p><p>Ive posted the rx before. Its for short sight OD -11.50 OS -10.00.  </p><p>You have progressive lens. Is that more easy than bifocal? With strong lens the viewing area is small so the reading part may need to be more large.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoff</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2005, 07:24</p><p>Ricky, I have worn progressives for almost 10 years.  For me, they were very easy to adjust to and saved me from having to take glasses on and off with regularity.  What is your Rx?  Your eye doctor is the one who can advise you best on your need for bifocals.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2005, 07:08</p><p>Someone who reads these posts told me about varifocals and I hope if he reads this he'll say something to you.  What happens is that the +add makes the small print larger so that it's easier to read and you don't have to have 2 pairs of spex!! Neat eh?  But I haven't yet tried that, but I'm going to because when you get to my RX I have to have my nose right on the page (and one eye shut) to see - it's not funny and I never do it if anyone else is around.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2005, 06:20</p><p>JR </p><p>Everyone say you should try bifocals. But no one seem to have tried them to say how they feel. If there easy to wear and get use to.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2005, 04:38</p><p>Thomas </p><p>Do you any one who has short sight and bifocals? The more strong the glasses the less the field of vision. Bifocals make that even less I think. </p><p>Like you said. I take my glasses off to read small prints cause its so small. Its more easy to have the page near your eyes cause the print more big. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2005, 04:31</p><p>Ricky </p><p>I'm only 17 and have been advised to get varifocals so that I can have an add to be able to read small print.  The thing about these lenses is that it gives good vision near and distance and the lines between are invisible.  Like you, I thought I was too young for these but it's true that they give them to kids to avoid their myopia getting worse.  Unfortunately it's too late for me now as I've been into double figures for years now.  I believe the lenses are very expensive so it might be good to get plenty of advice before.  I've not got mine yet and am having to make sure that they will do what I need. </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes.  No offence taken!  My last posting had lol at the end which I hoped might reassure you that I was at least amused.  If my eyes were any better I might be able to appreciate other's glasses more like you!  As it is, if I do want to look at people of things, I have to be very close, and most people are very uncomfortable with that!  But one 'close encounter' that I did have recently was nice.  My brother and I were driving in a different town and had to stop and ask directions.  We were outside the swimming pools and Tim told me to ask a young guy who was standing there for directions.  Well he came to the window and knelt down (he was over 6 feet dressed in blue shorts and a white top and had longish black hair and large round, very powerful rimless spex) and when I asked him the question he said "Have you a map" so I passed him the street map.  He had to take off his glasses to read it because of the tiny print and held the book close up.  I could see him squinting a lot before he managed to point to the street and give us directions.  He noticed my thick lenses and laughed and said "Snap!" before putting on his glasses again.  So I could say that was a pleasure for me to speak to another high myope without being too self-conscious about it.  If I had thought about it more I'd have asked to try on his glasses too- I bet they were a similar Rx to mine! </p><p>I enjoy exchanging views and info here with you and the others.  It's made a real difference to my life and now I don't feel like I'm the only one with very poor eyes any more.  Still, I'm not sure I ought to be glad that there are others just as 'blind' as me - but at least we do know how it feels.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2005, 02:23</p><p>Yes its the small type I find difficult cause the correction make it more small. </p><p>But I not know anyone at my age with bifocal.  </p><p>I read some time ago that kids had rx bifocal cause it stopped the progression of shortsight but I not sure for adult.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2005, 01:05</p><p>From what I know, sometimes younger people need the bifocals, even if myopic.  Years ago I went out with a guy who was around 24 (which was about my age at the time) and he was probably around -10, and I remember him telling me he either had bifocals or was about to get them.  I'm 37 now (almost 38) so I know it's in my future.  But so far so good. I have noticed (with contacts) that it's getting harder to read very small text in dim light, or very small maps in a moving car.  But I *think* I'm still OK for now.  I'm talking about really small stuff, like 3 point type.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2005, 21:13</p><p>Geoff </p><p>Have you try bifocal? Are they difficult to get use to?. It seems there for old people. Im only 30.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoff</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2005, 19:55</p><p>Ricky, not being able to see the small print could probably be solved by an "add" to your prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2005, 16:50</p><p>Back in the sightings vein, I had a good one today at the gym. Tall, lanky white guy in his late 20s probably, with very short buzzed brown hair.  He had very small frame black rimmed glasses with thick polished edges. Definitely a high myope: I think he was in the -12 range, maybe higher.  His eyes looked really tiny, but they still filled up the frames pretty well because the frame size was so small.  Even with the small frames, his lenses were pretty thick.  Of course the fronts were plano (flat.)  For the record, I found this guy very sexy, and in large part because of his strong glasses.  I thought he looked amazing in them, and if he hadn't been wearing them, I probably would hardly have noticed him (although he wasn't bad looking at all.)  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2005, 16:43</p><p>Thomas,  I hope we haven't offended you, but a lot of us here DO find guys with thick glasses very sexy. The reason why is complicated and probably varies from person to person.  Thanks for the info about your RX progression.  It's different for everyone, I guess. I sincerely hope that your progression slows down -- you've got more than your share of myopia!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2005, 15:59</p><p>Im too young for bifocal. I take my glasses off when the print is very small cause my glasses make everything much more small cause of quite high rx.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2005, 15:24</p><p>Sorry, Imeant to add that my myopia didn't start getting really bad until I was about 11 or 12 and started growing taller.  For a while I was about -6.25 both eyes then ... zoomed up in leaps so that I needed new lenses about twice a year (but one year I needed three changes as I fell off my bike and smashed up my spex!).  Around 14 I was -13.25 then at 15 I was -14.50 and then three jumps later I'm -R: 17.25 and L: -19.25.  When I started wearing spex high index was never mentioned.  When they began to get heavy and my nose felt sore and they slid down my nose which irritated me beyond belief.  Then someone mentioned high index, but the optician said that as I was young he recommended safety lenses which were made of plastic I think, but were still quite thick.  I've now got high index and they weigh much less and stay in place, thank goodness!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2005, 15:07</p><p>Patrick B.  I'm dertermined to avoid myodiscs if possible - but thanks for all the info anyhow.

Can't understand why some people on this site think being myopic and having thick spex is sexy - it sure doesn't feel like it from my point of view lol.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2005, 10:53</p><p>Patrick, (and any other who care to say) how old were you when you first got glasses?  And how old when you first got contacts?  How quickly did your myopia progress to the present level?  Also, back in the 1980s the high index lenses weren't really available, were they? How thick were your lenses in those days?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2005, 09:42</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HMG, </p><p> </p><p>You're spot on re the centers.  Mine have been set to maximize my distance vision but, as you say, many aren't.  Thus the tilting of the head when a high myope looks into the distance.  I don't tilt so much as push my glasses up to my face for the best vision.  Am doing it less now that I've got a new prescription, but was doing it last night when I was working out on the treadmill and wanted to see the tv a bit clearer.  And Tinyeyes, I'm glad that you will now be on the lookout for that telltale myopic body language.  As if you don't have enough to do just cheking out all of those cute guys in specs! </p><p> </p><p>Thomas, </p><p> </p><p>Myodiscs are single vision, although I have been told that they can be made with a bifocal segment if the bowl is big enough.  I know what you mean about wanting to have all visual ranges set within one pair of glasses; it's certainly much more convenient than changing back and forth or trying to read without and using a magnifying glass or pressing one's face up to a book.  I can read without glasses for only a short while since my head moves like a scanner across the page which I find very irritating. Talk about myopic body language!  Someday you might want to check out a high myopia clinic where they will really know what your options are.  (I would think that Moorfield's in London would probably have high myopia specialists who could really set you straight not only on the probable  course of your myopic progression but would also know the lenses that would enable you to see your best and that would also be the best cosmetically.  Now they could tell you what kind of lenses would best go in those Oakleys! It's also just baby steps away from Jamie Oliver's trendy restaurant, Fifteen).  You're somewhat more myopic at 17 than I was at your age and probably have a few more years of increases in front of you, so myodisc lenses are probably in your future. Most people get them when their vision hits -20 or thereabouts, and you're not too far away from that in your one eye at -19.25.  Keep us posted and let us know what kind of glasses you wind up with.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoff</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2005, 08:32</p><p>Rick, you might want to talk with your doctor about having to take your glasses off to read---that is a sign that you might need for bifocals.</p><p></p><hr>

The bridge clip style might not work on your glasses because of the thickness but you might be able to bend the clips and make them work. </p><p> </p><p>I wear trifocals and the middle segment works for computers.  The problem is that if I use the computer for a long time, my neck hurts. I sit about 1 meter from the screen on this computer, use a +1 clip on over the distance part of my glasses.  My neck doesn't hurt and the screen is in focus. </p><p> </p><p>These clip-ons are hinged so I can flip them up for distance and flip them back down for the screen.  It is easier and much less expensive than Rx glasses.    </p><p> </p><p>If you can't make clip on's work, you might just be able to find some OTC readers that will fit over your glasses.

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2005, 01:43</p><p>Patrick B.  Thanks for that.  Would myodiscs help me to read?  You see what I'd really like is to have just one pair of spex which would help me see in the distance and read.  At the moment I'm having lots of trouble with reading especially paperbacks which tend to have smaller print (I don't know why) and so I do what Ricky does and leave off my glasses but it's a real hassle trying to keep the book and the magnifying glass at just the right position.  I usually end up lying flat on the floor and my nose on the page.  I'll be so relieved to get the right spex - which should be soon enough now. </p><p>Thanks too to those others who've mentioned me recently.  I'm going to get my brother to print out things so that I can get round to answering properly.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2005, 01:35</p><p>Tinyeyes.  I'm a bit amused at the idea of noticing one's own 'myopic body language' (whatever that is). Surely you can't be serious!  If I have that sort of body language it's just my way of coping with my poor eyesight - I just "do it" rather than think "What am I doing" - instinct takes over and, unless you are a complete obsessive (and I guess some here might be) you don't go round making notes about it!  But I suppose someone will want to shoot me down for saying that.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2005, 01:26</p><p>Thanks for the information everybody.  I will try to start noticing (in others and myself) the myopic body language.  Hmm.... this could be very interesting!  So, even with soft lenses, the wearer must blink to keep the lenses in the proper place?  I thought that was only an RGP thing.  I knew that RGPs didn't have astig correction, but I had forgotten about that.  It's funny and ironic that they have no astig correction yet seem to be better at correcting astigmatism!   </p><p> </p><p>I agree with the other poster -- all the super high myopic posters here are GREAT!  I don't know what you all look like, but you have sexy eyes!  Anybody willing to send their pic, send it to highmyope@hotmail.com. I promise not to post it anywhere.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2005, 22:22</p><p>If I'm the Ricky you asking I don't wear bifocals. I don't need them. If there any problem I take my glasses off and read real close to the pages. Then I see OK.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>HMG</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2005, 21:48</p><p>Tinyeyes, your astigmatism is caused by uneven corneas. When you're in your RGPs, which BTW have no astig. correction, your tear layer fills in this unevenness and corrects the astig.  Spectacle blur I'm told, should last no longer than 30 min.  With my old RGPs it would last 36hrs.  With my new ones there is only a bit of blur in one eye for 30 min.  Torics may work for you as they have an astig. correction but there is the problem of blurred vision if they go off axis. </p><p> </p><p>Patrick, if the horizontal centres of your lenses are dead on for distance you won't need to tilt back for distance.  I was told that all RXs -8 and above should be centered this way.  "Tilters" have their centres set lower down to accomodate both reading and distance which sacrifices distance if you have a high Rx.  Most opticians treat us like ordinary myopes and set our centres this way too.  Prior to having my centres done higher I thought I saw better with CLs than spex, now there's no difference and everything is laser sharp, so you won't catch me tilting (lol).  There is only one slight drawback, which is that you must tilt your head down marginally or hold your reading material slightly higher but it's dead on for the puter. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2005, 18:41</p><p>Ricky, at what age did you start wearing bifocals?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2005, 17:55</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>Thomas has it right about myodiscs as have you.  It's like looking through a small glasses lense or a large contact lens.  With my negative carriers, I can see somewhat better when my eyes stray from the bowl, although I'm probably only seeing at the -10 level which isn't very good.  The problem I have had with the convex carriers is that when your eyes stray from the bowl you really see nothing.  No transition at all and more peripheral distortion.  I like my vision with myodiscs since it is so much less distorted when I look into the distance since the skyline doesn't bend as much as it does with a conventional lens.  Thomas, you might want to give this lens type a go at some point, especially if your vision goes much beyond -20, although I know that you can get non-myodisc lenses up to at least -25 with the 1.9 lens material.  With a small frame and a blended myodisc, they really don't show all that much.  Better I think than really thick glasses. </p><p> </p><p>As to myopic body language, I can usually spot a RGP wearer because they will often tilt their heads back and look down through their contact lenses.  I can always spot contacts at the gym (regardless of type)when some of the boys sitting in the front of the room on their exercise bicycles decide to look up at the television monitors and have trouble keeping their lenses in place because of the unusual angle of their heads.  The lenses want to slip down slightly with their heads and eyes turned, and I can spot all of the continuous blinking to keep them in place.  Of course I do it as well. </p><p> </p><p>High myopic body language is readily apparent with the glasses wearer.  All high myopes have to turn their heads fully to see through the dead center portion of their lenses where the greatest correction is located.  I know that I turn my head much more than the non or low myope to see.  The high myope is also far more likely to tilt his head back slightly when looking into the distance to improve his visual acuity.  Rather like tilting one's glasses.  Also the high myope always has problems on stairs and will often reach for the rail and take the descent a bit more cautiously than someone with normal vision.  On an unfamiliar stair I always take the rail and look straight down at the first stair before making my descent. </p><p> </p><p>Check out your own myopic body language, Tinyeyes.  I'll bet you have some that would be readily apparent to an observer like me! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2005, 15:20</p><p>JD, </p><p>The torics sound like a good possible solution. They have never been recommended to me, but I will ask about them. What is your general RX level? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2005, 14:40</p><p>Tinyeyes, I'm no expert as you know, but I think the advantage of myodiscs is that because the full correction is right in the middle of the lens the edge of the whole lens is not as thick as it would be if it were a normal lens.  At least that's how it was explained to me when I met the only person I've ever seen wearing myodiscs.  He was a boy of my own age and we were at Victoria Coach Station both trying to read the timetable and not seeing very well.  He asked me for help and it was then I noticed his specs.  He showed them to me and was very matter of fact about it.  His glasses were much lighter than mine and when he tried mine he thought they were far too heavy on his nose, but his eyesight was worse than mine.  It never made me want to try myodiscs although I can appreciate why some do.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JD</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2005, 14:32</p><p>Tiny eyes: </p><p> </p><p>I wear toric lenses.  It took several months of getting used to them.  They are thicker and larger than the typical soft lens.  Toric lenses were the solution to my astigmatism.  My lenses move around and I have to close my eyes to get them in place to have clear vision again.  But, I'd rather wear contacts than my thick glasses.  So, I make due.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2005, 14:10</p><p>I have a question about the myodiscs you guys wear.  I know it's probably been explained before, but I'm asking again.  The "bowl" is the part that provides the full correction, right?  What about the other part of the lens, whether or not it's blended?  Can you see through that section of lens?  If you can't really see through that section, is it the same thing as just wearing a very very small pair of eyeglasses with the full correction on the whole lens?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2005, 11:21</p><p>Patrick B </p><p>Thanks for the info and advice.  Yes, I do have astigmatism, but so do a lot of people and they seem to be able to wear soft lenses with no problem.  Maybe next time I will talk to the eye doctor more about the soft lens option.  But I'm sure they will say that my vision would be compromised. But who knows, maybe there is something new out there. What about "toric" lenses?  I used to hear about those.   </p><p> </p><p>My glasses do have plano fronts, but they are not very strong looking in my opinion.  Out of curiosity I measured them. Looks like the lenses are about 45mm wide by 26mm deep. Similar to yours.  The thickness on the edge seems to be about 4.5 mm. They are high index of course. I have plastic frames so the edge thickness barely shows.   </p><p> </p><p>Question: what is high myopic body language?  Does it happen with contacts on or only with glasses?   I would love to be able to spot a high myope in contacts.  Sometimes I get hunches, but I'm not very good at it. </p><p> </p><p>Your comment about stairs is funny. Even at -8, I know what you're talking about.  When I was a teenager I wore nothing but contacts for several years. When I got some glasses again in my early 20s, it was very weird getting used to them. Walking anywhere, especially on stairs, was strange, and weird as it sounds, I had a hard time distinguishing coins at first -- through the high powered glasses, my brain thought that quarters were nickels and nickels were dimes. Weird phenomonen.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2005, 10:11</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Stuart, </p><p> </p><p>Forgot to answer your question re reading. I'm 46 and have the normal accomodative problems associated with somebody in that age group. (When I was young my accomodative powers were quite good, unlike young Thomas). Since bifocals are out of the question with a 20mm bowl, I usually pull my glasses down a bit from my face to read easily.  Of course I do end up holding reading material closer to my face than is normal and dislike that high myopic look. I also have a pair of reading glasses with a prescription which is two diopters less than my distance glasses.  I use these when I'm reading for any length of time.  I presume that you wore reading glasses when you wore contacts.  What are you doing today?  When I wear contacts I simply use a cheap pair of dime store "cheaters". </p><p> </p><p>By the way, I always have the same reaction when a low minus starts bitching about their "horrible" eyesight: "You've got to be kidding!" A -3 can function almost 100% without correction and could, if necessary, drive a car.  A guy I know who was a -1 and didn't have a driving restriction on his year-old license went for an eyetest and found out that he was now a -2.5 and had only recently "noticed" he was having a problem with road signs at night.  I had never noticed that he was having any difficulty driving without correction, and certainly I'm tuned into things like that.  He promptly went out and got his first pair of glasses and now wears them fulltime.  He looks terrific in them, too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2005, 08:47</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>Since all of the high myopic posters are guys, I think the thread is perfect! In answer to your question, I have both RGP and soft CLs.  The RGPs provide a crisper vision to the soft, but the soft are more comfortable.  I seem to recall that you also have some amount of astigmatism, and that is perhaps why your doctor prescribes the rigid lenses for you.  I presume that the blur goes away with time and can only think that the RGP lenses temporarily changes the shape of your cornea causing the additional refractive error. You might want to ask your doctor about this phenomenon and check out a pair of soft contact lenses.  They're so cheap these days that you could consider them a throw-away if you didn't like them.  What kind of glasses do you have?  At -8 I would imagine the lenses to be plano-fronted.  The advantage to your prescription, of course, is that you can use a wide variety of frames with your prescription, something I can only do if I go for a convex lens and am willing to have my bowls surrounded by a sea of plus carrier.   </p><p> </p><p>Stuart, </p><p> </p><p>My frames are 46 wide by 26 deep with 20mm bowls.  The edge thickness is around 8mm for the left and stronger lens and around 7mm for the right.  As a typical American I haven't got a decent metric ruler and still think in terms of inches and feet!  Are you getting used to wearing glasses once again and are you getting used to stairs?  Funny you don't know many myopic people. My myopic cocktail gang would have really been quite a sight for you.  All of us (even the -9) had that tell-tale myopic body language. Better yet, it would have been fun for you to have joined this visually-challenged group to add your own "war" stories!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2005, 00:36</p><p>Patrick B, </p><p> </p><p>I'm glad you are able to wear contact lenses as well as glasses when you want.  Do you wear hard (RGP) lenses or soft?  I wear the RGP lenses and have for a long time.  I do have some problems with them and I need to be careful too.  I have some problems with spectacle blur -- that is, sometimes when I put my glasses on after a lot of lens wear, I can't see very well with the glasses, particularly in the left eye.  Any advice about this would be appreciated (from anyone, not just Patrick).  I think it only happens with rigid contact lenses but I'm not sure.  I also worry about this problem because I don't want to affect a refraction the next time I get tested for new glasses and/or contacts. </p><p> </p><p>And if anyone knows, please explain, why is it that I have to wear the RGP lenses?  The eye doctors have always said that I would have terrible vision with soft lenses.  I wonder why. I mean, I know -8 is bad, but as we see her, prescriptions go way higher than that, and apparently many higher myopes are able to wear soft lenses.   </p><p> </p><p>BTW, I NEVER sleep in my lenses.   </p><p> </p><p>Thanks.  I hesitate posting about this on the Guys forum, but I hope you all won't mind.</p><p></p><hr>

Over the weekend when I have my old glasses at  hand I will measure them exactly.

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2005, 16:54</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>I agree with Stuart that a -8 prescription is pretty significant.  That prescription probably puts you in the top 10% of myopes, and, as you know from all of your sightings, anything in that range or higher is relatively uncommon. However, my -12 friend and I had drinks the other night and were joined by a friend of his who is -18!  While we were sitting there we were joined by somebody who was a -9.  Talk about myopia city!!  I'm clearly the most myopic, but because we were all wearing approximately the same type of frame and everyone had the highest index lenses appropriate for his prescription, I would say our lenses all looked about the same in strength to a non-oo type. My myodiscs really don't show when I'm wearing them and only "pop out" when I take them off. The fellow with the -18s was rather good-looking and his lenses were biconcave and slightly rolled and polished at the edges.  (Mine aren't polished). He spotted the myos fairly quickly and wanted to know all about them since his vision continues to worsen -- albeit at a slow rate-- and his doctor has told him that he should consider myodisc lenses since he's approaching that -20 transition line. </p><p> </p><p>Glad to see that Thomas is working through his options.  By the time he's in his mid-40s all levels of myopia will probably be correctable through some form of surgery.  Perhaps a more sophisticated form of Lasik will have been developed that will enable those with vision over -8/-10 to be fully corrected.  </p><p> </p><p>Unlike Stuart, I still wear contact lenses a great deal (my vision is better with them) but have found that I wear them a bit less now so I don't begin to develop those problems of which Stuart spoke.  I really think one needs to give one's corneas a rest and some people never do.  I've one myopic friend who is a -7 who always has one lens in 24-7 so that he can pretend that he has normal vision when he moves around in the morning. (He alternates the overnight lens each night). The only time he ever has both lenses out is when he's at the doctor's for an eye exam. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, I, too, am glad that this thread has developed so much traffic.  </p><p></p><hr>

I am -8 and much prefer wearing my contacts (for vision) to my glasses, even though I love glasses.  I guess -8 seems very weak to you!   </p><p> </p><p>Thomas, is your brother someone who also posts on here?  Sometimes I get confused.  What is his RX?

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2005, 08:20</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Thomas, </p><p> </p><p>You've had a pretty big increase since your last prescription so your new glasses should really crisp up your vision.  I had a nearly identical increase to yours and do notice the difference in lens strength. And, by getting a slightly smaller frame, I was able to keep my lens thickness the same. </p><p> </p><p>I agree with Stuart about all of the options available to a high myope.  You're lucky today.  When I was your age my prescription wasn't quite as high as yours but it was still around -16 and the lenses were really thick  before the advent of high index materials.  John Lennon-style frames were quite popular.  I was always being pushed into getting myodiscs which were unblended and way too noticeable.  Some people like the blended bifocals and others like your age contemporary, Brian, prefer the executive type.  (And he wears trifocals!) You also might ask your eye doctor about biconcave lenses.  Since part of the power is in the front of the lens your lenses can be made somewhat thinner.  And remember to keep your frames on the small side.  A 53mm lens width is way too wide for your prescription. </p><p> </p><p>So get the best combination of frame and lens that you possibly can and remember to think of your glasses as facial architecture.  I'll bet you look great in them. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2005, 06:31</p><p>Ricky: You're Rx is much less than mine so I don't regard yours as serious.  I have some Chinese friends in London and their three children all wore thick glasses by the time they were 8 or 9, the youngest wore hers at age 4!  We also have a Taiwanese friend who wears contacts and spex - she is -26 in the worst eye - so you are fortunate!  They attribute their myopia to genetics AND environment because of the lack of space most people have to 'acommodate' to a restricted space and so their eye muscles never quite relax properly.  Also, the Chinese alphabet is large and small (LOL) so their eyes are focussed more.  That's how it was explained to me by my friends.  The Chinese are very hard working and study for longer and so many youngsters ruin their eyes at an early age.  I'm told that 84% of medical students are very myopic with about 33% of those with severe myopia (above -6D).  It's an epidemic they say and the government is very worried. </p><p>Tinyeyes:  Yes, I'm afraid my poor eyesight is all too real and is still increasing - not much I can do about it now. I come from a myopic family too - it goes back to my grandfathers on both sides - one of whom wore pince-nez from time to time but the other NEVER got spex at all!! I've got one or two old pics of my spex but am too ashamed to show any of me.  Sorry.  My brother might tho', if you ask him. LOL.  </p><p>For Stuart and Patrick B.  I mentioned that I'm hoping to get new spex but I'd like to say that I intend to get varifocal lenses so that nobody knows I'm so blind!  At 17 I'm still a bit sensitive to people's comments about my bad eyes and so bifocals would only draw attention to that. </p><p>Thomas</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2005, 03:34</p><p>May be the cause for short sight is also environment and where you live is better for you than here. </p><p>My Rx is OD -11.50 -1.50 x90 and OS -10.00 -2.00 x110 </p><p>yes, I'm 30.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doreen</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2005, 03:29</p><p>Hi!I hope you don't mind a girl posting a sighting. I was in Berlin last weekend and at a restaurant I saw something that confused me a bit. When I came there was a waiter standing outside wearing glasses-not his style, rectangular, but the frames were to big and white to grey- he seemed to be of turkish descent, not bad looking anyway. I was pleased when he took my order and when he came back to bring the drinks, which took a long time, he wasn't wearing the glasses, but contacts, I suppose, because I didn't see him squint and I was there for about two hours. He didn't seem to have problems with the contacts though, so I wondered why he had been wearing glasses before. Any guesses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2005, 00:23</p><p>It may seem like all Asian guys need glasses, but that isn't true -- at least not here in the U.S. I have met a few (only a few so far) but a few, who have perfect eyesight.  Which wasn't a great discovery, as far as I'm concerned!   </p><p> </p><p>Ricky, you are 30 years old?  What is your present RX?  Inquiring minds want to know! </p><p> </p><p>Stuart and Thomas: Wow, are you guys for real with -20 RXs?  I wonder if anyone besides me would like to see pictures of you in your glasses?  Especially in your new glasses, but in the old ones too.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2005, 22:36</p><p>Approx 90% of Chinese guys have short sight. Many Chinese like me have very short sight. Our eye sights also continue to worse after teenage when you expect it to start to stop. My Rx doubled from 12 to 15 years and doubled again now I am 30. So I'm technical blind without glsses. If you see a Chinese guy without glasses he likely wear contacts or have laser eye treatment. Nobody know why Chinese have so much short sight. Hong Kong is the top for this. It is believe the cause is both genetic and also environment. Perhaps we work to hard. Certainly by 10 years most Hong Kong kids have glasses. By uni nearly all have them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2005, 17:54</p><p>Stuart, Hi - don't think we've spoken before.  Thanks for reply.  I'd be interested in hearing how you get on with ordering your new spex.  Could you let me know and if, possible send a picture so that I can see what the finished product looks like.  I thought my Rx was huge, but it looks as if yours is greater - but with -19.25 I guess there isn't much to choose between us. Good luck. </p><p>Thomas</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoff</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2005, 17:25</p><p>What is the reason that nearly 100% of Asian men wear glasses?  Is it true that myopia is an epidemic in Asia?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stuart</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2005, 16:43</p><p>Thomas </p><p> </p><p>I agree with Patrick B, try the Hong Kong company. If you look at the web site towards the bottom of the home page there is a"special request button", </p><p>Just ask them about the possibility of fitting your prescription into Oakleys  that you like. These companies are all about volume sales and are very sales focussed. Another alternative, which may be possible is to purchase the Oakleys in England send them to Hong Kong and have them make and fit your lenses. </p><p> </p><p>I have not ordered from them but am intending to do so, and I have an Rx of over -20.Read all the feedback which is in some ways an indicator and I do know of someone who has ordered all their glasses over the past 5 years with a prescription of over -10. They are as good as the measurements you give them </p><p>as you work your way through the order form. You can also have the final adjustments done in England at an optometrist. </p><p> </p><p>Being a high myope brings its challenges but there have been great technological advances. In some ways in 2005 we have information overload and need to do a great deal of research ourselves to ensure that we make the best possible decisions. </p><p> </p><p>Good luck and keep us informed.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2005, 15:39</p><p>Patrick B.  Yes, I've seen the site you mention.  The frames don't really appeal to me so far, but I'll keep looking for these oakleys!  Thank you for your advice and I hope to let you know how things go.  I think it was my brother who said he might go to Taiwan but the plans have changed now - maybe next year.  With my high RX will I need to go to the Hong Kong shop myself and be measured for glasses.  That would be impossible if only for financial resons!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2005, 15:14</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Thomas, </p><p> </p><p>Glad you're taking your time with your new glasses.  Yes, a bifocal segment will require a greater depth to be accomodated in any meaningful way.  However, you really should consider a frame (including the very cool Oakleys) </p><p>which are under 50mm in width.  With lenses as strong as yours, a smaller frame can make a big difference in overall lens thickness as will the highest index lenses.  At a minimum you should order a 1.7 as you presently have but should examine some of the alternatives in the higher indexes lens materials which have to be available in the UK. Perhaps you should check out the website for a Hong Kong-based company called Optical4Less.  They specialize in all of the high prescription, and their prices are quite competitive.  I'm going to try them next time I get another pair of glasses.  Their lenses are about half the price of the same lenses here in the States.  I think you mentioned that you might be going to Australia or Hong Kong in the near future.  If I were you I certainly would take my prescription along to one of the mhyopia capitals of the world and see what one of these high prescription specialists could do for you.  You (or rather your parental units!) might save enough money on your glasses to make a trip out there worthwhile in and of itself.  And I'll bet that an outfit like Optical4Less wouldn't have a problem fitting lenses into a pair of Oakleys. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, keep us posted.  You are going to love having bifocals and being able to see without strain.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2005, 11:03</p><p>Can anyone help, I pleased someone just mentioned having an add on there prescription as this is what my question is about I've always really had a thing for glasses and before needing them I used to wear reading glasses but really wanted a pair of minus distance glasses and I guessed I might be able to see out of them anyway when I was 20 I got the courage to go and get an eye test and blagged the doctor and got a pair -0.25 in both eyes I really didn't need them as my eye sight was near on perfect but she thought they would help me with head aches I said I got, anyhow as time went on I wanted to get stronger lens but my dream started coming a bit too true and five years down the line I now really do need glasses, I have to say now I don't want to need them well not this much buy hey its happened, I don't know if I should blame my self for wearing glasses when I didn't need them or computer use maybe a bit of both it may not sound much but I'm up to -1.25 in both eyes and my distance vision is not good at all now and its affecting my life, problem is I don't wear them out as the glasses thing is too much of a fetish I just can do it, Right OK I'm going to get to the point now, I've now got a thing for + glasses but can't really see at a distance through them, I did find some weak ones on line +0.25 which I wear for the computer at home, but what I really want now is distance glasses with a + add I've found a shop on line where you just put in your prescription but don't have to send the real thing, so can anyone suggest a prescription i.e.: -1.25 add + 0.50 I don't have anything else on my normal prescription its just -1.25 in both eyes and nothing else so how much of an add do you think would be ok? bearing in mind I do want to see out of them clearly for close and near, and you never know I might start wearing them to work!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2005, 16:56</p><p>HMG and Patrick B.  Thanks.  Yes, I've had an increase on the Rx of L .75 and R 1.25 but as well as that he's given me and add on each eye of +2.25 to enable me to read small print which is what I'm having most trouble with.  The question is would a pair of oakleys with the small frame you describe be deep enough to take the add because my brother says that it has to be a bit deeper than normal which is why I can't just have my present spex updated.  I'm taking my time about getting new glasses as these look like being very expensive this time and I want to make sure I do the right thing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2005, 09:15</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Thomas, </p><p> </p><p>HMG is right about the smaller-sized Oakleys as well as the higher-index lens materials.  The 1.8 and 1.9 would make a big difference for you in lens thickness.  I've got the 1.8. I just got my new glasses which have a slightly stronger prescription from my last pair (OS -26 and OD -23.75), and I am enjoying the clearer view.  They're a bit thicker but the blended myodiscs aren't all that noticeable.  I think you're going to love the add; it's going to be so much easier than having to put your nose right against the page to see or, worse, having to use a magnifying glass. </p><p> </p><p>What's your new prescription?  Did your brother get an update as well?  Keep us posted and remember that there is always more than one way to skin a cat!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2005, 04:31</p><p>again!  sorry forget to say my present spex is 53x20x140  but I don't know what index  - the lens thickness at the outside is about 8mm approx.  Can I get something a bit thinner than that do you think?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2005, 04:28</p><p>HMG Thanks for that and the email!  I'm in the UK and they are very fussy here so maybe I should think of abroad.  but as you said, maybe you need to be present for them to fit the spex on you, and that would be a big problem!  but I won't give up and have been back to the oakley site to do some checking, then I'll have to decide.  I'll keep you posted.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2005, 01:11</p><p>I was able to view the video after I downloaded the Realplayer.  Thanks for the link.  I agree --- I didn't watch the entire thing yet, but it seems like Jonathan is always too small, and always viewed from above so it's hard to get a good look at him.  But it was great to get a sense of his voice, mannerisms and personality.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>HMG</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2005, 19:33</p><p>Thomas, if you really want Oakleys they come as small as a 47 mm eye size.  Check out their site on-line.  Any frame that has 2.0 after it is that size.  Then get Zeiss 1.8 or 1.9 index glass lenses.  If you're in the states you might have to sign a waiver first.  Check out Zeiss for bi or multifocal availability.  If there is no info on the USA site click on european sites.  Everything there is available in Canada if you can't find what you want in the USA.  Your lenses could end up as thin as 5 mms.  What eye size, lens thickness and refractive index do you wear now?  There are lotsa options, don't let your optom stop you from wearing what you want.  Glasses are popular, fashionable and meant to be enjoyed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2005, 15:19</p><p>Patrick B.   Thanks for the last message and sorry I've been away for a while.  No luck about the oakleys - I've just had a new test and I'm up in both eyes.  The optician refuses to give me another pair of rimless and says that oakleys are out of the question for someone with my Rx. I'm also having a reading add +2.25 in both eyes but it will have to be semi rimless I think but with varifocal lenses.  But I'm not going to forget the oakleys - and maybe send away for them to be made abroad if that's possible.  Anyhow, thanks for your support - I'll let you know how it goes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2005, 09:23</p><p>Tinyeyes, I wouldn't really want to be gay, given the major horror stories I have heard from my gay friends. It's just that guys seem to be more open to indulging in fetishes, and being an OO I have found only one or two women in my entire life who humor me on this and seem to enjoy it! </p><p> </p><p>I guess the other thing I have always appreciated in my friendships with gay guys is the ability to form close bonds.

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2005, 21:24</p><p>NJ: It's nice to hear you say these things, but I'm a little confused.  I can understand a gay guy wishing he were straight, because it would make things easier in life.  But why would a straight guy want to be gay?  Because gay men have more sex? Is that what you're saying? Not necessarily true.  And as far as the glasses thing goes, gay men are more likely than straight men to wear contacts.  But are they more likely than straight women to wear glasses? Hmm, don't know. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2005, 18:10</p><p>I agree with tinyeyes that Fritz's sighting was a great one.  First to watch him squinting to see the signs -- while wearing his glasses -- then the fairly big jump in rx.  That guy's going to find that he's a lot more dependent on his glasses than he once was.  The low rx's like tinyeye's -2 Asian can be interesting, especially when the guy trys to avoid wearing his glasses as much as he can. </p><p> </p><p>Some interesting sightings today at our local Pridefest (we can't compete with the big city nearby for the end of June time).  Despite the tendency of gay men to wear contacts no matter how uncomfortable, there were a fair number wearing spex.  A cute looking short, slim young Asian wearing -5 or -6 wirerims.  A handsome, black man mid to late 20's wearing maybe -5.50 with hi-index lenses in big black plastic frames that actually suited him very well. A slim, lanky guy wearing somewhat large round wirerims with at least a -8 rx.  A very young straight guy walking around holding his girlfriend's hand wearing quite strong glasses -9?  It's cute the way some of the straight guys can be accepting enough to appear at Pridefest but cling to their girlfriend so no one will think they're gay. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2005, 14:42</p><p>That's a great sighting, Fritz!  It doesn't have to be a  high myope to be a good sighting.  I've had a number of mini-sightings lately, but nothing like that! We have a gay film festival going on right now, and I've gone to a few of the screenings.  There are always guys in the audience who put on their glasses just for the movie (usually low minus of course.)  It's cute seeing them put on their glasses so they can see the screen!  Last night, there was a particularly cute Asian guy (short, twentiesomething, and kind of butch acting) who I saw before the event started, waiting with his friend.  He kept playing with his glasses, trying to avoid wearing them.  They were oval wire rims, maybe -2?  For a while he wore them hooked over his ears, but backwards so they were on the back of his head.  Anything to avoid wearing them!  Of course, when the event started and he needed to see the screen, he wore them the whole time. Very cute. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2005, 11:03</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Had a great sighting on Friday.  I was coming out of my HMO's pharmacy, which is across the hall from the optical department, when I saw a 6-1", dark-haired Italian-type coming up the hall wearing really terrific jeans.  27/28 years of age and size a 32 waist.  He had on gold-framed glasses of a so-so style, and as he walked up the hallway I saw him squint at the sign hanging down from the ceiling which directed people to either the pharmacy or the optical department.  He then looked into the optical department and squinted once again before entering the door.  Well, this was too much for me.  On the pretext of checking out sunglasses, I watched him get his new eyeglasses:  semi-rimless which really suited him to a T.  I would estimate his old glasses were around -2.5 and the new ones around -4.  They were noticeably stronger.  Without saying much of anything to the optician (whose command of the English language was minimal, at best), he bounded out of there.  By the time I was able to leave (after being asked if I wanted help by one of the staff people), he was gone.  Lucky me.  When I went to my car he was  getting into his car which was just across the street from my own.  I could watch him take his glasses off for deep inspection and then put them on to see what he could see through them.  He was clearly testing out the new prescription.  He did this at least four times before taking off.  Totally hot!  I know he wasn't a super myope, Tinyeyes, but he's getting into some pretty serious territory here.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2005, 20:51</p><p>I took a look at his bio on the NASA website.  He received his Master's Degree from Purdue in 1978.  He may now be 51 years old, balding, and packing a few extra pounds, but he has very clear skin and nice features.  I bet that back in his grad school days, he was quite the hottie.  I believe that it was during the 1970's that modern technology made lightweight, but oh so thick, plastic lenses the alternantive to heavy glass ones.  Of course that  was updated years later with high index.  but, even in high index material, I bet Waynes glasses are still thick.  Any guesses on his prescription? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2005, 00:51</p><p>you don't have to pay for gaydar unless you want an unrestricted membership but the part of the site i was talking about is not restricted anyway, I really do think it would be a really good idea the get a room like that on there, if they had a room like that listed your highly more likely to meet lots of guys, it will bring out lots of new guys who like guys in glasses and also just the guys who wear glasses who aren't really turned on by it but like the idea of others who are and know they will get some attention. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2005, 23:48</p><p>Wayne -- I love your story about the Asian athletes from the 1950s who were nearsighted.  Wow!  Any chance you could scan these pictures and post them somewhere (like on the Guys with Glasses Yahoo group).  Would LOVE to see them!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2005, 07:55</p><p>I think the point is that there are likely a lot of gay guys out there who are turned on by glasses but haven't connected with others like themselves -- or even realized that we exist.   </p><p> </p><p>So far as I know, we only have the Yahoo  groups and eyescene (which is predominantly about women in glasses).

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;09 Jul 2005, 20:25</p><p>Id say at laest 90% of guys 18 and older wear glasses or contcts unless they have had laser treatment. Nearly half would be high myopes. Thats -6 or -7 and over. So wearing thick glasses is the norm here.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;09 Jul 2005, 10:50</p><p>I've been following the discussion of the high incidence of myopia in Asian countries.  When I was still a teen in the 50's in Los Angeles, California, I developed a special interest in Asian guys (about a third of the student body) -- a significant part of which was that so many of them were nearsighted.   </p><p> </p><p>Many of them were also athletes.  In those pre-contact lens days they would play football bare-eyed.  They always played defense as they couldn't see well enough for offense -- throwing or catching a pass would have been impossible.   </p><p> </p><p>I remember overhearing one guy complaining because while sitting on the bench he couldn't see anything that was happening on the field.  He was the first in my class to get contacts in our senior year, 1960 -- the original hard lenses. </p><p> </p><p>There's a wonderful picture in my yearbook of a defensive lineup with a muscular Japanese-American guy in the center.  Off the field he wore very strong, thick glasses and the myopic stare at the blur in front of him is deliciously obvious in the picture. </p><p> </p><p>I should mention that this sort of thing was the only interest I had in football, or any sport.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;09 Jul 2005, 10:26</p><p>Just had a nice sighting that I thought I'd post while it's fresh in my mind.  Just went to the 7-11 (convenience store) and found myself in line behind a very slim young man wearing dark sunglasses and with his shirt off.  He couldn't have been more than 18.   </p><p> </p><p>I usually don't pay attention to really young guys -- especially if they fall in the "twink" category -- but do make exceptions.  He was masculine in manner (probably straight) but had a slim, smooth, sensual tapered body.   </p><p> </p><p>I hadn't realized that there was a glasses interest until I looked through the sunglasses from behind and realized there was a significant minus prescription.  Hard to be sure of rx because of the dark lenses but from the minification, I think around -5.  Not high by OO standards but certainly enough to be dependent on them and to wear very dark lenses to make that less obvious. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;09 Jul 2005, 08:52</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Thomas, </p><p> </p><p>The big changes should start to slow when your major growth is over, although you can still get some increases.  I was around -18 and -19  at 20 when the increases started slowing down.  For the next ten years I averaged around -.50 when the increases stopped.  Still, enough to add -5 to my total prescription over a long period of time.  I mentioned that I have gone up over the oast three years by -.75 and -1.00, enough to warrant new glasses which I have ordered. </p><p> </p><p>Any luck with the Oakleys?  Let us know how that goes.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cooper</b>&nbsp;09 Jul 2005, 06:55</p><p>Ricky--what would you say is the percentage of males in Hong Kong who wear glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;09 Jul 2005, 04:17</p><p>Ricky, you're lucky!  Mt older brother has around your RX but I'm 17 now and have -18.00 &amp; 16.50 and it's still going up.  I wonder when my eyesight will settle?  I don't suppose that it has anything to do with my height because until I was into my teens I was only around -10 but as soon as I started really growing the numbers went right up almost keeping in line with my chronological age-strange that!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ricky</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2005, 23:15</p><p>Im in Hong Kong. Like Singapore nearly every one wears glasses. At uni I dont think any one in my class didnt wear glasses.

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2005, 13:19</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>Interesting sighting in the bank.  It's funny how I don't expect to see Latinos in thick glasses but am never surprised by Asians.  Of course, Asians, by percentage, are far more myopic than other racial groups, and those articles about the explosion of myopia in Singapore and Taiwan certainly attests to that fact.  Nevertheless, I do find it kind of hot to see a cholo-type wearing high minius glasses.  The glasses are at such a variance with the general image that he is trying to portray that I find it kind of a turn-on.  You were probably best not to stare as I'm sure he's mighty sensitive about his glasses.  When I was in junior high there was a really athletic black guy who was probably wearing -8/9s (no high-index back then), and he'd get really defensive if someone mentioned his glasses. (They were very small rectangles with plano fronts and unpolished edges.  I can't remember if edges were polished back then. Quite thick, too.) He'd oftentimes hang around with his friends with his glasses in hand just to appear that he didn't need them.  Of course, the moment he needed to see something (like his food!), he would very nonchalantly put them back on. A friend of mine's boyfriend also does that.  I spotted his contact lens packets one night alongside bathroom sink and noted -7.5 so I knew he couldn't realistically see a thing without correction.  Not too much later when we were at dinner at his lover's club in Boston he took his -8 glasses off for quite a while and made continued to make "meaningful" eye contact with those of us at the table.  I knew he couldn't really see us and when the waiter handed out the menus he waited until we were all looking at ours before replacing his glasses so that his nose wasn't too close to the text.  Sexy guy, incidentally, and much better looking with his eyewear.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2005, 12:20</p><p>Thanks Fritz.   The Asian guy (who was a friend of a friend) was indeed a good looking, trendyish guy.  His glasses were nice looking wire rims, but could probably have used an update style wise.  I wouldn't push for that, though --- they were really sexy just as they were!  I don't know the guy well, but I found him on "Friendster" via the mutual friend's account, and he was in contacts in the pictures on there.  So that's why I figure he must wear contacts either most of the time or all of the time.   </p><p> </p><p>Had another sighting today, but it was brief.  This was a Latino, cholo type guy walking into the bank as I was.  He was probably 30 the oldest, and would have been cuter if not so heavy and stocky (for my tastes anyways).  His glasses were super strong, but I had to be careful and couldn't look at him too much.  They were very small rectangles, much smaller than normal, and there was edge thickness and deep cut in.  I'm pretty sure he was at least -12 or above.  I know what you mean about the sightings -- sometimes you love the strong glasses, but wish the person were a lot better looking (not to mention gay).  Oh well, he was cool anyway!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2005, 08:03</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>You've got the right info. re plano lenses.  Loved your sighting, incidentally.  SF is very Asian, and I have noticed how many of the trendier Asians wear glasses -- even those with high prescriptions.  Saw a tall Asian man ysterday who was quite good-looking with rimless plano-fronted glasses in the -8 category.  Also saw a caucasian fellow who was around 35 who had oval biconcave lenses of around -16/17. Lots of cut-in and polished edges. Not very good-looking but would have been acceptable if his bushy hair hadn't been piled on top of his head and tied off with some sort of band.  He was drinking coffee and peering very myopically at a book -- closer than normal -- and more and more so as his glasses gradually moved down his nose.  Hot to watch; I only wish he had got a haircut.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2005, 07:16</p><p>OO means Optic Obsessive, right? </p><p> </p><p>As for the plano front, you are on the right track. The front of the lens is often flat on strong minus prescriptions (for high nearsightedness) because if the front was convex (curved out) the back side of the lens would have to be even more concave (curved in) and thus thicker.  The plano lenses are a little thinner than if they weren't plano, but they are more reflective.  The guy I described in my last posting definitely had the plano fronts.   </p><p> </p><p>I'm not an optics expert, so correct me if I'm wrong. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Watcher</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2005, 03:37</p><p>Been visiting here on and off but could anyone help?  What does 00 mean? Seen it on some postings and think I should know, but don't!  Also, plano-fronted glasses.  Is that when an otherwise very thick lens is kinda shaved off making it flat at the front and is that the cause of why so many of my friend's glasses reflect such a lot of the light back to me?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2005, 09:41</p><p>I went to an outdoor movie screening this weekend, and one of my friends was meeting another friend there.  His friend walked up and I almost fainted -- hunky, cute Asian guy, wearing jeans and a tight t-shirt, and (surprise surprise) coke bottles.  I think he usually wears contacts, but for someone reason it was a glasses night.  Rectangular wire rims, polished edges, RX somewhere in the -8 to -10 range, and apparently quite sufficient for movie viewing.  He was spectacularly tinyeyed and HOT!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2005, 14:28</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Malcolm, </p><p> </p><p>Are you new to this site?  If so, welcome.  Yes, I have had some wonderful sightings of guys who will take off their glasses for a workout and then find themselves squinting away at anything in the near distance.  One of my favorites is this cute, blond 23/24 Irish-American at my club who I'd say is now pushing a -4.  I think to prove that he can still get around well without glasses he never wears them into the shower/shaving room and not to read a newspaper.  I love watching him squint when somebody waves at him, and he can't see who it is.  His prescription has definitely gone up over the last two years, and his rimless glasses are now noticeably stronger to the OO.  There are a number of guys who are in the -1 to -2 range who also don't wear their glasses to workout, and it's always fun to watch them squint.  Basically, I love that erotic juxtaposition of handsome strong bodies against weak eyes.  There is something at variance with the picture they like to portray of themselves.  Strong body, weak eyes.  There is also another good-looking guy who has pretty bad astigmatism.  He never wears glasses when he works out or reads the paper.  It's always fun to watch him hold the newspaper so close to his face as well as to watch him struggle with the TV.  He's the type to always wear prescription sunglasses as much of the time as possible, and I have never seen him wear glasses in public.  Then there is the swimming hunk with the flawless body who has, perhaps, a -1, and wears them everywhere.  He looks fabulous in them and knows it!!  Clearly, he doesn't need them for all that much but loves the cosmetic effect.  I'm sure he's a secret OO and was delighted to be able to get a prescription.  Another of the hunky gym boys was always squinting at the TV and then, one day, wasn't.  Contacts, of course.  Then about eight months ago I noticed him squinting again and in obvious need of a prescription update which I think he has got since the squinting has ceased.  He's the type who probably doesn't even own a pair of glasses and wouldn't be caught dead in them. </p><p> </p><p>How about some of your sightings?  I'm sure you've got more than one to tell </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>malcolm</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2005, 03:37</p><p>Fritz, wonderful sightings. Do you have any memories of cute guys taking their glasses off and obviously not being able to see?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2005, 09:58</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Julian, </p><p> </p><p>Glad you enjoy my sightings; clearly, I enjoy them as well.  Yesterday when I was downtown doing a workout at my club I was treated to the sight of a 25-year old who was stripping down next to me in the locker room.  Dark short hair and extremely hairy.  He was almost simian but very good-looking and possessed a wonderful body (ah, youth!)  He also had on an oval pair of plano-fronted rimless glasses with at least a -6 prescription.  When I saw him later up on the cardiofitness floor I thought he was holding a newspaper a bit closer to his face than normal and then saw him half-squint at some sports broadcast from across the room.  Definitely time for a prescription update.  Virtually all of the guys at my club are straight and  don't wear glasses.  Lots of CLs, unfortunately, but one of my very favorites is clearly headed to correction in the near future.  He's a six-foot "dirty blond" with an incredible body, Marine Corps poster boy face, hairy chest and cornflower blue eyes.  I love to watch him screw up his eyes when he's working out on an exercise machine when he's trying to see the TV.  A total turn-on. I think his myopia is a fairly recent phenomenon since I don't remember him squinting last year.  He's probably in denial at this stage.  Another myopic doll in denial is the gorgeous son of one of SF's leading socialites.  Talk about an uber-prep.  He, too, should be wearing glasses but doesn't.  Lots of delicious squinting when looking at the TV, although I never see him do it anyplace else.  </p><p> </p><p>Yes, I have thought of writing a story.  I've several ideas but haven't had the time to sit down and begin to write.  By the way, I was in London last month for my yearly UK fix and, as always, was disappointed by the limited number of glasses wearers.  I did see one major cutie while watching the Liverpool-Milan match at the RAC who was exactly my type: a dark-haired, square-jawed prep type with -2/3 lenses in ordinary metal frames.  Another one on the way for a prescription update as he was always half-squinting at the TV monitor.  Later ran into him in Sloane Street where we both waved and said "hello" to each other without stopping.  A friendly club, the RAC. </p><p> </p><p>Take care. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2005, 22:58</p><p>Fritz, you do say the nicest thiings - and I was already going to say how much I've enjoyed your sightings. Ever tried writing stories of your own? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2005, 17:23</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>More than happy to oblige.  I would estimate my acquaintance's glasses to be around -12, although I have never asked him.  Maybe with my -12/-14 GOC we will eventually engage in a conversation re respective prescriptions.  I do feel a bit of a fraud, but ...  Anyway, today when I went to an art shop to pick up something I had framed, the framer surprised me with his glasses. (I hadn't previosly noticed that he was a contact lens wearer.) The guy is mid-twenties and very nerdy; however, he was wearing some very smart plastic rectangular glasses with a prescription somewhere around yours (-8/-9)  They really suited him and rather "hotted" him up.  The lenses were plano-fronted and the edges (unpolished) projected just a tad from the frame.  Finally, he caught my interest! </p><p> </p><p>By the way, I do like your fiction as well as Julian's.  Nice site.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2005, 14:26</p><p>Looking forward to hearing more, Fritz.  So, how high in the "diopter department" is your friend (and you in GOC)?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2005, 12:28</p><p> </p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>Glad you enjoyed my sightings.  I have posted here before and have always maintained that SF and Boston are great spotting grounds for optical obsessives. LA is terrible for high prescriptions.  As a matter of fact, you and I briefly corresponded several years ago.  Unfortunately, I'm only mildly myopic (-.75/-1.00)but have done some GOC with great success.  I really like to do it when I'm out of town but have begun to do it far more in SF, even going to bars where I slightly know some of the patrons. Yesterday, a guy I've known for many years and who is highly myopic asked me about my glasses.  Said he couldn' remember having seen me in them before and that it looked like I was up there with him in the "diopter department."  I'll keep posting, especially the high prescriptions I probably see once a day on average.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2005, 01:29</p><p>Fritz, your sightings sound great.  Please, keep posting them if you have more!  I don't remember seeing your postings before.  Do you wear glasses? What is your RX?  You are right, I love RXs in the -12 / -13 range... very sexy!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoff</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2005, 16:19</p><p>Sounds like Singapore is myopia heaven.  Is Lasik popular there?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2005, 08:15</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Was at dinner at a very chic South of Market restaurant (San Francisco) last week and had the delicious experience of seeing two (yes, two!) guys with at least -12s.  The first was mid-forties and quite handsome in a collegiate way with a good hair of hear and nice features.  He had on small rectangular metal frames containing plano-fronted lenses with polished edges and noticeable edge thickness.  Lots of compressed power rings.  A total turn on.  He left and the next group went to that very same table.  This guy was too heavy but would have been quite cute if he had shed about 50 pounds.  Fair hair but his facial features were somewhat distorted by his size.  Anyway, he had on small diameter metal frames (far too small for his face, incidentally, but of course useful for minimizing lens thickness).  I think they may have been slightly bi-concave but wonderfully strong -- stronger than his predecessor.  Maybe -13/14.  The restaurant is large and he always tilted his head back to see across the room.  Probably needed a prescription update.  Still, I found him hot because of those glasses!  Tinyeyes, eat your heart out!  HA!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2005, 10:06</p><p>I searched and found quite a bit of information on the internet about the myopia in Asian countries.  Here is one: </p><p><a href="http://bjo.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/85/5/521" target="_blank">http://bjo.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/85/5/521</a> </p><p> </p><p>Apparently, Singapore and Taiwan both have much higher incidence of nearsightedness than the U.S. and other western countries.  10% of the Singaporeans have high myopia (more than -6) while the figure in Western countries is 2%.   </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>T2</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2005, 03:33</p><p>Jo, I meant to ask you.  With your rx (my younger brother has -16.50 and -18) you don't say if your glasses are myodiscs but you do say that in singapore even there myodiscs are rare.  My brother's difficulty at the moment is trying to read, but I gather myodiscs would't help that.  So,do you think that singapore specs wearers have progressive lenses with a reding bit to help.  How do you manage yourself with such a high rx? </p><p>Tim.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>T2</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2005, 03:27</p><p>Jo, I've two Taiwanese friends who are both studying here.  They say that Taiwan has the most myopic population and that 95% of mediscal students there wore thick glasses.  Amongst men aged 19 -35 the propotion of high myopia is even higher.  for children a recent study shows that myopia has increased too:  12% of 6 yr olds are myopic and 84% of 16-18 yr olds have severe myopia.  It gives plenty of employment for the optical people but is deeply concerning for the future.  My friends were not even considered for military service on the grounds that they were blind - even with their glasses!  Does anyone have a legal definition of blindness because it appears to mean different things in different countries?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2005, 18:08</p><p>Jo, thanks for the Singapore info.  What a great place for me it would be!   What is your RX?  Do you really wear -30s or do you just own a pair for GOC? </p><p> </p><p>I think Hong Kong is probably similar.  Someone I used to date who now lives in Hong Kong (he is Caucasian from the U.S., by the way) is a -9.5. He told me it is very easy to walk in and get -9 disposable contacts at any shop in Hong Kong, but when he visited France they were very difficult to get.  Obviously the demand for high myopia contacts is much higher in Hong Kong.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>EX soldier</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2005, 17:23</p><p>Jo I was in stationed In Malaya for a few years used to come to Singapore for holidays, your right very many of the specks wearers are myopic, i saw very few wearers of + glasses. Shame yo can,t introduce some of you friends to the site with strong glasses your friends would be most welcome. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jo</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2005, 20:14</p><p>Since it's on the subject of singapore, let me add my 2 cents worth... I'm from singapore and it's indeed the land of myopes. Glasses wearer are a plenty and we're not short of high myopes here. anything from up to -12 is common and i've kown people who are up to -28. Sightings are a plenty, but many switch to cls once they hit their teens. But since we have such a big group of myopes here, there are still many who remain in their coke bottles.  </p><p> </p><p>Glasses are cheap in singapore probably due to its high demand and equally high supply. Optical shops are available within walking distances of each other. Hi indexes rule, and they can even go up to the -30s powers. (i know cos i have a pair) Myodisc are rare. </p><p> </p><p>On the norm, kids start wearing glasses the moment they hit school. though in recent years, sightings of preschool kids are becoming more common. I'm not sure if more  than 90% of school kids wear glasses. i don't think so, but I'm sure at least 60% are nearsighted and about 50% need glasses full time. </p><p> </p><p>In the military, we're graded by PES (Physical employment status). A will be the completly healthy soldiers usually deplyed inphysically demanding vocations  like guardsmen and commandos, and pilots etc...B are ones with minor problems which could be due to minor skin problems, myopia up to -8, slight fracture recovered etc. B is not very different from A as they will still play an active role in the military. C will be posted mostly to service vocations, like storemen, clerks, drivers. In my time, anything above -8 will be in C(not sure if they've raised it). and it goes next to Pes E and those with chronic medical problems and severe myopia (probably above the region of -15 to -28) will be here. They will serve a 2 - 21/2 years service with no reservist liabilities. Very major problems like those with heart diseases, blindness, deafness will be in F with no service liability at all. Of course, this is a very brief way of explaining and I'm sure the grading process will be more complicated, but as a rule of thumb, if you are myopic, you would easily be able to guess your PES before even they grade you. </p><p> </p><p>Generally, if you want an OO heaven, I'd reccommend Singapore which I'm sure you will not be disappointed. The sad news is, most (not all) gays are in contacts. So chances are the ones you see are probably straight.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cooper</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2005, 17:10</p><p>What is the average age that boys in Singapore start wearing glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2005, 04:01</p><p>Hey Singa, thanks for that, especially the bit about giving school kids readers to prevent myopia developing. I'll be interested to see how effective that isbut of course it'll take years, if not decades, to assess the result.. I've heard of doctors treating early myopia with plus lenses; but by the time the problem develops it's definitely too late and just causes worse vision for the kid.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2005, 22:51</p><p>Hi together </p><p> </p><p>I read yesterday in a swiss Newspaper, that in USA and Europe about 35% of all peoples are nearsighted and in Singapore 60% of all peoples, however 90% of all Singaporen students. They write, that it's also about using so much computer and close work as reading so much. They propose that can stopthis myopia if give to the children reading glasses in their childhood, that myopia can not increase so much. In Liechtenstein a school make this tests an give to all childrens with normal sight readers with about + 2.00. </p><p> </p><p>Many greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2005, 14:56</p><p>I think I'm right in saying that the majority of people in the UK have a prescription that's in the region of -3/-4. -5 is still on the high side when you're talking about averages. I heard that the highest proportion is in the -2 range.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2005, 05:10</p><p>Right. I did a quick search for 'Singapore+myopia' which produced 57 links. Japan is another place with a big myopia problem. Some authorities say it's lifestyle, some say it's genes. I'm sure it's both: if lifestyle was the only factor I'd be a high myope and not a low hyperope.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2005, 04:46</p><p>Julian- In some cases vision requirements have been eased a bit here in the U.S. Even for local municipal workers and "first-responders". Since our glorius Bush run U.S. Supreme Court has spoken on the matter,confusion still exists over the standards pertaining to hiring.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2005, 23:37</p><p>I certainly read an article online a while back that called Singapore the myopia capital of the world, and I think the statistics were similar for men and women. Certainly they've had to relax the (uncorrected) vision requirements for police, army and pilots. And did I see a reference to Taiwan being like that too?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2005, 18:19</p><p>I want to know where 90% of the women are nearsighted (average -12).  There must be someplace in the world like that, or is that OO Heaven?  8-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2005, 03:50</p><p>Hi together </p><p> </p><p>Here i more story from my holidays in Thailand. The second Happy New Year Day called Songkran me and my friend and more than 12 peoples from his family went to the river near our home for swimming. Thaipeople upcountry never take off the clothes for swimming. On this nice place on the river are so many people and of course all from this people was in wet clothes and I like to watch all those nice guys in wet jeans and shirts. While seating in earth a young men come to me and ask from where I'am. I was the only foreigner (In Thailand called Farang) in this place and Thaipeople are very curious about all. HE ask me for cigarette and I gave him a few from a people from the family. After 5 minutes he come back with a friend from him for speaking more with me. He say, that his friend have problems with his eyes and i fact this young boy 19 y.o. waer very strong plusglasses, bifocal (not only a small window in the lens) half-half from the lens and I guess more than 15 sph. The boy looked very good, nice longish black-blue hairs, wet bleu-jeans and wet white T-shirt, however his glasses are in a very old style, brown plastic, big frame (aviator style), really very ugly for this handsome boy. We not speak more about his problems with his eyes and also nothing about his glasses. I liked to ask him, if I can help him for adjusting his glasses, because they not have a good position in his face. I was not encouaged for ask him, however if I see him one time more and if he wear allway this old glasses I will help him for he can get new glasses. I think often to this boy and I try to imagine me how good (or bad) he can see. In all he looked very happy and when he walk away it not seems, that he had big problems. </p><p> </p><p>Many greeetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2005, 18:12</p><p>Just had a nice sighting as I was leaving the supermarket in my car.  Two very nice looking young men -- college age, about 20, were entering the market.  Both were athletic looking.  One was Asian and stocky.  The other was white and wearing jeans that looked very nice on him from behind.   </p><p> </p><p>Both were wearing minus glasses with rx's that weren't trivial.  I got a good glimpse of their glasses from behind -- from the glint and minification, I'd say at least -6, possibly more. </p><p> </p><p>I regretted they hadn't started shopping a little sooner.  If I were still in the store, I'm sure I'd have discovered a need for something in the aisle they were in %-) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2005, 14:56</p><p>I agree -- Singa's a hero.   </p><p> </p><p>I have a "spot and jot" -- was at the grocery store today, and just as I walked in, spotted a pair of (almost definitely gay) late 20s guys, checking out a small purchase.  One white, the other Asian, both cute, but the Asian guy had REALLY nice glasses on.   In fact, this guy was so cute (to me) that my heart was skipping a few beats and I had to get a better look, which I did (discreetly) before they left.  He had dark plastic, kind of retro-looking frames that looked really nice with his black hair and cute face.  When I first saw him, I was approaching from behind and could see the flashing look to his lenses that means -- high minus!  I wasn't disappointed with the front view -- those thick frames were holding lenses that were in the -7 or -8 range I'd guess.   Sigh---  he barely saw me and was most likey with his boyfriend anyway.   Sooo cute and sooo nearsighted ----- sighhhhhh....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2005, 01:49</p><p>Yes, Singa, I think I understand completely. And I still say as far as this thread is concerned you're a hero! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Visitboy</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2005, 15:59</p><p>Singa - Well anyone who gets a few more guys wearing glasses is doing us all a fine service! </p><p> </p><p>Nice sighting on the train home just now. Sat next to a 20-something guy wearing denim jacket and jeans with a red Adidas (I think) strap hanging from his belt and listening to music that was just loud enough to hear beyond his earphones. Well anyway, he was of course wearing glasses - I'd say about -3.00 - in a semi-rimless wire frame. Nice sighting, and only a shame not to have seen him face-to-face, although it would have been too obvious to set opposite!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2005, 13:44</p><p>Hi Julian, hi togehter </p><p> </p><p>no, Julian, I am not a hero when I give first glasses to someone, yes you remember good - it s about 1 year I do the same in Switzerland the same with someone. I am a little bit shy, however the first input to give glasses to someone it s for einjoy myself and secondary, that the boy can see better, bit I think, that I do this also if I am not a glasses fetihist. I think, that in a few year when I stay forever in Thailand I will follow many people for help, that they can see good and I will know in this time, that I make that also a little bit for me. I hope,you can understand me. Finally I can say, that the people I fit with glasses never will know about my love for glasseswearers. I am in this time very "cool". However I know, that I can do a little bit something good for people and at last also for me,why not. I hope, that you understand what I will say. </p><p> </p><p>Many greetings from Switzerland from Singa.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2005, 23:44</p><p>Singa, you really are the hero of this thread!

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2005, 23:34</p><p>Hi together </p><p> </p><p>I will post first 1 story more about my holidays in Thailand. </p><p>Thailand have about 20'000 Seven Eleven shops and I see this year the first time, that they sell finished glasses also for myopics, before they sell also readers. I was very surprised, however I saw also in Poland a few years that people sell in the market minusglasses. </p><p> </p><p>The range for lenses in the 7eleven-shops was from -1.00 to - 4.00 sph. in 0.25 steps and they habe about 10 styles of frames. </p><p> </p><p>One evening I went to 7eleven and I watch a group of young boys trying out many minusglasses. One speak: Oh, I can see well with this one" (PS: I speak and I understand the thailanguage, not perfect, however for conversation it's enough) and when I look at him, I guess, he put the strongest glasses from the display. This group have so much fun for trying out those glasses and I stay about 10 minutes in the shop and finally I buy nothing for me, because I was so exciting.  </p><p> </p><p>The price for 1 pair of this glasses was 100 Baht (about 2 USD) </p><p> </p><p>Many greetings from Singa </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2005, 03:53</p><p>Hi together </p><p> </p><p>I'am back from my holidays in Thailand and there I had many nice sightings of guys (gays) in glasses. I can not write about all, only 1 trough story. </p><p> </p><p>Me and my boyfriend went to his house in the north where we celebrated the Thailand Happy New year named Songkran a so called waterfestival, we and all other peoples going in the street was 3 days very wet. </p><p> </p><p>In the evening from the 1st songkran-day the family of my boyfriend meet together in his house, about 50 peoples, also many young guys. On from them looked so nice, he was 20 y.o. however he look same a 16 y.o. old boy, in Thailand peoples look so often more young that they are really. This boy learn in the school the english language and he was so happy to speak english with me, he thinked, that I speak very good english, but I told him, that I make many mistakes, because english is not "my" language". My boyfriend was a little bit jelous, because his nephew speak so long time with me and he not move from my side all evening. While speaking about this and that he ask me to try my glasses, however he can see nothing with them because I am hyperop. I ask him, if he can see good and he told me, that sometimes he think, that he has bad eyes. I ask him to read something about 10 meters from the place we seat together. He say to me: "Impossible to read that, it's to far for me". After speaking with my boyfriend I propose to this boy to go make a eyetest the next day to a optican in the city and he agree quickly.  </p><p> </p><p>In the morning from the next day I go take him together with my boyfriend and we went to a optical store. As I thinked, he was shortsighted and the woman from the shop gave a prescription L - 2.75 and R - 2.25. It's strong enough for not have a good sighting without glasses. The family is not so rich, that they can buy glasses so quickly and I told him, that I will pay it for him, it's seems, that he was very happy. He choose with my help a black oval plastic frame and 2 hours later we can go take his new glasses and they suit him very good, he look yet much better and I was very exciting to see him in glasses. The first hours he had problems (not so much) with his glasses, he told me that he his same drunking with this glasses. All day he not take off his glasses and in the evening when we come back all his friends will try the glasses and 1 of them told me, that he can see much better with them than without glasses. I think the next time I will go also to the optican shop with him. </p><p> </p><p>Many greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;29 May 2005, 00:20</p><p>Thanks Julian. I just like to let you all know who/what I've seen, although I know a picture would be worth at least a thousand of my words!  I don't have sightings like that every day, so I like to tell about them when I do! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 May 2005, 07:28</p><p>Tinyeyes: I always like hearing what or rather whom you've seen at the gym. Or anywhere else actually. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;27 May 2005, 23:37</p><p>More gym sightings... I guess I  go to gyms a lot, so I tend to have sightings there.  Today, it was 3 guys there at the same time, all good looking, and all with significant minus lenses.   </p><p> </p><p>First one, tall, sandy/light brown haired caucasian guy, mid thirties, nicely built and cute, if a little nerdy looking, with nice wire rims, extreme rectangle shape, flat fronts and thick edges.  Probably around -7 range. He was sweating as he worked out and once he took off his spex to wipe his brow.  Quickly put them back on before looking anywhere to avoid the blur. </p><p> </p><p>Second one, blond, thirtyish, not too tall, buff and kind of fratboyish, short hair, working out with a cute spexless (Latino?) buddy.  Blond boy had the Oakley type frames in black or a dark color, and was in the -5 or -6 range.  Worked out hard, adjusted glasses but never took them off. </p><p> </p><p>Third one, tall, hunky, late twenties white guy with shaved legs and short brown hair. Very good looking.  He looked very appearance conscious but was nevertheless wearing a pair of Clark Kentish plastic frames, very nicely shaped, with high index lenses that seemed to be around -7 or -8.  Taking a day off from contacts, I'd guess.   </p><p> </p><p>All the guys were sexy but number three was my favorite!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;20 May 2005, 23:51</p><p>Here's another tidbit you guys might enjoy.  A friend of mine (guy in his late 20s) wears strong glasses all the time, and never wears contacts.  Last week he broke his glasses, although coincidentally he recently had his eyes tested for new glasses, which are on order.  So for now, in his words, he's wearing "my highschool glasses".  His prescription is at least -9.  Today we were out in the car, and trying to find a certain street sign.  "I won't be much  help with these old glasses", he said.  I'm not sure how different his eyes are since highschool, but apparently enough to know the difference, although he is getting around and driving in the old highschool pair.  On top of that, he mentioned that one of his eyes has gotten worse with his latest eye check.  I look forward to seeing the new glasses... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;20 May 2005, 23:37</p><p>Well, fortunately, everyone isn't like that girl you overheard!  Certainly not anyone on this website!   </p><p> </p><p>There is a guy in his early 20s who works the front desk at the gym I go to frequently. He is SO cute...  tall, blondish with perfectly straight, beautiful hair, tan, nice bod, melting blue eyes, and this perfect face -- almost too perfect.  I actually think he could be a model.  Well, could it get any better? Yes, it could -- because a couple of times lately he was working in a very studious looking pair of glasses with goldish, roundish rims.  Oh my gosh, the RX wasn't so strong, probably -3 at the very most, but WOW it made this already perfect guy BETTER than perfect!  So handsome!  I guess he normally wears contacts.  I would NEVER say this guy (or most any other guy) looks better in his contacts!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;20 May 2005, 13:24</p><p>Just wanted to share a conversation I overheard the other day when I was getting my hair done.  It was Friday evening and a bunch of girls were getting their nails done for their prom.  A girl started talking about a guy named "Tom" from their school.  She said something like, "Did you see him at school yesterday.  He wasn't wearing his glasses and he looks so good."  She went on and on about how his glasses ruin his appearance.  She wants to tell him to wear his contacts all the time.  I wish there were a way I could see this "Tom" and I could make up my own mind about his appearance.  Preferring men in glasses, I would certainly insist he wear his glasses. It was interesting to hear these girls agreeing that "Tom" looked better with out his glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 May 2005, 12:18</p><p>He wasn't wearing them at the Royal Windsor Horse Show last week, when I'd have thought a myope would want some correction; nor at the royal wedding last month (when Peter Phillips was wearing his, but that's getting to be pretty usual). Possible explanations: vision not too bad, and he only needs them for driving; or of course contacts. </p><p>The problem with a Getty search is the number of shots of the premiere of Mary Poppins which was at the Prince Edward Theatre ::)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoff</b>&nbsp;16 May 2005, 18:16</p><p>Any recent sightings of the Prince in glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 May 2005, 04:01</p><p>Search Getty Images Editorial for '"Prince Edward"+glasses'. There are lots of shots taken at a premiere at the Prince Edward Theatre, but also two of the prince definitely wearing glasses at the wheel of his car and another two where I think he is wearing unobtrusive rimless glasses. They date from 1999 and 2000 - so we're a bit behind the action!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;14 May 2005, 18:54</p><p>Sorry, this isn't really the place to post that. I re-posted it elsewhere on Eyescene.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;14 May 2005, 18:51</p><p>FYI, I went to an estate sale today, here in Los Angeles area where I live.  The house had belonged to an optometrist, apparently.  I thought someone here might be interested in what they have for sale.  There were a lot of sample eyeglass frames, mostly with plano lenses or no lenses, and they were mostly from what looked like the late 1980s or early 1990s.  A mix of mens and womens but probably more mens. Also they had the display cases like you used to see to show the glasses on a wall.  Even more interesting, in the garage there was a whole setup with a vintage optometrist's chair and other equipment.  The chair looked like it was from the early 1960s, maybe even older.  I'm sure there was other testing equipment as well.  I don't have the room or use for this, but I thought I would post it in case someone does, especially if you're local.  The number is 323-256-5504, or 626-844-0025.  Personally, I think a setup like that could be very exciting to own, but I don't have the room to keep it!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cooper</b>&nbsp;14 May 2005, 12:56</p><p>Isn't Edward the bald one?  He's probably old enough for some kind of eye correction.  Will look forward to seeing a picture.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoff</b>&nbsp;14 May 2005, 09:25</p><p>What's this about Prince Edward now wearing glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hi Wayne</b>&nbsp;13 May 2005, 10:26</p><p>Thanks for the lead on "American Movie."  I borrowed it from the library.  You were right about the various angles of Mark's glasses.  Though his glasses were not as strong as I like, I bet he can't drive and deliver his newspapers without them.  You can sense that myopic gaze in the few sans-glasses scenes. </p><p> </p><p>His videographer had a strong prescription.  It was nice to see his very cute brother in glasses.  I'd be willing to bet that his other brother is the real myope in the family.  His eyes had that look that screamed "very strong contacts." </p><p> </p><p>I'd recommend checking out "American Movie."  Does anyone know of any other movies that feature Guys in Glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VisitBoy</b>&nbsp;11 May 2005, 15:24</p><p>On the Tube this evening I noticed a very cute guy, late-twenties or thirty, wearning an orange flurorescent "Metronet" jacket. Nice face, and hair quite short. Nice shiny silver metal frames, well-suited to his face, with lots of cut-in. From a distance I'd say about minus six or more, but alas I sat some distance away and he alighted next stop.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;09 May 2005, 18:47</p><p>My guess is about -4.50.  A friend of mine who wears this rx, has a pair of glasses that he got for free, as part of a buy one/get one deal.  The free pair was from the "value collection" and is big and ugly and has regular plastic lenses that look similar in prescription to Mark Borchardt's.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;09 May 2005, 16:33</p><p>I'd even be surprised at -6.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;09 May 2005, 13:46</p><p>Mattp.  I agree that his rx is not super high.  I'd guess around -6, judging from cut-in, power rings and minification of his eyes and the scenery looking through them from behind -- and based on my many years of glasses watching prior to hi-index and the fact that my rx was around -6 back then %-).   </p><p> </p><p>The pictures seem to range from 1994 to 1997.  The hi-index lenses began to become available and then gradually started replacing the thicker lenses during that period.  I suspect he got hi-index lenses at some point as there isn't a lot of edge thickness in some of the pictures.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mattp</b>&nbsp;09 May 2005, 05:44</p><p>Can anyone hazard a guess as to Mark Borchardt's RX?  I like the big, thick lenses, but I suspect his RX may not be all that strong--with minus prescriptions, the bigger the lens, the thicker the edges; also, these pictures may be from 1994, pre high index days?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;08 May 2005, 21:12</p><p>I rented a movie last night based entirely on the picture on the cover.  It's an independent film called "American Movie".  The author, director and star of the movie, is a young, late twenties, tall and lanky working class guy from Milwaukee, Wisconsin named Marc Borchardt.  I found the film not worth watching except for Marc and his big strong glasses in plastic aviator style frames.  You see his glasses from every possible angle, the cut-ins, the power rings, the view from behind.  He has a habit of pushing his glasses up with his hand every so often while he's talking. </p><p>   </p><p>Here's a couple of links.

<p><b>mattp</b>&nbsp;02 May 2005, 06:03</p><p>Interesting double sighting at a rest stop on the interstate yesterday.  Nice looking family with two boys, the older 12ish, the younger about 8 or 9.  The mother and older son were bare eyed, but the father and younger son wore fairly hefty plus glasses (I'm no judge of plus lens' strength, but these were considerably thicker than the frames and magnified the eyes nicely). </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, here's the point.  The father was in his thirties and wore black metal rectangular frames that complemented nicely his angular features and dark hair.  Obviously someone in the family has some taste.  Thus I find it hard to explain the glasses on the 9-year old.  Huge round gray metal frames that covered most of his cheeks as well as his eyes, maqgnifying his face as well as his eyes.  All you saw were glasses and these huge eyes.  The kid was active and not at all self-conscious of the glasses, but I felt sorry for him--his face just shrieked glasses, glasses, glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>don</b>&nbsp;01 May 2005, 13:08</p><p>Well, are are all a bit pervy... </p><p> </p><p>I think there's a big difference between watching for a moment or two while the guy finds his glasses and not helping a disabled person back into their wheelchair. Apart from anything else, the guy might have been embarrassed to have his glasses found by a stranger - it would have meant someone was aware of his predicament. </p><p> </p><p>I wish I'd been there :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ed</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2005, 22:48</p><p>I had a sighting a couple of years ago in a nearby shopping mall  that was also memorable. He was a guy who couldnt have been any more than 17 or 18 years old and was wearing thick glasses with rectangular frames. My best guess is that his prescription looked to be something like -15 from the brief view of the cut-in and power rings. That mall has been a victim of suburban sprawl and new fancier malls. And it was early on a weekday before the stores opened so there couldnt have been more than a half dozen other people there at the time, and no one other than him and me in the part where I was at the time.  At one point he took off his glasses and wiped off the lenses with his shirt while he was still walking. He was about to put them back when he stumbled. He managed to keep from falling down, but his glasses had slipped out of his hands. They hit the floor and  came to rest about 10 ft in front of him, maybe a little less than that. He let out a little gasp, then carefully got on his knees and  started to feel along the floor with his hands, obviously unable to see where his glasses were. Instead of offering to help him, for some reason I just had to watch. Sort of like driving by a car wreck. Besides, it was over a couple of minutes later when one of his hands brushed against his glasses. He had to have been pretty upset because his hands trembled a little as he put his glasses on. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2005, 22:08</p><p>Thought I'd throw in some "memorable" sightings -- some fairly recent, some even a few years ago. </p><p> </p><p>Teen, 16 or so, shopping with his parents in a supermarket but wandering off on his own.  He wasn't wearing glasses but caught my attention when I noticed him leaning close to see things, bending down or standing on tiptoe to within a few inches to find things on the shelf.  Later I found him sitting by the magazine rack holding magazines very close to read them.  Later he was wandering around looking for his family until they (now at the checkstand) called to him and scolded him for not catching up with them.  His remark was "I couldn't see you" -- received with skepticism although the mother was wearing a strong enough rx that she should have understood. </p><p> </p><p>Young man, 19 or so, wearing fairly strong and very dark sunglasses, maybe -6,  shopping with family in Wal-Mart.  He was trying to read a price on a box and couldn't see it because of the darkness of his glasses.  So he took the glasses off and leaned quite close to read it. </p><p> </p><p>Man -- 35 or so, cute, short chunky &amp; muscular -- shopping late at nite in the supermarket wearing very strong (-13?) glasses with thick lenses in great big old-fashiouned plastic frames.  The glasses kept sliding down his nose and he'd hold them close to his face to see things on a shelf below him.  (I kept hoping they'd fall off so I could help him find them  %-).  The glasses were probably old and I suspect he wore them to run to the store without having to put his contacts back in. </p><p> </p><p>Nerdy looking guy, 30 or so, working out at the gym with big, thick glasses, possibly -6.5.  Later he came into the sauna with only his shorts on and without his glasses and sat across from me (lovely myopic stare from those big blue bare eyes).  He was looking at me with a very cute sort of squint -- not screwing up his eyes or making them slits, but sort of pulling the skin around his eyes back -- I suspect he was self-conscious about too obviously squinting at me.  He was very good looking with his clothes off and I thought he might be cruising me.  Unfortunately, I left the sauna for a moment to get some water and he was gone when I got back.  (A "one that got away" story, I guess.) </p><p> </p><p>To be continued. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;25 Apr 2005, 12:47</p><p>well Julian - first and foremost I was interested in the glasses - but hey if he comes with them it's an added bonus!! lol ; )</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;25 Apr 2005, 07:18</p><p>Wow saw the fittest man today whilst shopping. He was wearing the strongest pair of minus glasses I've seen in a long time (if ever!). Wouldn't like to guess as to RX but the concentric lines were many and cuts ins very dramatic. Maybe around -15 or so? Nice pair of simple black 'matt' not shiney frames - probably designer, really added to his face. I kept looking at him to get a glimpse as to the glasses and I think he was thinking I was eyeing him up!!</p><p></p><hr>

The Queen herself wears glasses quite a lot (bifocals with a plus Rx I think0 and for decades I've been hearing the Duke of Edinburgh's contact lenses mentioned. And one of the Gloucester princes wears glasses - whether it's William or Richard I can't remember. Finally, I've an idea I've seen pictures of the Countess of Wessex in specs.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2005, 16:31</p><p>Eustace: David Llewellyn gave a very clear explanation of how a hyperopic eye works in a couple of posts on 13 February 2004; one was on the 'Strong glasses' thread, the other I'm not sure where, but I have copies of them both. If you have trouble finding them, let me have your email address and I'll send the text to you (but probably not till next week as I'm going to be away). </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hansel</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2005, 15:06</p><p>I think the term "far-sighted" tends to confuse understanding. In both long and short sight the issue is the fact that the point of focus on the retina is not where it needs to be, in the case of short sight the image focus is in front of the retina, behind for the long sighted eye. Each effect has certain characteristics, but blur is probably the common factor. </p><p>Thus apake Hansel, but I do find that there are more clued in posters than me who will be able to compile a more comprehensive reply.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eustace</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2005, 14:45</p><p> </p><p>There is still a lot about Rx that I don't understand.  When are plus lenses prescribed for distance vision?  Somehow, I always thought plus lenses were to correct farsightedness and improve close vision (like for reading); but I see so many posts from guys that have plus Rx for distance.  Can someone give me a simple explanation?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2005, 22:30</p><p>I was at the gym today and saw a really cute guy working out.   When I first saw him he was wearing strong-looking minus rimless glasses, but he took them off and started some sets on one of the resistance weight machines.  I kept waiting for him to put his glasses back on, but he continued to go without them.  Working out in his own little world -- I could tell he couldn't focus on anything past his immediate area.  His nearsightedness really became obvious when he had to change the weight on the weight machine, as he bent down very close to see the weight numbers on the machine.  I kept waiting, but he never put those glasses on again.  He even carried them to other areas of the gym to do other exercises.  I guess he just enjoys being bare-eyed in public.  Extremely sexy/spexy!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2005, 10:01</p><p>Also, Jo, and anonymous question-asker: </p><p>What type of glasses and prescriptions do you have?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2005, 09:59</p><p>Speaking of eye exams, does anyone have any advice on how to find the best place to get your eyes examined?  I have heard that some opticians are using new computerized machines that test your eyes automatically somehow. Does anyone know about this?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2005, 09:56</p><p>I think I need to visit Singapore soon!  To answer the question, I chose the name not just because of my own prescription but because I love guys with high minus glasses and "tinyeyes" so much.  </p><p> </p><p>My prescription is -8.  I must admit that I wear contacts most of the time though.  I've been chided for this by other OOs.  The reason is a combination of the fact that I really do see better with contacts, and the fact that I am embarrassed to have such a strong prescription.  At the same time, I'm obsessed with strong prescriptions on other guys (and myself.)  I love being a high myope and I would not want to have 20/20 vision, but I also love my RGP contacts.   </p><p> </p><p>My current glasses, which I wear at home and occasionally when I go out, are dark plastic frames with high index lenses.  They are not visibly thick, and probably only another optic obsessive would notice the high prescription.  I actually am due for an eye exam and new contacts and glasses, so I will probably be taking care of that soon.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jo</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2005, 07:56</p><p>i'm from singapore... and indeed, sg is a major OO fetish heaven...it's rated as one of the most highly myopic country in the world, along with hk, taiwan...and most of the prescriptions are quite high too. Double digits are pretty common though the average prescription would be around -4 to -8.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Question for Tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2005, 07:15</p><p>With a name like that, you yourself must be pretty nearsighted.  What's your RX, what kind of frames do you wear, and how do you feel about needing strong glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brett</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2005, 06:07</p><p>While on the subject of Singapore, found a great optician in the main shopping district (Orchard Road).  Frames in Singapore are significantly cheaper than at home in South Africa. My partner (who has a very low RX) purchased three pairs there and I managed to convince him that the rimless ones would look better with thicker lenses.  We asked the optician to make the lenses as thick as possible, although puzzled (he advised that his clients usually ask for thinner lenses) he agreed to ensure they were as thick as possible.  Upon collection 4 days later, found the lenses to be 6mm (almost quarter inch) thick.  Needless to say, that did major things to this voyeuristic optics obsessive and luckily my boyfriend seems to like wearing them more often than any his others. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brett</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2005, 05:57</p><p>I spent the first two weeks of March in Singapore which proved a real treat with seemingly every second guy wearing glasses, almost always minus.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2005, 22:56</p><p>Yes, I think SF (and Boston too I'm sure, though I've never had the pleasure) are both more "bookish" places than most.  I think guys are less inclined to be wearing contacts than in appearance-conscious places like Los Angeles.  But I still love L.A.! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ftitz</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2005, 07:43</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I agree with TinyEyes about San Francisco being a spexy town.  Wearing thick or thickish glasses doesn't seem to bother people as much up here.  I've noticed the same phenomenon in Boston where you will see a lot of good-looking guys wearing glasses in excess of -6.  One of my favorite young guys where I work out just got new (and stronger) rimless glasses and looks terrific in them.  He'll take them off when he's walking from his locker to the shower, but at -4 he looks a bit vague when he walks around without them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2005, 15:49</p><p>Just returned from a visit to San Francisco, a city where you really get to do a lot of people watching (because you're out on foot and not stuck in a car all the time!)  Lots of spexy guys.  This is the age of the rimless frame.  I saw lots and lots of strong minus RXs in thckish rimless styles.  Many, many cute Asian guys, especially, in strong glasses! </p><p>Definitely a sexy, spexy town. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2005, 12:59</p><p>More I'd say - the there's some impact of the lenses on the image in the right eye. At close range I'd guess that to be around -2.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2005, 15:07</p><p>Hi All </p><p> </p><p>Took a daytrip to France today. Was absolutely amazed about all the guys with glasses in a shopping centre there, mostly all younger guys. I tended to notice that the vast majortiy of these were minus prescriptions, however there were a few plus glasses there. It has started me wondering why there are so many people with glasses in France, seemingly a lot more than here in the UK. Most of these guys had chosen their frames well, I saw so many that I can't remember any particular one that clearly to go into detail. Guess I need to make notes, Julian!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Theory for Visitor</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2005, 12:33</p><p>Another theory about your husband's prescription might be that his myopia improved.  A good friend of mine has worn glasses since childhood with a quite strong prescription of around -8.  When he started having problems in his mid30s he thought that he needed stronger glasses with a bifocal.  It turned out that he needed a weaker prescription and no bifocal. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-oo-</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2005, 08:32</p><p>myopic contact lens prescriptions are usually a little less than the glasses prescription. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Visitor</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2005, 06:09</p><p>I adore sexy guys who wear glasses.  I am lucky enough to have married my college sweetheart who has worn glasses since the age of 12.  </p><p> </p><p>When I first met him (14 years ago) his prescription was around -3.50 but now all is contact lens boxes say -2.75 and -2.50 (He's 38).  </p><p> </p><p>He says he  need his glasses or contacts fulltime but from what I can tell this is a pretty weak prescription. Can anyone tell me why his eyes seemed to have improved or is he just being undercorrected? He still seems to have quite a few power rings in his glasses. I'm confused. </p><p> </p><p>He's absolutely gorgeous and especially when wearing his specs and of course I tell him that.   </p><p> </p><p>I'm also glasses and contacts wearer but only part-time with plus 1's. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dillusionbr</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2005, 11:35</p><p>A severely myopic guy's online diary with photographs: my<a href="http://waringo.fatalexception.de/History_Michel.html" target="_blank">http://waringo.fatalexception.de/History_Michel.html</a> </p><p> </p><p>He got his first glasses at the age of 5, and judging from the pics, his myopia progressed in giant leaps until he was 13. Then he was fitted with contact lenses, -11 and -12 diopters! </p><p>After that, his eyesight hasn't deteriorated much. In one diary entry in 2001 he mentions that a squash ball hit him in his -13 diopter left eye, fortunately without any permanent damage -- he says that he felt like having -30 diopters when he was on the way back home from the eye doctor, because he wasn't able to wear the lens in the affected eye, nor did he have his glasses with him, plus the temporary damage to his vision that the hit had caused. </p><p> </p><p>I think it's really a shame that he stopped wearing his powerful glasses in public... </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

The boy had a weak plusprescription, I guess, not more than plus 1.00 dptr. however I think, more than 15 prism, basis outside and the lenses was really very thick, mabe 1 1/2 cm both sides in small, oval, little bit rectangluar, silver metalframe. About the prismn basis out the lenses gave a big cut-in (same as minuslenses) and they had many nice rings deep in the glasses. </p><p>The boy was mediumsized with brown hairs and brown eyes, not very handsome, however about the glasses interesting enough for watch him, he had a very nice smile and very nice, white theets (thoots???) and it seem, that him not was unhappy with his glasses, he allway joking with his parents?? and not stop the speak, speak, speak. A very nice sighting. </p><p> </p><p>Than in the same shop a other young man (about 20 y.o)with anisometropic glasses, one side minus and the other plus, not strong, mabe 1.50 with a lot of cylinder, very interesting glasses and also him look handsome, short blond hairs and dark eyes (the hairs mabe colored). He wear wide, black cargojeans and a skiingjacket in red color.The frame in plastic, black color in a ovalstyle, a little bit same Oakley, however not with the straight earpieces. </p><p> </p><p>Many greetings from  </p><p> </p><p>Singa </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

What a nice valentines day present! </p><p> </p><p>What are imperial earpieces? </p><p> </p><p>I also have a sighting to contribute: Business lunch last week with a new programmer: very tall strapping young man (big beefy handshake!) dark hair &amp; eyes, engaging smile and med-strong (+2ish) semi-rimless oblong rectangular glasses: there was a bit of bump out on the side - not so much as to distort his face at all, but enough to notice, and I suppose enough cylindar so that my view through his lenses (from across the table) prevented any inversion or sharpness in the distance behind him (does that make any sense?) He was very sweet and funny telling us his stories of skiing and hiking (mis)adventures, and was on very very good behaviour with very cautious table manners. Sadly, he is much too young for me! </p><p> </p><p>The funny thing was, all of us at the table were wearing our plus glasses except the boss, who was doing his usual leaning his head way back to read the menu and the check!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2005, 04:16</p><p>Hello again all together </p><p> </p><p>Last saturday i went to the carneval in the city and i have a lot of nice spexy sightings. One of that is the follow: A young, very handsome asian boy (I guess about 20 years old) with short black hairs, black jeans and because of strong raining in a dark blue rubber jacket (looked very sexy). He wear a black oval frame with middle strong minuslenses, i think about -5 sph. both sides and a red baseball cap, i like glasses togehter with baseball caps. And he had also make a changing on his glasses, I think the optican cut the plasticearpieces and fitted them with imperial earpieces with rubber in red color. I like so much these earpieces, these look so very sexy on the wearers. Some people here like also these earpieces? </p><p> </p><p>Many greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2005, 22:08</p><p>I had some nice sightings this weekend.  I went to an event where there were a lot of guys, and plenty of time to watch them standing around in line.   Lots of cute guys with glasses, some with prescriptions on the stronger side, but I had a favorite.  There was an Asian guy, mid 20s probably, average height, kind of cute, with very strong minus glasses.   His wire-rims had an RX of maybe -10 or -11 I'm guessing.  He did a lot of peering into the distance, and a couple of times I caught him squinting a little (with his already narrow eyes, which were made tiny by his powerful, rather thick lenses.)  Maybe it was time for an optomerist visit and another diopter or so?  Very spexy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2005, 05:20</p><p>royboy: I agree on the whole. In both cases I've browsed round the albums these pics come from. Jon's Rx (#2 &amp; 3) is certainly low. In Adam's case (#1) some of the other pics suggest -5 or even more rather then -4. He is certainly myopic - and cute with it! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mattp</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2005, 05:33</p><p>For those of you who get HGTV (house and garden television channel on cable), take a look at Design on a Dime.  One of the carpenters, a young man named Spenser, wears pretty thick lenses in heavy black frames.  What's interesting are the camera angles as he works on projects--good side views, times when he's shot from behind and the viewer can look through his lenses, times when he scrunches up his nose to look through the lenses better at things over his head.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2005, 22:23</p><p>One more thing: regarding the guysglasses yahoo groups.  These are not high volume email groups and only the most recent is active at all.  Pictures are posted in the photos section, not attached to email.  A new group is created when the space allotted for pictures by yahoo is used up.  It's worth joining the earlier groups to see the pictures.  I choose to receive the email as there is usually a notice when someone adds pictures to the galleries, but you can just check in every so often and read any posted messages on the website. </p><p> </p><p>The youngmeninglasses group is a different story.  There's a lot of email with image attachments.  It's worth it for some occasionally spectacular glasses pix but there's also a lot of non-rx sunglasses pix.  I have wondered if the moderator is trying to avoid the glasses fetish image or genuinely likes seeing guys wearing glasses frames, rx lenses or not. </p><p> </p><p>There are also a couple of "nerd" groups which often have pictures of guys wearing glasses (part of the nerd image).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2005, 22:08</p><p>Here's an interesting link: </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.ducey.com/life990628.html" target="_blank">http://www.ducey.com/life990628.html</a> </p><p> </p><p>It's a young man's description of his journey to laser surgery.  Not a happy story for us but worth it for his description of his life as a very nearsighted glasses wearer since early childhood, his fears about the surgery and his angst about losing part of his identity (as a glasses wearer).  There are also many nice pictures of him in glasses at various stages of his life. </p><p> </p><p>Sadly, for us, he went through with the surgery.  Fortunately, for him, it went well and he's happy with the results. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2005, 22:02</p><p>Hi everyone, </p><p> </p><p>I'm glad so many enjoyed my grocery store clerk sighting, it was one of the best I've experienced. </p><p> </p><p>I've got another grocery store sighting -- not quite as spectacular.  A few months ago I noticed a young man around 20 bagging in a supermarket wearing fairly strong (probably about -6.5 )glasses.  Although most likely straight, he was quite cute, slim with blue eyes, curly hair and sort of nerdy looking plastic frames. </p><p> </p><p>Recently, to my disappointment, he got contacts.  I can see why as he was really transformed from nerd to handsome (from the point of view of those without our superior tastes)  I had noticed that he'd seemed to have difficulty getting used to the contacts -- blinking a lot and looking uncomfortable. Tonight I saw him back in glasses (a new, wirerimmed pair).  A disappointment for him I'm sure as he is likely self-conscious about wearing glasses but couldn't function without correction. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2004, 01:14</p><p>Hi together </p><p> </p><p>Last evening I go by train to the city near my home. The next station where the train stop I saw trought the windows and very handsome guy with glasses, hoping, that he come in the same wagoon as I seat. Good luck, he come seat opposite me and I had a good place for watching him. I see something on him, what I can not see very often. The young men was about 22 y.o. with short, brown hairs. He was well dressed with a white shirt, brown pullover, brown leather jacket and black Levis, as I can see and of course he wear glasses. And what kind of glasses, as I say before: A black, not small wire frame, a little bit aviator style and what I can see he was anysometropic. The left side, mabe - 3 sph. and the right side I guess, more than - 7 sph. and this lens was a bifocal lens, only on the right side. I remember that I saw a similar glasses (only 1 side bifocal) before only 1 time. I was very exiting while watching this nice guy (mabe he was also gay) Unfortunately or fortunately the trainriding goes only a few minutes. Hope to see this guy an other time, however I think, that normally he wear contactlenses, because with lenses he will have a much better sight. </p><p> </p><p>Many greetings from Singa, especially also for Julian.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2004, 00:23</p><p>Eustace: I have joined all the 'guysglasses' groups as they've been set up. I always specify "No email' amd I never get any. Of course they're worth joining; with so many photos of spexy guys the quality varies - of course! - but there are some real dreams of guys there.  </p><p>I agree with you; when I see there's a post from Tinyeyes I can expect a worthwhile sighting. And the same goes for Singa. Keep it up, boys! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eustace</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2004, 17:25</p><p> </p><p>I so much enjoyed Wayne's sighting of the grocery store clerk and Tinyeyes' sighting of his airplane seat mate.  Both turn-ons and well written!  I like to think that I am quite alert to  </p><p>guys in glasses--and I do work on a University campus; but I just don't seem to have the luck that some of you guys have. </p><p> </p><p>Did any of you notice that that Bill Hemmer (that winsome co-anchor person on "American Morning") was bare-eyed the week or so he was "on location" telecasting from Japan?  I was so distressed, for I think he is so much cuter in his little rimless specs!  I was afraid that maybe he had had laser surgery.  But I was pleased to see that when he returned to New York, he was wearing his glasses again.  I wonder why he was bare-eyed in Japan? </p><p> </p><p>I had no idea that there were so many Yahoo Guys in Glasses groups.  I am signed up only for the first three.  Are the others worth the bother--and all the e-mail one receives, even though one specifies "no e-mail"?  </p><p> </p><p>Eustace</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2004, 15:32</p><p>I think the last posting is a case where giving would truly be better than receiving! </p><p> </p><p>I have a wonderful sighting to report.  Today I traveled back from my trip home for the holidays.  As I arrived at my gate at the airport, I was taken aback by the sight of a tall, handsome blond guy, about 30 years old and wearing impossible-to-ignore high minus glasses.  I wanted to get a better look at him without being too obvious, so as he sat down, I noted where he sat, and went off to go buy a magazine before the flight.   </p><p> </p><p>By the time I came back, he was gone and people were starting to board our plane. I boarded the plane and slowly made my way toward my seat near the back of the plane, looking around of course for Mr. tall and high minus.  Believe it or not, as I neared my seat, I saw him, and sure enough, he was my seatmate!  There he was, right next to me.  Imagine: Me, a gay guy with a HUGE glasses fetish, contemplating spending the next 3 hours sitting just inches away from a cute, slightly nerdy looking guy with gorgeous thick glasses! Unfortunately, (or maybe fortunately) he definitely seemed to be straight, and wasn't particularly friendly.  But he didn't seem to notice me stealing glances at him all through the flight!   </p><p>I'm not sure where to begin here, but maybe I'll just make a stream of consciousness list......</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2004, 12:26</p><p>A sighting.  There was a young man -- probably mid-20's, very cute -- checking at a local natural foods store.  He was wearing very strong glasses in very small wire-rim frames.  The minus Rx had to be in the high double-digits.  The hi-index lenses had a noticable edge thickness.  With the tiny frames you could get a good idea how he'd look without the glasses from the side.  From the front the eyes looked very very small and a lot of cut-in was visible.  The glasses slid down his nose a little but he didn't bother to push them up.  With the strong Rx and tiny frames, this would cause things to appear even smaller and give him a kind of tunnel vision. </p><p> </p><p>When he looked at me to tell me the total, I looked up and smiled at him and he smiled back.  It was a wonderful view from the front with those tiny eyes behind the strong lenses.  I think he'd be pretty much helpless without them.   </p><p> </p><p>I'm surprised he wasn't wearing contacts.  I suspect he usually does.  I may have seen him before without the glasses -- but wouldn't have paid as much attention in that case.  If he wears the continuous wear contacts, this may have been the one day a week he has to leave them out.  That's the one good thing about continuous wear contacts, you get to see the guy in glasses once every week or two if you're lucky.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2004, 03:34</p><p>Sunday many of shops are open about christmas time, so I go also shopping in a big shopping center near my home and I had a lot of nice sightings, I will report only this, about it was very amazing. When I leave my car in the parking I saw a family with 2 young boys. The elderly mabe 19 .. 20 and the younger, I guess 17 .. 18 y.o. Both looked very handsome and both boys wear glasses. The elderly a oval wire frame with about + 2.00 sph. however the younger boy had about both sides + 5 or 6 sph pluslenses in a oval, brown plastic frame and he wear his glasses down on the nose same as a reading glasses and this fact was amazing for me. He allway look in the far upper his glassesm, not trough the lenses. I saw him inb about i hour several times from different sides. I wish, that he not wear his glasses like a reading glasses, thats look a little bit stupid on him, however it's was a very handsome boy with short brown hairs, brown eyes and he wear nice brown, manchester jeans and a brown leather jacket. I can not see a reason, why he wear his glasses like that. </p><p> </p><p>Many greeetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VisitBoy</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2004, 15:10</p><p>An interesting experience with a good-looking and apparently confident acquaintance of mine, earlier. </p><p> </p><p>He looked at some lights in the distance and commented that they appeared fuzzy. Asking him to read something else, he asked "Could I try your glasses?" I must have looked a little surprised, 'cos he asked "Oh, are they strong?" I replied that they're "middling" and offered them to him to try on. He put them on (and looked good with them) and replied when I asked that everything appeard blurred. No surprise there then, for someone who's probably just starting outas a myope. </p><p> </p><p>Nice incident, though!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;13 Dec 2004, 22:01</p><p>Well, the rimless glasses in high minus can be pretty cute on the right guy...  you are right, Myopeman.  But I guess I remember the days (not so long ago) when high minus prescriptions wouldn't work in rimless design frames.  I think the technology has changed.  It just throws me off, because sometimes the lenses are pretty thick with rimless, but the prescription isn't really that strong after all.... and that's what's kind of disappointing when I realize it!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopeman</b>&nbsp;12 Dec 2004, 02:29</p><p>I love rimless high-minus! I saw this kid the other day who had oval rimless specs; he was dark-skinned, with very short black hair, snub nose, and his lenses were so deliciously powerful. The rings look kind of different when they are compressed so much. I wondered: how does this boy find his glasses once he puts them down? Unless they are in exactly the same place every morning, he must do an awful lot of patting down of empty surfaces! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;12 Dec 2004, 01:01</p><p>Just a general comment: I'm noticing that people with higher and higher minus prescriptions are getting rimless frames.  I was at a party today and there was a guy with rimless glasses that were at least -8 and were actually pretty thick.  Personally, I much prefer regular frames on the higher prescriptions.  </p><p></p><hr>

To minimize fog, put a 50/50 mixture of baby shampoo and water on the goggles just before swimming. It works better than spit for me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VisitBoy</b>&nbsp;10 Dec 2004, 02:12</p><p>I wear goggles, although I've met a few others who've referred to wearing contacts under goggles. I can't see that well, I guess because the lenses aren't alligned as well as with my glasses, but they help a bit when they're not fogged up. Need to use the anti-fog stuff every time, methinks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VisitBoy</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2004, 13:23</p><p>I had a nice sighting this evening, walking home. An attractive and very tall (6 ft 8?) guy, casually dressed and with neat dark blonde hair was heading for the station. He had good minus lenses, rounded, high-index I think, in a small-to-medium metal frame. Didn't get to face him straight on, as we went separate ways after a short while. :(</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David_Llewellyn</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2004, 10:24</p><p>OK, the pressure is too much, I'll contribute a sighting! Undoubtedly straight guy on the J-Church streetcar near Market in San Francisco. Longish dark hair (but not so long as mine!), blue eyes, maybe 22. Had unfortunately the typical youth-in-public slightly hostile look. The nice feature was HUGE round (totally circular, probably 54mm eyesize) glasses, ~ -3 D, basically the same ones worn by Peter Jackson (director of "Lord of the Rings")... but Jackson is huge, this guy wasn't. It was very pleasing to see a young guy NOT wearing rectangles and gives me hope that the rectangle era is ending. </p><p>=============== </p><p>All these sightings makes it clear that if you want to see people, GET OUT OF YOUR CAR and onto transit!

<p><b>eric</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2004, 06:49</p><p>I do a lot of swimming - some competitively, and my Rx is -10.50.

<p><b>VisitBoy</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2004, 03:24</p><p>I had a nice sighting at the swimming pool this week. A well-built but not over-muscular guy came into the changing rooms, probably from the gym, looking lovely in t-shirt and shorts with nice legs. Of course, he was wearing glasses, of the plastic/laminate type in two colours, and had a healthy number of minus dioptres. After pulling his bag out of the locker, he stripped all of his clothes off and lastly removed his glasses and left them on top of his clothes before going off to the showers. I would love to have tried those glasses on, or to have struck up conversation. </p><p> </p><p>He put the glasses back on fairly swiftly after returning from the shower, and seemed to depend on them quite a lot. He took them off again only to do his hair at the mirrors on the way out. </p><p> </p><p>I've noticed a couple of people swimming with glasses on, which seems rather inconvenient to me. Others do their own GOC: Goggles over contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

I've used the search function on Yahoo groups for 'guys in glasses' and it says there's no such group. That may not be true; I think they have some weird policy about 'adult' groups, or ones that might have some fetish contenct. I also checked 'guysglasses' and it said 'not found' although there are seven groups of that name. Was it one of those? If so, which? </p><p>If you want you can email me about this: julianmungo(at)yahoo(dot)co(dot)uk </p><p>Finally, if the guy's name was Tamas, he's about as straight as a corkscrew, Nice though. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mary J</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2004, 04:06</p><p>Hello guys! I saw the pics of a very good looking guy with strong rx glasses in the yahoo groups Guys in Glasses. He has dark hair and eyes, about 25yo, handicapped in wheelchair. Do any of you know him? Is he straight? How can I get in contact with him?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2004, 23:59</p><p>Katy: that's another kind of sighting - how old is he by the way? I was in a meeting this week where I noticed two colleagues doing exactly the same thing - looking over or under their glasses to read something. Both of them fifty-ish. One whom I know quite well was wearing new rimless glasses in place of gunmetal ovals (or contacts), quite a low Rx and he'd have the option of taking his specs off to read. The other I hadn't met before; he's quite good looking with short hair and beard, a bit of grey in each, and dark wire frames with much stronger lenses. Actually I was quite surprised that at their age they were still in single vision lenses - but I was sure they were. I felt inclined to whisper to both of the, "Bifocal time, boy!" - but of course I didn't. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2004, 23:48</p><p>OK tinyeyes, the big question: were YOU wearing your glasses, or contacts? And the other thing is, your sightings have never bored me yet. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2004, 22:36</p><p>OK... I have a sighting.  I need to post more of my sightings.  I don't want to bore people though!  Anyway, I spotted a guy with what seemed to be strong-looking glasses in the locker room at the gym yesterday.  He was a good looking, tall, well-built, light-skinned Black guy.  Just as I got a better look at him and realized that, WOW, his glasses were quite high minus, he started taking off his shirt and took off his glasses. For an instant I saw his bare-eyed gaze, his eyes obviously too nearsighted to see much.   He quickly put his glasses back on. Every time I tried to look at his eyes and glasses, he looked right back at me.  Then I realized, OH, OK, this guy is GAY and he's looking back at me and kinda flirting!   About that time I had to go, so that's the end of the story for now!  But his glasses were in the -7 or -8 range.  Quite spexy!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2004, 17:05</p><p>Ok, Was waiting for the subway, and spied a nice looking black guy - stocky, very creamy nice skin, leather coat, close cropped hair, waiting &amp; reading the paper - looking thru rectangular hornrim glasses that were probably around +2.50. For some reason I thought that he would  take them off as soon as the train came, even tho he was likely in his early 30s, but a few minutes later he boarded the train right behind me wearing them and not squinting in the distance. </p><p> </p><p>Then later on, I was in a store, and the guy ahead of me, thin, in his 40s, dark thinning hair and rather narrow wire frames holding + lenses strong enough not to be blurry when looked thru from about 6 feet away and with enough cyl to tilt all the lines pretty well diagonally except at the bottom where the striated lines made an arc, so I assume there was some add there.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2004, 15:17</p><p>Jules, Myopeman - ok then :-) My boyfriend's brother (I know I shouldn't look but can't help it!) has glasses that are about -5 or 6. He has got nice semi-rimless ones and of course he wears them all the time so after a while I forget he is wearing them. But he can't see up close with them on so every time he wants to read something he lifts it up, tips his head back and looks at it under his glasses. He holds it about 4 inches away :-) It is so incredibly sexy because it is so obvious that that is as far as he can focus. Mmmmmmm. I'm sure he will get bifocals next time he has a test so I'm enjoying it while I can :-) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2004, 14:40</p><p>Ahhh yes...that cute little squint as he tried to see something just out of range - and the fierce struggle to see where the next bus is going ::)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2004, 07:41</p><p>Hi together </p><p> </p><p>Last saturday in the early morning I drive with my car to my offic and beside of the set I saw a young boy watching very close with hes eyes the horary from the Bus. First I not see that him wear glasses and I thinked he is a myopic without glasses. After I stop my car a few meters from him and go to the small newspapershop only for watch him. After buying my newspaper I look at him and I saw, that him wear strong plusglasses (about 6-8 with I cab guess a lot of cylinder in a black oval frame. He ask me, if I know when the next bus go the the nigbored village and I look with him again the horary however also together we not understand about this. I ask him, where he go exactly and he gave me the name of the Restaurant who he learn cooking. He agree my offer and I bring him there and try to speak him many times in this 5 - minutes - ride that I can look him many times. He was about 19 y.o. with short brown hairs, he wear jeans and jeansjacket, he was so sweet. I think, that with his glasses hot have a good sighting, because he go so near for reae the horary, however I was shy for ask him something about his eyes, his e looks same he have crossed eyes and that his glasses help him only for certain bether sight, however not for a 100% good sight. When he leave my car he smile very friendly, however his eyes not looked at me. I hope, that in future he can see much better and that he not will have more troubles with his big brown eyes behind his very nice and sexy eyeglasses. </p><p> </p><p>Greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2004, 03:16</p><p>Myopeman - mmmmm. I know this thread is for blokes but that one was brilliant.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Will</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2004, 15:31</p><p>Saw a lovely guy in a bathhouse in Sydney today, half-Chinese with black plastic glasses and lots of cut-in. In fact there are quite a few guys with glasses at this bathhouse.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopeman</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2004, 04:19</p><p>I should have mentioned another nice sighting. The other day, my young colleague  the 22 year-old Italian guy with curly hair I mentioned a few weeks ago  took off his wire-rimmed glasses because he had something in his eye. He kept looking at the end of his finger, really close, and it was obvious that he couldn't focus any further. but what was great was the sight of his glasses in his hand: they must be -7, and they looked so strong, everything really tiny through them. You could even see the heavy curvature of the lenses at the back. The guy looked so vulnerable, and I was so turned on. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2004, 07:00</p><p>Semi-rimless? On a building site? I'd have thought it made more sense to wear something tougher at work and keep the semi-rimless for after work. But then, maybe he's trying to impress guys like you ::) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopeman</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2004, 10:48</p><p>A really fun sighting yesterday. In the Starbucks near my home, there is this young guy (late 20s) from a building site who comes in for coffee most morning. I think he is Polish. He has blond hair that he's just cut short, and high cheekbones. Blue eyes behind much stronger glasses than you usually see on a construction worker - I'd say -7: gold, semi-rimless, flat fronts, lots of minimisation.  </p><p> </p><p>So yesterday he was having coffee with his friends when he suddenly took his glasses off and started wiping them. It was sooo exciting - he looked around with those blue eyes but you just knew he couldn't see a thing. He held his specs close to check them, then put them back on, but lifted them up again to look at his finger nail with his bare eyes. I reckon he can see between four and six inches without glasses - he'd be pretty useless on the building site if he broke them! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2004, 08:25</p><p>Hi together </p><p> </p><p>Last evening I had a very nice sighthing. I go - since longtime - again with the small train from my village to the city and at 8.pm. in this train have a group of young Boy between 17 and 20 y.o. One of them very handsome because he wear glasses, this is the first I see while watching peoples. He was not only handsome about his glasses, a rectangular, darkbrown plasticframe with very strong minus, I guess about 8 to 10 dptr. and as I can see (I have my seat opposite from him)the lenses are high-index. He had blond hairs (I think original he have brown hairs)with many gel dressed to a nice fashion hairstyle. His brown eyes was small behind the lenses and allway he had a big smile on his face, so I can see, that he had also very nice tooths (or teehts) - you know what I mean. Also his cloths was very nice for looking, wide silvershining Jeans and a brown leatherjacket. He was about 18 y.o. A very nice sighting for me. I think I will go more often with the trains leaving the car in home. </p><p> </p><p>Many greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

Oh, this boy was so cute. He wear a small, black plastic frame (oval) and I think the lenses was about - 10 or more and I think also the lenses are plastic CR 39 or so, very thick with many rings. He look so good that I look at him also, if he not wear glasses. He was in blue jeans with a white shirt and a black motobikejacket and he wear a red baseball cap. I saw him also after leaving the lift a few times while shopping. This was a very nice sighting, he was so sexy. </p><p> </p><p>Many greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopeman</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2004, 02:59</p><p>Nice sighting yesterday. I was passing a donwtown barber's shop, and saw this cute Asian boy (maybe Indonesian?) in the window - high cheekbones, almond-shaped eyes. Anyway, the barber was giving him a smart spiky haircut, but the boy (aged 18, I guess) kinda started into space, not looking in the mirror because.... his strong minus specs were folded in front of them. Myopic guys look so sweet when they get their hair cut - they look sort of embarrassed because they can't see themselves in the mirror. When the guy's glasses went on, his eyes came to life. The specs were oval, gold, hi-index, I would guess -6. Such a sexy sight. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2004, 06:18</p><p>Hi together, I'am back after more than 1 year. I read all weeks the postings here by eyscene, however I'am a little bit shy to post here about my english, because that's really not my language. However I'am also glad, that in guys in glasses have more postings again and I will post here some sightings with big hope, that the readers will understand my writing style. </p><p>I also stay together many years with my Thaifriend and he had in the last time big healthness-problems, so I not feel for posting something about my glassesfetish. We hope, that his sickness will turn to the good side for him. He wear now full time glasses with about + 1.00 for the far with a add. of + 1.50 for the near, because asian people are prespyop earlier than European or American peoples, he start to be presbyop with 34 years. </p><p>Next time I will post some sightings. </p><p> </p><p>Greetings to all from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

He can hide his blindness indoors,  moving around OK, but refuses to walk down the street w/o specs, says it would be dangerous, and always wears glasses swimming. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VisitBoy</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2004, 02:41</p><p>Myopeman: Yor colleague sounds very cute. A friend showed me how close he had to hold his mobile phone to read from it: upto about 12 inches and he's -4.00. </p><p> </p><p>I wondered how other guys get on with swimming and wearing glasses. There was a cute chap at my local pool who always wears his while he's swimming lengths. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, perhaps we can get the guys posting more sightings. I'm from the South-East of England, by the way. Where are you?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopeman</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2004, 15:26</p><p>I do chat to some of them! I have this colleague, 22 years old, I guess Italian origin, dark curly hair, little goatee beard, big brown eyes behind little wire specs that make them smaller. We were in Barnes &amp; Noble the other week and he took off his specs and showed me how close he had to hold the newspaper - like 4 inches from his nose. Woah! He says he's -7, but the lenses are thin as anything; awesome cut-in, though. I was just opposite him across the table and he said he couldn't even see my face. He goes swimming in the ocean but keeps his glasses strapped on because otherwise he can't find his friends on the beach!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VisitBoy</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2004, 14:28</p><p>Welcome Myopeman. Keep those stories/sightings coming. Don't ya just want to find a way to get chatting with some of those cute guys?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopeman</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2004, 11:24</p><p>I meant to add that I have a theory about this boy. He was really struggling to see, so why did he keep his specs in his pocket? Perhaps he was a contact user who couldn't wear them that morning, but was determined not to be seen in specs except where strictly necessary - ie, reading the train announcements. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopeman</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2004, 07:13</p><p>Hey, I'm fairly new to this site. Been checking out the archives and see that there was a time when gay guys posted fun sightings/stories all the time. What happened? Where are you all? </p><p> </p><p>Let me start the ball rolling again, I hope. Yesterday I was on a crowded train when a cute, slim Indian guy got on. Early 20s, spiky black hair, high cheekbones - sooo pretty. He stepped onto the train and I saw he was wearing rectangular black wire glasses, with power rings, maybe -3. But within seconds he had taken them off and stuffed them in his pocket, and he spent the next five minutes looking around him - not squinting but frowning, making it so obvious he couldn't see. His eyes were a hazel color, lighter than I expected. When I got off the train (reluctantly) I stood on the platform and looked right at him. His eyes were pointing in my direction but I knew my face was just a blur. What a cutie! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VisitBoy</b>&nbsp;21 Oct 2004, 13:04</p><p>A lovely sighting on the journey home tonight: Tall guy in his 20s, casual attire, short neat hair with long sideburns, a couple of rings on his fingers and a ring in his left ear. Needless to say, cute small rounded-oblong wire frames. Gorgeous! </p><p> </p><p>Boy, did I hope to make eye contact!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hi Queer Guy</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2004, 21:48</p><p>I watched QE and was just on their website.  Straight guy must have really bad eyesight.  Those nutrients are called Luteins and here is what Kyan said about them: "Take luteins for example, which are very important for anyone that has bad eyesight because they help with your vision."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Queer Guy for Queer Eye</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2004, 18:40</p><p>Did anybody watch Queer Eye For The Straight Guy tonight?  Tonights straight guy, John, wore glasses with a prescription of about minus 7.  Lots of glasses references and removals.  I cant wait to watch it again.  I think that each of the fab five guys touched, held, or removed, his glasses during the hour. </p><p> </p><p>While dressing him, Jai selects some sunglasses and holds Johns glasses and places them in his own shirt pocket.  When they arrive at the newly decorated house, Carson removes and holds Johns glasses.  When Kyan is educating John on vitamins, he mentions that a particular one is good for vision.  He then touches Johns glasses and comments on them being big and thick.  Later, after John gets dressed, he is presented with a new pair of glasses, courtesy of Lenscrafters.  I cant remember who, but I think it was Ted that placed the new ones on his face, while Carson removed and held the others.  Carson seems to like holding straight guys glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately nobody commented on the new glasses again in the show.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2004, 08:56</p><p>How weird. Still, be careful, I know these things exist - a trojan or a worm, one of our techies here can explain which, and once it infects your system it goes through your address book collecting e-mails addresses, then it sends people in your address book random messages that show other people from the address book as the sender. It also sends a copy of itself along, and so on. I don't THINK it harms your system other than that, just clogs up the bandwidth everywhere and drives everyone nuts. You really have to wonder at the mental state of someone who creates a thing like that.</p><p></p><hr>

I'd like to do a proper survey actually, and I'm working on that. I decided to offer my time to the cause because I can. I tried to find a website like mine and when there wasn't one, I made one, thinking "if I build it they will come" and here's the statistics: 31,000 total page views, 7,000 visits to the index page. Of course my site is also popular with gay men, so they are some of the numbers, but that's fine too, there was nothing like this for them either. It makes me very happy to be able to provide this resource, and I'm so grateful to those who send me contributions, be it stories, links, photos, or just suggestions and feedback.

<p><b>Eddy</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2004, 13:23</p><p>Jules, your comment on the realtionship between thought and action puts me in mind of the state of mystification which always overtakes me when I read press comments on "gay" Catholic priests. I mean, if the person in question is celibate, what's the difference between a "gay" priest and a "straight" priest. Presumably the nature of the temptation, not necessarily the sin. The implication, of course, is that the former sin is much greater than the latter. Not sure that infinite wisdom and mercy goes down those tracks. </p><p>With that I will cease and desist because a) I don't belong here and b) the theological bit's starting to get up my nose.</p><p></p><hr>

All people have a free will to choose which path they take in life, and will either reap the rewards, or the punishment, depending on which path they choose.Which path will you choose?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2004, 20:34</p><p>I'd expect that Christians would at least master "thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" before admonishing people on the other little bits.

<p><b>Kix</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2004, 17:13</p><p>Several of the guys I work with play basketball at a nearby gym including Jay, who normally wears glasses. He is somewhat attractive looking, tall and athletic with short brown hair, however he's a bit pompous and elitest so he's not someone I am necessarily attracted to. I had seen them playing a few times and noticed he wasn't wearing glasses so I assumed he wore contacts sometimes. The other day I stopped in to watch a bit of the game with another co-worker and saw Jay squinting every time he took a shot-I guess he plays bare-eyed. After the game I heard him telling someone he was surprised he had made so many of his shots as he couldn't even see the rim without his glasses. He's a lowish myope, maybe -2? In any case, I may have to stop in to watch these games more often. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2004, 05:40</p><p>Eustace- </p><p> </p><p>I started sleeping in my glasses when I was a teen and would spend the night at a friend's house. I was pretty myopic then and was afraid I wouldn't be able to find my glasses if I had to get up during the night. I continued at home and it just became natural. I just wear normal glasses although I do have a pair with cable temples. At times I have knocked them off during the night which means in the morning I have to feel around for them. It is both a turn-on and necessity. I hate being uncorrected for even a second.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2004, 04:22</p><p> </p><p>Dear -14: </p><p> </p><p>You actually sleep all night with your glasses (not contacts?)on?  That's fascinating!  Don't they sometimes fall off your face during the night when you change sleeping positions?  (Perhaps you have cable ear pieces or wear a "glasses guard.") Do you wear your glasses all night because it's a "turn on" or because you just don't want to wake up to a blur?  I once had a roommate in college who would often fall asleep with his glasses on. And, once or twice he just announced "I'm going to wear my glasses all night."  I was intrigued by this, but I never asked him why.  Now I wonder.  (Perhaps he thought that I might move over to his bed and try to do something!)  He was pretty nearsighted, but not that nearsighted. Curious!</p><p></p><hr>

I take them off to shave and then put them on to check for any missing hairs I missed. I'm nearsighted. I take them off when showering or bathing. With glasses, I took them off for sex, but it's been a while, a long time since I have had sex. If I was wearing contacts I doubt I'd take them off for sex.

I've just been too busy both at work and at home. </p><p> </p><p>I would like to post a little survey--just to find out if some of you share some of my particular (peculiar?) interests--and maybe to stimulate some responses and interaction from posters: </p><p> </p><p>Please answer the following questions about yourself: </p><p> </p><p>Do you . . . </p><p> </p><p>1.  Wear your glasses when swimming?  (If so, do you wear a "glasses guard" to keep your glasses from falling off in the water?) While shaving? While showering or bathing?  While kissing and making out?  While having sex?  (Regardless of the style and position?)  While getting a haircut? </p><p> </p><p>2.  Take your glasses off after you get in the bed at night?  Take your glasses off before or after you turn out the light?  Put your glasses on if you have to get out of bed and go the bathroom at night--whether you turn a light on or not?  </p><p> </p><p>3.  Leave your glasses on when you pull off a t-shirt or pull-over sweater. </p><p> </p><p>4.  Do you like glasses with cables that wrap snugly and securely around your ears? </p><p> </p><p>My answer to all of the questions would be in the affirmative--except for leaving my glasses on when getting a haircut.  (But I keep putting them on and taking them off to make sure the barber is trimming my hair the way I want.)   </p><p> </p><p>Now, go back through the questions and answer whether or not you are turned on by seeing another guy--or being with another guy--who is almost never without his glasses on his nose. </p><p> </p><p>My answer to these would also be a resounding "yes."  I am so turned on by guys with thick glasses who are almost never seen without them.  (And bifocals and trifocals are a plus!) </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2004, 08:34</p><p>Curt, I agree 100%. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2004, 08:34</p><p>You've only got to look at the "Hot or Not?" site to see how tastes can vary from your own. I've seen men on there get an 8 when they look like the "before" picture on a plastic surgery commercial. Maybe it's just the person who posted the photo voting over and over. Also, let's not forget that attractive may not mean "beautiful" to a fetishist, it may mean "really interesting, fascinating". That doesn't make it wrong, it just means that for someone who does mean "attractive in a standard, classical, mainstream way - OR ALMOST SO", the idea of that person being attractive is extremely puzzling. It's not JUST a matter of taste, but of basic definition...am I making any sense here at all? Think of the teenagers who find having a face full of staples attractive. If I was asked to choose between one multi-pierced face and another I'd have a hard time getting past the hardware (they just look like zits to me, sorry) and yet to a person who doesn't understand OUR fetish it's probably all the same thing! I bet it would be easy to find a person who is into faces unencumbered by anything. Maybe even hair. I think I'm rambling now so I'll shut up, but I hope this topic takes off!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2004, 08:32</p><p>Electra: I will post this here, but I think it is equally true of both men and women.   </p><p> </p><p>Glasses do not automatically make someone attractive.  But glasses can make a reasonably attractive person more attractive.  I think that is why some people (myself included) have such a fascination with celebrities wearing specs.  Most of us have seen these folks at their glamorous best; but to see them wearing glasses always seems like an added treat.  And when the glasses look really good on them, well...bonus!! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra (the real one, LOL!)</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2004, 08:24</p><p>Not a problem, these things happen. Spontaneity. </p><p>Yes, of course tastes vary (thank God, or we'd all be going after the same person). But I'm certain, well almost, that for many people here there's an extra dimension that transends normal physical beauty. Heck, how do I explain this. I've seen some pictures linked here that are so obviously not attractive. Like, OK, is Drew Carey attractive? Let's say he is "minority interest". Compare to say Brad Pitt. Because tastes change you can find people who think Drew Carey Is attractive, and you can find people who think Brad Pitt isn't, OK? But if there was a contest based on looks alone, not talent, not persomnality, not intelligence, just pin-up status, who would win the most votes?  </p><p> </p><p>Easy answer! Pitt! </p><p> </p><p>Ah.....But we are fetishists, right? So we will give extra points to those in glasses. Here's the difference. Drew Carey might get SOME exta points for his looks from glasses fetishists just because he's in glasses. OK. But Brad Pitt won't get any less, AND he'll still get more points from NON-glasses-fetishists, and will always win.  </p><p> </p><p>Then, if you ONLY allowed votes from glasses-fetishists, Brad Pitt is still going to win.  </p><p> </p><p>I'm sure it wouldn't be hard to find individual fetishists who prefers Drew Carey in glasses to Brad Pitt without, but chances are that if you put them side by side in glasses, and put it to a vote, Pitt would win. There really is such a thing as a standard in human atttractiveness, don't you think? </p><p> </p><p>I've got more thoughts, but not sure how many words that was.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2004, 07:41</p><p>The problem may be that different people have different ideas of what's attractive.  I find that, of the links to "attractive", "sexy", or "beautiful" women posted here, roughly one in ten pictures was even worth the time to look at it.  Of that 10%, maybe one in ten is really hot, to my eyes. </p><p> </p><p>I often come close to asking people to think before they post these links, but then someone will post a comment on one of the pictures I thought was hideous, or at the very least hopelessly frumpy, and comment on how wonderful that particular woman is. </p><p> </p><p>Takes all kinds I guess.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kix</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2004, 16:56</p><p>For several months I enjoyed regular sightings of a super-hot Guy With Glasses. Tall, lean but muscular, light brown hair with blonde tips (they had grown out the last time I saw him though), tawny skin from time spent in the sun and a straight white smile, he wore brushed silver wire rims, somewhere between rectangles and ovals. I would guess his Rx to be lowish minus, maybe -2. Enough of an Rx that there were some cut-ins. A few times I saw him in contacts but he obviously wasn't a fan, he never wore them for more than a couple hours, blinked constantly and never seemed to be without eyedrops. Definitely a hot one.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David_Llewellyn</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2003, 17:28</p><p>FourYeux: If you've been wearing high-index full-frame lenses, you might want to check out myodiscs, but you might find them difficult to get used to. One main advantage of them is, esp. in a "low" Rx like yours (!) (for myodiscs!) is that in a myodisc it can be done in CR-39 which definitely has superior optics, and yet not be any thicker than a high-index lens. You should definitely use as circular a frame as possible. This would in general be true for a high power, but any kind of lenticular lens which usually employs a circular bowl will look better in as round a frame as possible. If you must have rectangles I don't recommend myodiscs as the bowls will look kind of funny cut off vertically but with carrier showing on the side. WIth an odd-shaped frame you can have a pseudo-myodisc (my term) made by just having a lot of rolling done in the wider parts of the frame, where the lens is thickest.  </p><p>I don't think your vision will be any worse with myos than with full-frame lenses. Myos for your power use a 40mm bowl which is reasonably wide. You will definitely notice the bowl, a circle floating in front of your eyes, however. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2003, 10:34</p><p>FourYeux, thanks for your Rx response.  To start with a minus 6 must have made quite a difference in what you had been seeing, or not seeing! I am a minus 6 now and without my glasses everything is mostly a big blur.  When you got those first glasses I bet there was no problem with getting you to wear them all the time.  Regarding the myos, I see posts here about them.  Perhaps those posting can help you locate the information you are seeking.  Are you considering them because your glasses are becoming too thick or do you like the look?  With small frames and hi index what is the thickness?  Will have to look back in posts to check your Rx.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2003, 13:35</p><p>Kevin, </p><p>You could do GOC, which is discussed in another EyeScene thread.  You get contact lenses to alter your vision and glasses to correct that alteration.  You could get a doctor to prescribe this (be honest why you want the combo, and some doctors will oblige--mine did,) or you could go to a doctor for colored contacts with no prescription to get the proper measurements you need for contacts, then you simply order contacts from an online retailer in any power you want.  After that, order a corresponding glasses prescription.  Others here can explain in more detail how to figure what you need.  But first--have you had an eye exam recently?  You might need glasses and not realize it.  Or, if you go to a doctor who also sells glasses, it is possible that you will be prescribed a mild prescription just to make a sale.  Good luck!!</p><p></p><hr>

I know, that many of us only like myopics, however I'am in the comfort situation that I like both types of lenses. </p><p> </p><p>About 4 years before I saw near the river a asian Boy with plusglasses, in this time he was about 14 years old and I thinked, he must be really cute in a few years. And I saw him again, a young asian man, yet about 18 or 19 years old and I can remember the face of him. He is big (about 180 cm) with a very good sporting Body and short hairs dressed with gel. He was in shorts and T-shirts and of course he not stop wearing his glasses. The glasses are in a old style, big, brown and in plastic and about + 4 sph. lenses. With this old style glasses he look really very sexy and I think he like wearing glasses too. </p><p>I hope to not see him often, because I'am very exiting for a longtime. </p><p> </p><p>Greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

Just today at the gas station saw a hunky/stocky guy with short blond hair, in his early 30s, pumping gas into his Land Rover.  He was looking good in a pair of very necessary, very stylish rectangular plastic rim glasses, black and gray in color, with high index lenses around the -8 level.   I tried to catch his nearsighted gaze, but wasn't too successful.   </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, an online friend told me that he saw Ryan Seacrest (the host of the American Idol TV show) in glasses that seemed pretty strong minus.

It's pretty hard for me to get around without contacts, since my vision goes into total blur when I'm bare-eyed. Even though he gave the best Rx he could, I'm getting just a partial correction, since I have slight keratoconus in both eyes and it's very hard to fit me with contacts... anyway, I just want to have the best vision I can get.  </p><p>Talk to you guys later </p><p>C-ya </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>newguy</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2003, 04:17</p><p>hi guys, I've been following ES for quite some time, but have not really posted. Just a short intro about myself. I am a 28 year old asian guy from singapore and is a closet gay with a strong fetish for guys in thick glasses. In fact, I have been experimenting with GOC and owns a pair of -16 and -25 glasses which corresponds with +10 and +20 contacts respectively. I am about -3 myopic. </p><p> </p><p>The reason for posting today is that i will be at London alone at the end of July. I would like very much to meet up with guys who wears thick glasses hopefully above the -10 (or even better -20) range who can bring me around London, or whom i can stay with. </p><p> </p><p>I am not sure if I will receive any response from this mail, but I will certainly look forward to walking down the streets of London(an unfamiliar place), without any familiar faces, wearing my thick, thick glasses. It will be a feeling that I have always fantasised about and would love to experience. hope someone out there will share my sentiments and would contact me. </p><p> </p><p>My email is myo_pic@hotmail.com. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p><p></p><hr>

Oval wire rims and pretty thick lenses -- he looked great.  They were getting ready to go out for dinner, and he went to put his contacts in, so I saw him that way too. Very handsome, but of course for me it was all about his coke bottles.  I think his RX might have been around -6 or -7. </p><p> </p><p>Then later, I was at the market, and saw a small build Asian guy, wearing rimless glasses that were VERY thick. I think his RX was at least -10. It's about the strongest I've seen in a rimless.  Amazing!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2003, 20:25</p><p>How is everyone? Hope all is well. We've had various pride events here in Philadelphia, PA so I have seen many guys who I'd not normally see out and about. I saw many guys with the rimless frames, most with relatively light prescriptions and nearsighted it would appear. I went on a date with a guy who is unsure why he wears glasses. He lives many hours from me, so I'll see how it goes. He's cute. I asked him why he wears his glasses and he says it helps although he doesn't need them to see. He claims that he can tell he's straining his eyes if he doesn't wear them. I thought they might be for astigmatism.  </p><p> </p><p>I'd love to talk to any of you guys out there. Email me if you want.  </p><p> </p><p>David </p><p>DNBursky@aol.com</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BoBo</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2003, 18:23</p><p>I posted this in the signtings section, but probably should be here instead. </p><p> </p><p>I've seen a guy at a local bar in San Francisco (Mira Loma on Portola near Twin Peaks) with amazingly strong plus lenses. He seems to have two pairs, one plastic frames with hugely thick plus lenses, and another pair he sometimes wears with the bubble type of lenses, which are almost as thick but appear to be stronger. I'm not into guys, but he is not bad looking, trim and athletic, and in his thirties. I don't know the Rx, but I'm guessing it's in the teens at least. I've never seen such strong plus lenses. The other night the cute red-head bartender, who seems to really like him, asked to try them on. He also has a real problem keeping them up on his nose, especially the plastic frame glasses. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Wouldn't it be great if Travis Fimmel wore high minus lenses! </p><p>(Perhaps he does but never let's anyone photograph him in glasses.) </p><p>I'm only a -3; but I consider myself blind as a bat without my glasses (trifocals).  In fact, I had an appointment with my very cute opthamologist (who could pass for a junior in college) this morning.  He had given me a prescription a couple of months ago that was totally wrong for me:  I had to bring reading material within about 10" to see it; and I had to get uncomfortably close to my computer screen to see clearly through my mid-range lenses.  Hopefully the Rx he gave me today will correct all this. </p><p> </p><p>eustace</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;28 May 2003, 22:32</p><p>Hi Eustace. Yes, I am a -8, which I think some people at least would consider high minus.  And I use the name "tinyeyes" because I like the way high minus glasses make a guy's eyes look small.  I'm kind of tired of the name, but I've been using it a long time.  As far as gyms go, it's just a part of my life, and it is a good place to see good looking guys, both with glasses and without, in a relatively healthy setting.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eustace</b>&nbsp;28 May 2003, 20:23</p><p>tinyeyes:  Great sighting!  It was certainly a turn-on to me.  Perhaps I should start going to a gym.  Why do you sign yourself "tinyeyes"?  Are you a high minus?  How high? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;23 May 2003, 23:36</p><p>No one's posted here in weeks! Well, I was at the gym the other day, and I walked into the locker room, and I saw a cute guy, around 30, short brown hair, caucasian. I turned the corner and saw him just as he took off a pair of stylish tortoise rim glasses that seemed to be quite strong minus.  But alas, he took them off and started putting in his contacts, before his workout.  Five minutes later, I was out in the gym beginning his workout and saw him again. He was with a workout buddy, also a good looking young guy.  The funny thing is, he almost immediately began having problems with his contacts and couldn't even begin exercising.  I felt for him as I saw him wincing, then running over to the mirror.  He tried and tried to get that contact to stop bothering him, and finally he excused himself from the friend and went back into the locker room.  I was trying to concentrate on my workout, but couldn't help but notice that he was gone for quite a while. When he finally returned, you guessed it, he was back in his cute glasses again!  He looked really great in them, and obviously was much more comfortable, as they proceeded with their workout without further interruptions. This guy was probably about a -6 or -7.  To me, the entire incident was a huge turnon!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>fracl</b>&nbsp;29 Apr 2003, 17:44</p><p>The calendar thing starts making sense. I just don't know, where the fuck I should get it from. I'm in the UK right now and don't think they sell it here. I have a look in Paris on Friday, maybe I'm lucky there. </p><p> </p><p>I've been invited by my university to take part in a fun day out last Friday. We went to Alton Towers quite a big theme park in the UK. People were allought to bring there boyfriends, husbands etc. One of my femal costudents brought here boyfriend. Bloody Hell, he was 25 but looked more like 20, very nice, friendy with an upperclass accent. He was wearing glasses about -8 I would say, with lots of cylinder. In the coach I was sitting next to him but so that the corridor was between us and looking through his glasses it look like the road would go up in the sky because of the cylinder. People in the park were really small but quite tall trough his glasses and his puplis looked oval instead of round. His glasses looked very expensive and were only a week old, but he never took them off for the rides. He said he would not be able to enjoy them without glasses as he would only see correctly for about as far as 5cm. In the coach back home everybody was sleeping except the driver and me. He was sleeping as well and took his glasses of, time for me to put them one for a second, I was very afraid he could notice. But it was worth the risk. The cylinder made everything very tall and the -8 made the cars look like toys. Nice day, the park and the guy, said he has a girlfriend.</p><p></p><hr>

The point is, "Mr May" looks great - suggest you buy a copy when it comes out.</p><p></p><hr>

I've been a member of that club for a while now and you have to explain what a priest is doing on a calendar. :-) </p><p> </p><p>By the way I've taken part in the Eastern Evening prayer at Westmister Cathedral (the big roman catholic cathedral not Westmister abbay with big ben etc., I could never be member of a church where the queen is head of it) They had an impressif number of priests present (at least 20 plus Mgr and Bishop) one of them was quite young (about 20 to 25) and was wearing lovely black plastic frames with about -3 or more.

<p><b>fracl</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2003, 17:52</p><p>Hi all of you, </p><p> </p><p>I've been traveling a bit so I couldn't post for a while. I have some very nice stories to tell but I will not tell them all today but spread them out over the next week to keep things short. </p><p> </p><p>First, I have to talk about a sighting that I has about a year and a half ago. I was working as a barman in an English Pub in Luxembourg city over the summer, I was 19 or so, and out bouncer left us, me being the only one tall enough to so the job I found my self standing in the door on the weekend to check ID card etc. One night two guys wanted to get into the pub both seemed quite young, one a low minus guy the other one, one of the strongest plus I've ever seen with blond hair and blue eyes. Of cause I asked for ID and the low plus was 18 so no problem with him (I was not interested looking at him anyway), but the strong plus didn't have and ID card on him, great for me as I could spend some more time. I asked him whether he would have anything else for example a driving license to prove his age. He replied he would not have one. Well I asked for a public transport pass and he didn't show me the normal one but the one that disable people have (which doesn't show the Date of Birth) I asked him why he would have a normal one, and he replied that he would only see about 10% so he could not drive and would get the train and bus for free. Uuups, I was a bit shocked. Whatever he was looking cute in his very strong glasses, although one of his eyes was half closed all the time and didn't had the nice blue color but was more like gray. I let him in although he confessed being only 17 (still inside the legal age to drink, so it was fine). They sad down next to the door, I watched him all the time and I was sure he couldn't see me. After a first beer, he wanted to order a second one while his friend was inside the WC, he must have spotted my presence or heard me and asked me if we would serve at the tables. I replied now, and he asked me to show him where the bar was. I was very disappointed, as this pub has a huge bar that was only about 3 meters away from the table he was sitting. So I got him his beers, and he took out some coins. It took time ages to recognize the coins. When he was lighting a cigarette he needed both hands, one to use the lighter the other one to fell where the end of cigarette was. I had a little chat with him and he told me he would have never seen more, but that his vision did not get any worse over time, and that he would be happy to see those 10% instead of nothing without his huge glasses. I found some pictures of him on the Internet a while ago and printed them out, I had to scan them again as I lost the file. I posted them on: <a href="http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/guysglasses/vwp?.dir=/fracl1&amp;.src=gr&amp;.dnm=123.jpg&amp;.view=t&amp;.done=http%3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/guysglasses/lst%3f%26.dir=/fracl1%26.src=gr%26.view=t" target="_blank">http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/guysglasses/vwp?.dir=/fracl1&amp;.src=gr&amp;.dnm=123.jpg&amp;.view=t&amp;.done=http%3a//photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/guysglasses/lst%3f%26.dir=/fracl1%26.src=gr%26.view=t</a> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

I like also a lot Boys with pluslenses, myself I wear also (only about + 3.5 bothside with prismen add. 4 pdpt. base out. However I like to wear GOC with pluslenses from + 8 to + 12, for me it's a great turn on. My favourite is a + 10 (thick plasticlenses) with a add of + 2.00 (bifocal) aviatore style with sporting earpeace. When I go somewhere with this glasses I hear also comments like: Oh, my god, you see this thick or strong glasses and a Boy (mabe 10 y.o.) with weak plusglasses say to the mama: You think I must also wear strong glasses same the man. </p><p>In a few mounth I am able to post here the photos of this glasses.

I love wearing thick glasses, and it's nice that there's a group of us that can talk like this. </p><p> </p><p>I like to wonder what other people are thinking sometimes, outside of here.  Like, a few months ago, I was in line at a convenience store, and there were two guys behind me, and I heard one say something about "Look how thick his glasses are!!  Everything's upside down!!"  Obviously, they must have thought I was blind AND deaf... </p><p> </p><p>After I paid for my stuff, I just turned around to walk out, smiled at them, and pushed my glasses up (they slide down my nose frequently because they're so thick and heavy), as if to say, "Thanks for noticing." :) </p><p> </p><p>At another place, there were two teenage girls behind be, and I just barely heard one say, "Look at the glasses!"  And the other one gasped in astonishment and said, "Oh my God!!" </p><p> </p><p>Once again, nice to be noticed :)</p><p></p><hr>

Maybe it's too personal, but you did go to hotornot.com and I wasn't sure who you were looking to attract, guys or gals, or both. I too am in Pennsylvania, what part? It would be nice to chat online. </p><p> </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fildar</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2003, 11:20</p><p>First off, I was just over there, and.... Who gave me a low rating?? :)  I'm at a 7.6 there right now.  Judging by some of the messages here, I'm sure some rated me a 10.  How about the rest of you??  C'mon, 'fess up!! :)  OK, I'm kidding.  It's not that all-important... Anyway... </p><p> </p><p>DLD -- I can see great with my glasses on, and I'm totally helpless without them.  (I'm sure that's about the answer you expected :) ) </p><p> </p><p>Tommy -- No bi-focals here.  Just the +10 all the way through. </p><p> </p><p>I have to go back for an exam and probably new prescription and frames soon.  I'm leaning toward these... </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://store2.yimg.com/I/thesightsite_1722_18701044" target="_blank">http://store2.yimg.com/I/thesightsite_1722_18701044</a> </p><p> </p><p>They're very similar to my current ones, which I like a lot ..they're very comfortable on my nose, even with these thick, heavy lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2003, 08:05</p><p>Fildar, a question about your glasses and a comment about a friend with a strong plus Rx. </p><p> </p><p>Could not tell from the photo if you have bifocals?  If so, would the Rx for the bifocal be another plus 2 or 3? </p><p> </p><p>A friend with what appears to be a stronger plus than yours, although I do not know his Rx.  He does not seem to want to engage in glasses talk.  I do know he has bifocals and have heard him mention that he sometimes uses a magnifier.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DLD</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2003, 07:29</p><p>Fildar, </p><p>How well can you see through those glasses? Or a better questions, how well (or poorly) can you see without them? Can you make it around your house in the morning without them?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;11 Apr 2003, 21:57</p><p>Hi together, I have a other nice story. </p><p> </p><p>My businesspartner who know, that I'am gay told me 2 weeks before, that a new handsome man work in the Pizzeria in our town and he that I go for look him. </p><p>2 days later I go eat there and take the place on the bar in front of the pizzabakery. There really was a handsome young Italianboy, middlezized with black, short hair and in the uniform from a Pizzabaker. He was very sympathic and ask me about my favourite pizza. I was surprised, that he wear glasses, because my businesspartner don't know, that I'am a glassesfetishist. The glasses was very nice on him and one of my favourites from my childhood. Upper part darkbrown and lower part white transparent in the style from about 30 years before, however more fashionable and of course new. He had weak pluslenses, I guess not more than 1 dpt. For me a very nice sighting and I think I will go eat more Pizza there, even is not the best in town. The next morning I told to my businesspartner, that I was in thepizzeria and he ask me, what I think about the Pizzabaker. I told him about the glasses and he answer me, that him not wear glasses, the same day we go there again on highnoon and really he not had his glasses. Yesterday I go there again and of new he wear glasses, however not the same. This time a black oval metalframe and I think the pluslenses was a little bit stronger. </p><p>I will go more to this place. </p><p> </p><p>Greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;09 Apr 2003, 22:47</p><p>Hi together </p><p> </p><p>Last evening after finished my work I went to the garage next to my opposite of my office for go take back my car after reparing. When I enter in the office from the garage for handling my keys there wait a young, handsome man talking with a serviceman. He was toll (mabe 185 cm) had long brown hair with a very nice styled ponytail. He wear black leatherjeans and a black motobikejacket and undet this hacket a pink T-Shirt ( I think he is gay also), when I look his style. And naturally he wear glasses, a nice oval brown plasticframe with strongish minuslenses (I guess both sides 5 to 6 dptr.) I wait about 5 minutes for my keys, so I had enough time for watching this nice young man. For me that was a very nice sighting. </p><p> </p><p>Greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2003, 14:46</p><p> </p><p>I guess I really didn't finish making my point: I just haven't gotten around to going to the optician with my new RX. </p><p>For one thing, I really like my longtime optician; but I want to make shure this time that I do not get-- what are they called--high-index lenses, and I don't know quite how to tell my optician this.  I suppose I can just claim economy, assuming that high-index are indeed more expensive. Are they?  And do opticians simply assume that everyone wants their lenses to be as thin as possible? </p><p> </p><p>As for the website in question, I particularly liked the photo with the caption "Ok, so no one wears there [sic] glasses in the shower but . . ." </p><p>Well, I  always do.  And the thought of this hunky guy wearing his glasses in the shower is quite a turn-on.  Actually, the photo is food for all sorts of fantasies, for example:  Imagine that the hunk (whom I have by now named Duncan) is actually a college student taking a shower in a communal dormitory situation.  Just before getting into the shower, he puts his very thick glasses (lets say at least minus 10)down on the edge of one of the several lavatories across from the showers. (I picture the frames as being round silver wire with cable-type temples.)  Being so very near-sighted, when he steps out of the shower he cannot find his glasses. But he can hear and blurringly and dimly see a guy standing at one of the urinals.  In a state of panic, he calls out to the other guy to help him find his glasses.  The new friend gladly does so and places the glasses on Duncan's face and gently affixes the cables behind his ears--and then he impetuously and pasionately kisses the nearsighted hunk---at first on the cheeks, forehead, and neck and then on the mouth.  Duncan responds.  Then one thing leads to another and, no one else being around, they duck into the shower and . . . .  Well, I could go on, but you get a sense of where I go with my fantasies of guys with glasses. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2003, 07:55</p><p>Hi together </p><p> </p><p>I have something nice for post here, it's 3 weeks ago, I have appointment with the 17 y.o. old son from my friend (him know that I'am gay) and for him I am same as a second papa and also a good friend. I know him since he was 9 years old. </p><p> </p><p>Today he is a very handsome young men (half european and half Thai), mediumsized, black short hair, brown eyes and most of time he had only black or white cloths (mixed together) what look very nice on him. </p><p> </p><p>O.K. in this late morning we seat in a open Café in the Railway Station drinking coffee and talking. Mabe 50 metres from there we stay is a Railwaystation-Clock (watch) and he ask me, if I can see good the time or not. I spook to him: yes shure, because I have glasses and my eyes are checked allready. After I ask him, if his eyey are also o.k. and he answer me: Oh, I don't know, sometimes I think, my eyes not so good. </p><p>I take this chance and propose him to go check his eyes to an optican, what he agree and so we went by car to a shop not so far from the railwaystation and we had good luck and must wait only 15 minutes for have a appointement to check his eyes. He was a little bit nervous, but myself I think I was more nervous than him. </p><p> </p><p>About 20 minutes later he come back from the small room (I wait outside) and he smile and told me, that he must wear glasses. My first tohght was: How strong etc. etc.however I take the time and 5 minutes later, when I see the prescription I know it. </p><p> </p><p>He was anisometropic, what will mean that the difference from 1 eye3 to the other is more big than usally. Left he had + 0.75 with some cylinder and right </p><p>- 1.25 (no cylinder) The optican propose him to wear contacts because the resultat will be better with lenses than with glasses. After a moment Pet (that is his name) say: No, I like more wearing glasses than contactlenses and the optican say to him: o.k. however maybe you will have troubles first with your glasses. </p><p> </p><p>After we go look for some frame and we find a very nice for him, a oval plastic frame in brown colour. The shop ma this glasses between 1 hour and finally a paid 420 CHF (about 280 USD) thinking, that the insurance will pay a part of this eyeglasses, however after 2 weeks the insurance write back and says that for a remboursement the first prescription must be issued by a eyedoctor, so the insurance pay nothing. </p><p> </p><p>Pet wear his glasses since 3 weeks all the time and it seems, he we very happy with them and me tooooooo. </p><p> </p><p>This a true story. </p><p> </p><p>Greetings from Singa </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2003, 04:20</p><p>Last evening, when I went to the Supermarket in my small town I had 2 very nice sightings. </p><p>After park my car I went to the elevator and touch allready the switch for the ground floor when I saw some people will come inside also, so I open again the door and outside was a very handsome Boy (mabe 18 y.o.) and he spook to me very friendly "thanks so much" and he smile. He was about 180 cm high with sandcolour cargojeans and a black wide skiing jacket. The hair brown, a little longish and glasses, oval brown frame with lenses - I don't know more minus or more plus, however a lot oc cylinder, never before I saw glasses with so much cylinders. On the lower part can see many cylindric power rings both sides and behind the glasses very nice brown eyes. I think, that he must know I like him about his glasses. When leaving the lift he says to me: By, by, have a nice evening. I was very nervous about him. </p><p> </p><p>After shopping I went to the cashier and in my row stand a lot people. When I turn me to the back side I saw behind me a young, good looking asian (I guess 18-20 y.o.) with Bluejeans and blue Jeansjacket and with a black basketball </p><p>cap. He wear (for asiam people not so usually) medium strong plusglasses (I like plusglasses also on young mens) mabe 3.5 to 4 sph. and I think no cylinder. I can watch him for a while, because I spood to him, that he can go before me to the cashier, he had only 1 item top pay, so I can watch him better from behind. Looking this handsome asianboy I forgot quickly the first sighting. I hope you can understand my bad english. </p><p> </p><p>Greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2003, 21:57</p><p>To answer your question, the guy I saw at the supermarket whizzed in and out so fast I barely got a chance to get a good look at him, much less speak to him.  I don't normally walk up to strangers and ask about their glasses!  I do have another sighting to report, though. This week I am at a new work assignment which places me right across from a rather cute, but nerdy, Amerasian guy in his late 20s, working at his computer all day, wearing oval wire rims with polished coke bottle lenses that are probably around -9 or -10.  Nice view....   his glasses slip down and he pushes them up all day, and looks very closely at things he's reading, but never once in two days have I seen him take the glasses off, even to clean them.   His glasses slip down so much that this bare eyes are almost always visible when I look over, although of course he only looks through his coke bottles -- his myopia is far too high for anything else.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2003, 00:26</p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>I am very happy for you at your love life excitement. I am curious, why didn't you ask the guy with the odd looking glasses at the supermarket where he purchased the glasses? </p><p> </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2003, 16:39</p><p>Hi there. I haven't posted much recently. I have had a smattering of nice sightings lately, including yesterday at the supermarket -- a very attractive Hollywoodish guy, probably straight, with a great looking unusual pair of glasses on. They were rectangular in shape, with plastic frames, but instead of being black or brown as that style so commonly is, they were clear frames....so the frames had the appearance of lens edges. Maybe the idea of the frames is to mimic rimless lenses, which would not have been recommended for this guy since his RX was around -8. The frames obscured his thickish lenses well, but it was easy for me to spot him as a tinyeyed high myope. Very nice.  </p><p> </p><p>Also, don't want to get too personal, but I've been dating a great new guy for about a month now.....he's 29, super attractive, about a -6 or -7 and lives in his contacts.  He does have backup glasses though and, while he thinks my fetish is a little odd, he has been willing to indulge it a little.  I've only heard one comment about getting lasik which I immediately spoke up against.   (His contacts bother him a lot.)  I'm really enjoying getting to know this guy -- for good or bad, high myopia is pretty much a requirement for me to get interested in someone, and this guy has that plus so much more to offer.  That's it for now. (For those who are wondering, I'm a 35 yer old gay guy.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2003, 16:51</p><p>Fracl, thanks will check the sites, had a busy day selecting new rimless glasses, first for me, always thought they would be too thick with my -6 Rx but have now found out with my +2 sph. my Rx is only a -4.  Do I have it right is it sph. or axis?  Tommy</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>fracl</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2003, 13:38</p><p>to Tommy </p><p> </p><p>Yes I am male :-) and the guy who posted pictures a while ago on Yahoo Groups and here. Yes, I know what RX means, but I can't give you all the RXs of all the guys on the pictures, because I don't know their RX and usually don't even know the guys. They are just pictures from the internet. I can tell you that the blond guy with the blue oakley's glasses is as far as I remember -2.75 l and -3.00 r but can't confirm as it's been ages since I asked him. Most picures are already in their best quality I just cut the faces out. If you want to see more of the guy in the blue oakley and maybe even find some other guys in glasses check www.luxembourgbynight.com and select either Alex or Loll under "Reporter" and you will some get pictures of Alex (guy with the blue oakleys). Check www.alex.lu or www.party.lu for more picure galleries</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2003, 13:23</p><p>fracl, yes, that's pretty much it.  A slightly long sighted person can focus in the distance and see OK, but it can be a strain.  When I first got my glasses I had to wear them for closework, but if I was tired there were times when it was a real strain to see in the distance so I would wear my glasses to help me see.  However, in my experience once you wear + glasses for any length of time your eyes relax and so it becomes much harder to do without them.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2003, 12:59</p><p>fracl, are you the person, male I think, who posted the nice photos of the guys in glasses?  I liked the close up views and your comment about the strength of the glasses.

<p><b>fracl</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2003, 12:26</p><p>Farsighted guys in strong plus glasses are very nice to look at and plus glasses have their attraction. It's just that as the person that is not wearing the glasses you only get a nice and interesting view when you face the person, which can be embarrassing. You don't see anything through strong plus glasses and to see how the glasses make the face bigger on the side of the eyes you have to look straight into the persons eyes. While if you spot a nearsighted guy you can still look through the glasses from the back and see the power rings form the side etc. without have to look into the persons eye all the time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>fracl</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2003, 12:19</p><p>Mmmh, I'm confused. I think I will never understand how this farsightness works. Am I right in my assumption that when a person with perfect vision puts on minus glasses he sees like somebody that is farsighted without his glasses. If I put on let's say glasses that are by -4 stronger then my RX I should see like someone with +4. But I'm able to focus till I see everything clear at least for a short time. Can a farsighted person also focus for a short time and see normal when he's not wearing glasses. And why is it called farsighted when I can see nothing with -4 witout focusing no matter how FAR away it is. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eustace</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2003, 20:17</p><p>I'm confused.  Doesn't farsighted mean that one needs glasses only for reading and other close-up work?  Why would someone who is farsighted wear his glasses all the time? Eustace </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2003, 18:55</p><p>Not much to really say about the guy, as it was a bad night. He wore glasses all the time and even adjusted them back if they slipped just a bit.

<p><b>fracl</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2003, 10:53</p><p>I was visiting a well-known university a few days ago to do some research there. I was allowed in the student's union bar and went there the first night. I immediately spotted a cute young guy with extremely strong plus lenses. But ignored him soon after. Later I saw a person I knew from the department and he invited me to join him and sit with him and his friends. And you probably guest it, it was the table with the strong plus guy. I was sitting next to him and we had a chat. To get a conversation about glasses I used an old trick. As I was wearing contacts, I put some eye drops into my eyes and then he asked my what was wrong with them. I told him about dry contacts etc.etc. and I asked him whether he ever had contacts. he said no and told me his eyes would not support them anyway. I told him that I would find his glasses very strong for such a young person and asked his the RX. He didnt know how strong they were just said that they would be the about the strongest plus lenses you could get from a particular manufacturer. They were indeed very strong and I asked if I could try them on. He agreed. I looked the lenses they were very very thick, and caved outward on both sides. What a pleasure, I could see about 3cm far and then blurred like hell. I guess they were above +10 but I can't confirm. They were very small frames and his eyes were huge behind them. You could only see them when you were looking straight into his eyes. He was looking over them when he was looking when he was looking at me, as the music was very loud we had to out our faces just next to each other. He told me he could see a tiny bit of close things without glasses and that's why he would peel over them. A bit strange I though as he was farsighted. But I never understood how farsightness works.  </p><p> </p><p>After I had the glasses for about a minute they where requested by other people and they were going round and round. Everybody tried them on and they came back to me 3 or 4 times. We played with them and used them to magnify things and get huge eyes by pulling them away from the eyes. He did not request them back after a few seconds, as people with strong glasses usually do, but he just carries on drinking. He used both of his hands to search for his drink, he could recognize anything on the table. To challenge him I asked him to give me back some money he still owed me from the last drink. He had to hold the coins just next to his eyes. I looked to me like he would be well trained in being "blind". After about 5 minutes, I put his glasses on the table, just next to him. After a while he asked to have them back as he wanted to go to the toilets, I told him they would be just in front of him, he smiled and started searching for them with his fingers, slowly moving his fingers over the table top. He found them and put them on. He told me he would love taking them off sometimes and that he would like them because they would make his blue eyes look bigger and that he would never want lasik or contacts. What a nice night out. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2003, 02:36</p><p>fracl: </p><p>You were asking about people with one high plus and one high minus lens, and the answer is very few. I have a friend/colleague who wears glasses full time with a plus and a minus lens, but both fairly low; I posted on 'Julian's jottings' the other week about a sports massage therapist whose lenses are opposite but moderate; and I have a young friend who normally wears contacts, but when he does wear his glasses the right lens is strong plus, maybe with cylinder as well, and the left low minus. </p><p>The only real instance I can think of goes back to when I was 20 or so and had a spell in the ENT ward. In the bed opposite was a guy of about my age who obviously wasn't short of a bob or two and was about the second person I'd ever come across (as far as I knew) who wore contact lenses. How this came to be discussed I don't know, unless we had seen him with glasses and without. I know some of the older men in the ward said they thought it was a ridiculous expense  - remember I'm talking ancient history now - and he stuck out his chin and said as far as he was concerned they were worth the money. When he took them out the glasses he put on had one really strong minus lens and one not high but substantial plus. </p><p>The problem with wearing glasses like that is that one lens magnifies and the other minifies, and binocular vision is a problem, but I'm told that with *constant* wear the brain sorts out the difference in size between the images the two eyes send. With contacts this doesn't arise because there's no distance between the eye and the lens, but if you chop and change between contacts and specs you have to adapt every time. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>fracl</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2003, 19:08</p><p>tinyeyes </p><p> </p><p>I know lots of people that think that beeing bisexual would just be something you are saying because you are afraid of telling people that you're gay or that you just make the gay part up because your mum was a stronger person than your dad and that in reality your just straight etc, etc,. I heard lots of theories about it. I think that the "gay" part in me does not come from having it in my genes as it has been proven for about 50% of gay guys. When I think back to when I was a young boy, my two best friend in primary school both had glasses, one was strong minus the other one was weak plus, as far as I remember. The were always changing glasses for fun, and more than once I could try them on as well, I often wanted glasses as well. Later optics became my favoured part in Physics and I liked magifing glasses etc. I think that passion for lenses just became a sexual desire over time. When I was about 11 I first masurbated and I had a friend in my head who was a stong minus. Only a few years later I just devolopped more and more male hormons I guess and I started looking after girls and getting attracked by them. But the early sexual expieriences connected to boys and their glasses don't seem to have disapeared. Maybe that helps you to understand a bit more how I can love girls while still beeing attracted by glasses and in some sort also by the boys that wear them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2003, 22:00</p><p>Fracl, I'm gay but I think I understand your position. Sometimes it's hard for straight and gay people to understand being bisexual, and it's not easy for me, but I try.  I guess it's just how we're wired, and you're wired for both, eh?  My wiring is that I'm a guy, who loves guys, and even more if they wear glasses.  We're all different. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>fracl</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2003, 18:16</p><p>I found this website, it got good glasses stories and fantastic simulations of how people see with different kind of glasses.

I'm probably the stanges person if it comes to sexual attraction you can imagine. But it's good fun after you pass the stage where you're thinking there is something wrong with you and get to enjoy it and live with it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>fracl</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2003, 08:44</p><p>I was in London over the week-end with a fiend to visit his mum. When we entered Vigin Megastore on picadilly cirus, I imediatly spoted a very nice looking, tall, guy with high minus, about 20 years old. I could only see the left side of his face and I could see shining edges of thick glasses. As my friend is a DJ, we usally split up in record stores as he goes to the vinyl section while I look at CDs. I waited till my fiend left (he does not now that I like glasses) and I followed the guy, finding myself in the metal section (I don't like metal). But come the best part. I was in the same shelf row as he was and looked through his left glass, wow, about -7 to -8 I loved his glasses. I wanted to check how his glasses would be on the right and expected something a bit stonger or a bit weaker but I saw a very strong plus lense hard to guess but above +3 if not +4. I had to run on the other side of the shelf because I wanted to see him from the front. But when I arrived he already left for the DVD shelf on the other side of the store. And then he left the shop. Damm it. But I could spot him thought the window going into Burger King on the other side of the circus I went to my friend and told him I would go to Burger King to have a coke and told him to join me later, he agreed, uuuf. So I rushed into burger king and there he was at the till. Of cause I had wait at the same till as the guy so I could be right behind him and look at his glasses. Later I was sitting at the table in front of him and saw his face for the first time. The first guy I've ever seen with such a difference in precription between the left and the right eye. His right eye was all big and the left one tiny ass hell. Oh my god, I know its nasty but I allthought I prefer sex and living with girls would have left my girlfriend for this guy as nothing I've ever seen was so pretty and sexy ass those glasses on this perticular guy. I would have loved to look thought his glasses. I love minus and plus glasses and I he had both.  </p><p> </p><p>Does anyone knows people with high plus on one eye and high minus on the other?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2003, 06:44</p><p>Del Doc...what I said in the earlier posting was that when I asked for thicker edges, the salesperson suggested high index so the lenses would be lighter.  I was so glad that he agreed to make the edges thicker that I bought the high index lenses so as not to quash the deal.  I was afraid that if I didn't agree to the high index lenses, he would say, "I won't make the lenses thicker."  Even with the high index lenses, the edges are probably 7 or 8 millimeters thick.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DelDoc</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2003, 13:31</p><p>Russell-- </p><p> </p><p>Are you saying that the optician misled you into thinking that a high-index material would result in a thicker lens? Any optician should know that the exact opposite is true. As the index of refraction of the material increases, the thickness decreases.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2003, 09:49</p><p>Eustace...In my case, I agreed to the high index lenses because I was glad that the optician agreed to make the lenses thicker.  But I think in a lot of cases, you have to ask the optician exactly what lenses he is giving you.  Many of them will automatically give you the higher priced lenses with all the bells and whistles.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2003, 21:49</p><p>Hey Scott, </p><p> </p><p>Wow, that's an amazing prescription you've got there.

<p><b>eustace</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2003, 14:29</p><p> </p><p>Russell: </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for sharing your optician story.  Am I correct, then, that if you do not specifically tell the optician that you DO NOT want high-index lenses, then he/she will make you lenses "high-index" thin?  Are high-index lenses more expensive--or is it just the standard now? </p><p> </p><p>Eustace</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2003, 07:59</p><p>Eustace...here's my story aobut requesting thicker lenses.  The salesman at the chain store said that they could make my lenses thicker (I was only about -1.50.) He then suggested I get high index so they wouldn't be heavy.  An hour later, the glasses were made and not very thick at all.  Since I had paid a fortune, I complained and refused the glasses.  The optician then got angry, I guess, or he decided that I had been serious when I said I wanted thick lenses.  The second time, I got lenses that were quite thick.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MATTP</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2003, 06:57</p><p>Scott and Eustace-- </p><p>I also wear trifocals.  MY prescription is -4.75 with astigmatism, and my add is +2.50.  I'm 47, and first got bifocals in my early thirties to relieve eyestrain, but by my mid thirties I needed the bifocals to see to read.  I hated the bifocals and progressive lenses for years--there were always blind spots where things were fuzzy.  Then last year my optometrist suggested trifocals.  Why he didn't earlier is beyond me. The trifocals are wonderful!  All things at all distances are clear.  I wonder why they are not more common.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eustace</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2003, 20:17</p><p> </p><p>When I first became presbyopic I had those what-are-they-called "graduated lenses."  Then several years ago I switched to trifocals, which I find such an incredible turn-on--whether on me or on other guys.  Of course, I also find bifocals a turn-on on other guys--or just glasses for that matter (but the thicker the lenses the better). </p><p>Scott's getting bifocals and then trifocals at such an early age is a turn-on.  (But, of course, I've seen 3 and 4 year olds with bifocals.)  I'm still not very knowledgeable about prescriptions and lenses.  What are prism lenses, and when and for what are they prescribed?  My Rx is R -2.50 and L -2.50.  I guess that's not very strong compared with some; but I feel completely blind and helpless without my glasses.  I never take them off, except to sleep. I even wear my glasses when showering, when swimming, and when making love. My partner is very nearsighted as well; and I just love it when the two of us make love, both wearing glasses.  And a final question:  Does "high index" mean lenses that are made to look as thin as possible, given the Rx.  If that's what it means, I guess that I now have "high index" (which I assume is the standard unless you specifiy otherwise?)  For my next pair of glasses, I would really like to ask my optician to make mine as thick as possible.  However, I think my long-time optician would find this very peculiar. </p><p>Any advice on how to handle this?  (I do like my regular optician.) </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for any information or response from any of you. </p><p> </p><p>Eustace </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2003, 17:27</p><p>I have a nice sighting to report -- really it's more than a sighting.  It's a guy from the gym I frequent (where I seem to have many of my sightings). I first saw this guy in his glasses a few months ago (I'd seen him in contacts for some time before), and was so bowled over I went up and made small talk with him. I thought I posted that encounter on here, but I can't find where I did.  Here's the description: tall and slim, around 30, with a very nicely toned body, short dark curly hair, and generally dark good looks although not too tan -- to me he looks Jewish or possibly Italian, but I really don't know.  The first time I saw him in his glasses I went up to talk to him (as he worked out) and told him I liked his glasses. They were hard not to like as far as I'm concerned -- rectangular metal frames with thick coke bottle lenses and a very strong minus correction. He seemed surprised that I would say anything about his glasses and ended up telling me his RX: -8.5 and -9, and that he was blind.  I'm surprised he said that much, because he wasn't particularly friendly (and he never is,) although I did find out his name was Dan. </p><p> </p><p>I hadn't seen Dan in his glasses in a while, but suddenly twice this week I saw him bespectacled.  And I never get tired of looking at him when he has his glasses on.  He's just amazing.....I want so much to get to know him...I'm very attracted to him...but he ignores me (and pretty much everyone else) so much it seems hopeless. The bonus is, while he's ignoring me, I can look right at him and his amazing tiny eyes in those glasses and he doesn't even seem to notice.  Although a -9 prescription doesn't necessarily require thick lenses these days with high index available, he apparently didn't opt for high index, or at least for the highest offered, because the lenses are definitely thick and nerdy looking (and very sexy!) Lots of cut-in, distortion, and flash. </p><p> </p><p>Today Dan was there again and in his coke bottles, and I didn't even have time to look at him too much. But when I went to the locker room to get ready to leave, there he was at the sink, combing his hair, with no shirt on, and no glasses on! I stood near him, wondering how he could possibly see....then I saw his glasses folded on the counter....and then I noticed a contact lens case. Aha!...he had just put his contacts in, and so his thick glasses were suddenly completely unneccessary. I watched as he carefully put his glasses into a gray case.  Somehow all this was very exciting to me....although it would have been much better to witness the opposite....that is, seeing him take out his contacts and then grope to put his glasses on. </p><p> </p><p>Well, maybe someday I'll break Dan's shell...because he is defnitely a dream guy. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2003, 10:17</p><p>Went to a good party at a private club last night.A friend of mine has had new glasses. Black fashoinable small and narrow with relatively thin lenses but power rings still noticable. Left about minus three; right about minus six. </p><p> </p><p>I said how nice they looked and asked to try them on. I took them in to the toilet and had to look hard in the mirror to see myself. It made me think how good it would feel to do g.o.c. When I handed the glasses back the guy did not take hold of them and they fell on to a soft chair. I picked them up and gave them to him. I guess he couldn't see properly to take them off me. </p><p> </p><p>Later when a load of friends were dancing in relatively dim light (but still enough to see) another friends glasses fell on to the floor and onto the carpet. The glasses are about minus five and a half each eye. He got on his knees  and fumbled for them like Velma on Scooby Doo. He found them more or less straight away. I  would have loved it if he took longer! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>fracl</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2003, 17:40</p><p>It's a bit sad that Dom's groups don't exist anymore I was just about to add a 3rd group ('internet3) of good pictures and after sorting the good ones out I could not find the group anymore. There are so few people on the net that seem to be interessed in the fetish side of glasses and now we lost a main part off connection between us. I hope there will be new groups one day. </p><p> </p><p>I've been visiting my parents and some friends in my old home country Luxembourg over the week-end. I was going out in bars and clubs and I took part in the anti war demo on Saturday so I saw lots of young guys. Luxembourg seems to be the only place I've been to where about a third (belive me) of boys in glasses wear Oakley glasses as there normal clear precription glasses. I've not been there for about half a year and I come back and it's become such a fashion there. Even the young police man at the airport had some very nice Oaklay about -3 or -4 with blue glasses. Saddly I didn't have any metal objects on me so he didn't had to check me closly, I would have love him comming closer to me and using one of these hand metal detectors on my. I even saw some old friends that have been wearing contacts for a while and now wear Oakley glasses because it's cooler than contacts. Saddly here in England nearly nobody wears Oakley not even as non precription sunglasses, maybe you need a place with rich young guys that can affort Oakley precription like in wealthy Luxembourg. They cost a fortune especially if you get the original Oakley precription sun - or clear glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2003, 16:44</p><p>fracl.  Interesting story. Please do post more to this site.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2003, 15:56</p><p>Hmm, those are both good reasons. I didn't even know that it wasn't an adult site. I never thought about it, but for me, too, the appeal was guys wearing their glasses, not state of dress or whatever. I could live with it either way, but I hope it comes back!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2003, 15:05</p><p>Yes, I think it is about the porn pics that were included in the webpage, but I liked them, most of them are glasses related, and after all it is a gay site, isn't  it?  I think that in order to keep it working it should change its setting to an adult yahoo groups site.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2003, 13:39</p><p>Doesn't suprise me that the spexyguys disappeared. Once the porn pictures that weren't glasses related started appearing, it was only a matter of time before they removed it. Or maybe Dom removed it after someone linked an email to his web page. I miss the original concept of faces of guys in glasses but not what spexyguys had become.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2003, 12:50</p><p>Yeah, same thing here....the spexyguys group seems to be gone and it no longer shows up in my list of groups on Yahoo. Dom, what's up???</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2003, 21:32</p><p>Hi, I wanted to ask if the spexyguys group at yahoo is no longer available? I searched for it and came upon a horrible message that said that the group did not exist, does anyone know what happened?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>fracl</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2003, 20:36</p><p>Ok hello, I'd never thought I would ever post something on this site, but after getting so much pleasure reading all your stories I thought I would have to give something back. And anyway there is just a handfull of sites that deal with the sexuality around glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I'm 20 live in England although I'm Luxembourgish and will probabliy go back there in a couple of years. (England sucks if it comes to boy's glasses to many contacts and if they wear glasses they only do so because they can't affort contacts and then there glasses are old and dirty). I'm only R -1.25 L -0.75 a bid sad, I know. I hate it when people ask whether you acually have real prescription glasses or just wear them for fun, so I try to wear contacts when I go out. </p><p> </p><p>I'm the proud owner of a couple of other glasses then my own ones. First of course, 2 pairs of plus (+3.50)reading glasses you can buy at any supermarket, they are usually old fashioned but no hazel to get them. Then one pair of about -1.5 that I found in my old school and some about -3 that I stole in the shop of a holiday resort in Danemark. They have been found on the beach or so and somebody handed them in, they were lying next to the till for more then a week. Then I decided to steal them as obviously nobody wanted them back. Quite exciting to steal glasses from behind the till while the woman working there was cheating to a customer. </p><p> </p><p>As you probalbly know it is very hard to get glasses, especially minus without a precription, and I don't want to steal glasses of somebody's nose (although it would be fun for me seeing a -10 or so running after me). I have a friend who also gets sexual pleasure out of glasses and when he visted Russia one day he got the idea of buying glasses of the people. He bought back about 3 good strong minus glasses. He paid poor boys a good (for Russian standard, nothing for a European) amount of dollars and they gave him their glasses. The boys had enough money to get new ones and have lots of money left for other things. Good trade, in'it. </p><p> </p><p>I was lucky enough to finally find a site on the net that sells value glasses witout having to send your prescription on an offical document or giving your doctors telephone number. So I got myself some. They are L -4.00 and R -3.75 with some axis for that special extra fun. Well you are proably wondering what I'm doing with them, well I just like wearing strong glasses. My first expierience was a day out in London (nobody knows me there, so no risk) and all I was doing was walking about with these minus glasses. Good fun especially at Mc Donalds in Whitechaple East London (very busy and rough islamic and indien market area), it was hard to focus on the menu, on the saleswoman and then on the money in a short periode of time. </p><p> </p><p>I thought my eyes would go bad because of these glasses but it seems that nothing happens at all. Do you know what happens if you wear stronger minuses than you acually have for lets say an average of 1 hour per day? </p><p> </p><p>I'm not really gay and I don't get attracted by boy in general, but since I was about 10 I get this special excitment when I see guys with high minus or plus and can't stop looking at them. But strangly I don't like girls in glasses. Mmmh I don't know whats wrong with me but I'm happy to have found you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 Feb 2003, 00:59</p><p>Went to another gay bar in L.A. tonight, filled with lots of well-dressed, good looking young guys. There were a number with glasses. The standouts were:  </p><p>a late twenties or thirtyish dark haired white guy, cute with medium height and average but well toned build, wearing very stylish looking, black frame glasses that had a retro look. His Rx was about -4 or -5 and the glasses looked great -- they caught the light in such a way that I instantly knew his RX was stronger than average. The other standout was another white guy around 30 in age, tall and slim, with a full beard (another standout feature, but it looked great on him), and otherwise very preppy or conservative looking, sandy brownish short hair, cute face. He was also wearing black framed glasses, but his were small, extreme rectangles with almost square corners. His RX, too, was around -4 or -5 from what I could guess. This one I talked to and we had a nice little conversation, but then he went back to talking to his friends.  I never saw the 2 guys at the same time, but they would have been cute together and probably could have traded glasses and been able to see pretty well!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>poorsightboy</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2003, 11:53</p><p>Hello!i love the stories about the boys with thick glasses! but do you like movies with nearsighted guys if yes then please post some filmtitles so we all have fun seeing them!  greeetings from </p><p>the boy with poor sight!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2003, 23:32</p><p>You're probably right, Mark. I do live in Los Angeles, so that is my vantage point.  I have lived and traveled other places, of course, but I can't say whether I noticed a difference in the glasses-wearing of gay guys.  I will say that on a recent trip to New York City, I was a little disappointed in the crowds I saw at a few places I visited -- both glasses-wise and otherwise.  But I think it takes me a little time to warm up to a place and get comfortable, so maybe that's part of the equation. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2003, 02:55</p><p>Hmmm. I was thinking that in most cities in the UK there isn't a choice of gay bars. London's different, and maybe Manchester; almost everywhere else it's Hobson's choice - except that you can choose contacts, squinting, or sticking our like a sore thumb. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2003, 23:23</p><p>I wonder if there are regional differences at work. My own highly anecdotal observations make me thing that seeing guys wearing glasses out in bars is more common in cities such as New York and San Francisco than in LA for example. And while in Amsterdam recently, I noticed several guys wearing them in a bathhouse of all places. But then when we went on to Cape Town during the same trip, I only noticed one guy out of several hundred in a bar on a Saturday night. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2003, 20:56</p><p>The other thing I meant to say in the last post is that although I see guys with glasses in gay bars, a guy in a gay bar setting wearing glasses with a high prescription is EXTREMELY rare -- especially a relatively young, good looking guy. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2003, 20:34</p><p>Well, there are so many different kinds of gay bars -- this one was not a "pretty boy" type of place, although there are always some very good looking guys.  But the place is definitely anything goes as far as dress and it tends to draw an older crowd (but still attracts all ages.)   </p><p> </p><p>As for my experience, I see glasses being worn in all kinds of gay places, but definitely less than at an equivalent "straight place."   </p><p> </p><p>This guy was definitely trying to make a statement, and he was unusual....I'm not sure what kind of statement, but I liked it !  He didn't seem to notice I was alive, but that was OK....  His glasses were high index and they weren't thick. Only an OO like me would have noticed the strongish RX.  But strong it was and he looked awesome wearing them!  He would have been quite challenged without them firmly ensconced on his shaved head!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2003, 01:53</p><p>Tinyeyes: what a sight that sounds (so to speak)! What I've seen in gay bars, and heard about them, is that wearing glasses is, well, countercultural. Am I wrong, or was this an unusual bar or an unusual evening? </p><p>Just thinking about a couple I knew, one was -5ish and put in contacts (he's had LASIK now ::( )and the other put his glasses away and squinted. And I remember a bar in Paris where a group of us stood out like sore thumbs both because we were far older than most of the crowd and because we all wore glasses - the only other spexy guy in the place was a pretty boy with low plus lenses in gold frames...which weren't putting off the guy he was getting off with. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2003, 23:15</p><p>Tonight I was at one of the gay bars I like to visit, (this one a semi-leather bar) and there were a number of guys with glasses. But the standout was a hunky, very muscular guy, age probably mid 30s, shirtless and showing it off.  He seemed to have shaved every possible hair on his body, including his head, but he was boldly wearing a stylish pair of small black rim glasses with power-packed high index lenses in them. I suspect he may have been wearing his glasses for effect, but this dude really needed them! His RX must have been around -5 or -6. It was a sexy look. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2003, 18:03</p><p>Tinyeyes:- Thanks for your posting. I guess it must be easier to borrow someones glasses if you yourself rely on them. </p><p> </p><p>Best wishes, </p><p> </p><p>Tony</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2003, 08:13</p><p>Yes, I am -8 and maybe it's strange that I like the idea of guys with high prescriptions losing their glasses, but at least I can sympathize! It's almost seems a little cruel for those of us with perfect vision who want to "steal" some poor high myope's glasses!   8-)  </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, as far as losing my own glasses while out -- it hasn't really happened.  I wear contacts about 95% of the time, so there aren't a lot of opportunities. What has happened to me a couple of times is when, for some some strange reason, both of my hard contacts went "off center" in my eyes at the same time, leaving me blind.  One time it happend at work and I had to walk down the hall to the bathroom (to find a mirror to readjust the lenses.)  It was a very strange feeling.  I am myopic enough that when people walked by in the hall, I wasn't sure who they were because they were just blurs.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2003, 06:26</p><p>Tinyeyes:- Just realised you are minus 8. </p><p> </p><p>It seems kinda surprising that you like to see guys searching for thier high power glasses when you are in the same boat. </p><p> </p><p>Have you ever lost your glasses whilst out? </p><p> </p><p>Being a person with high myopia you are probably in a good position to start an OO conversation with a high myope?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2003, 22:37</p><p>Tinyeyes' story reminded me of my first roommate in college. My roommate went to the restroom to check something in his eye and put down his glasses. He had a very strong prescription. His girlfriend at the time walked in after him and asked what he was worried about. His eye looked fine to her. Devious sneaky me decided to hide his glasses. He came back, realized they weren't on the bed and grew frustrated. I remember him also doing the inch by inch search of the area around the bed. After a minute, I said I had them. His girlfriend said that I wasn't nice. I said that I figured that he'd be able to find them. She said that he has a very strong prescription. He just agreed with her. Thinking back I believe his prescription was probably a -7 or -8. He was cute though. I don't go after straight guys though. </p><p> </p><p>David </p><p> </p><p>PS I personally find farsighted guys cool. My one eye doctor was farsighted and said he was a +5 with astigmatism. He was all eyes, but was cute. By that his eyes were very magnified.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2003, 17:52</p><p>A lovely story Tinyeyes. Do you have a strong rx too?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2003, 08:14</p><p>I think most high myopes are pretty careful to wear their lenses at all times, or keep them at close range if they are not wearing them (as when sleeping or showering or something.)  I love fantasizing about a guy losing his glasses, though--getting them knocked off while playing sports, for instance, or maybe someone stealing them for a joke so he can't find them when he wakes up.   </p><p> </p><p>Once I had an "intimate encounter" (trying to be relatively discreet here) with an EXTREMEMLY myopic man -- his RX had to be well over -10 and probably closer to -15.  He went to take a shower and put the glasses down in the bathroom.  When he came out, he walked into the bedroom, bare-eyed, where I was.  He thought he had left the glasses in the bedroom, and I watched as he searched for them, which for him meant walking about the room and leaning over every article of furniture in the room, running his face over it to see if his glasses were there--he needed to put his eyes just a few inches away to see if the glasses were there or not.  After enjoying that, I think I let him know that they were in the bathroom.  I'm amazed that he was willing to walk around bare-eyed like that at all, but he was in his own house, and I think most high myopes are much more willing to walk around bare-eyed at home than in an unfamiliar place -- but even so, with his high RX, the glasses were very invisible. </p><p> </p><p>As for me, the worst I can remember is maybe a couple of times where I knocked my glasses off the bedside table during the night in my sleep.  I woke up, reached for my glasses and they weren't there.  A moment of slight panic followed as I scrambled out of bed and kneeled on the floor to find them between the bed and nightstand.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lurksalot</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2003, 00:17</p><p>tinyeyes: It must be pretty wild being that nearsighted. Have you ever lost your glasses and couldn't find them? I've never personally seen a high myope lose his/her glasses except for the too-rare occations on tv when it happens. And even then they are usually found quickly...not nearly long enough. Concidering that, I don't think that I would be in any hurry for the mall guy to get his glasses back. Maybe after a couple of hours. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2003, 23:29</p><p>One more thing, Lurksalot: although it would be fun to watch someone like my mall guy groping to find his glasses, nothing would please me more than to return his coke bottles to him by putting them on his handsome face for him.  Hopefully my reward would be a kiss!  (Dream on!)  :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2003, 23:26</p><p>Lurksalot: Yes, I can imagine him doing that, because I would be in the same boat myself without glasses or contacts, since my prescription is -8!  </p><p> </p><p>Yesterday, I was at a sandwich shop and a tall, dark featured, goodlooking guy probably in his late 20s came in, wearing very nice rectangular sunglasses that were obviously prescription. The fronts were very flat and I could see some cut-in behind the dark lenses.  I didn't notice at first that he also had a pair of clear oval wire rims hanging on his shirt collar, with the same RX.  He kept the sunglasses on the whole time even though we were indoors (it was a sunny room).  He was maybe -5 or -6.  Very nice (looking) although he seemed to be in kind of a sour mood.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lurksalot</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2003, 22:52</p><p>tiny eyes: your sighting on december 2nd at the mall sounds awesome! I can almost picture him on his hands and knees helplessly groping for his coke-bottle glasses. If I saw someone like him lose his glasses I don't know if I would help him find them, at least not right away. The villionous part of me would be tempted to pick them up to make sure that he wouldn't find them. Can you imagine him trying to feel his way around the mall?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Teah</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2003, 11:24</p><p>i have an interesting sighting to report.... </p><p>i was at court last week (don't worry, i was safely behind the barrier thing, in the audience) and the judge's assistant was a tall, light skinned black man, with rectangular specs, they were silver-colored wire rims, but the frames were sort of drawfed by the lenses -- i'm bad at guessing prescriptions, but they had plano fronts, tons of concentric rings, and definatly an AR coating. the glasses were quite small, to minimize the thickness i suppose. anyway, it was wonderful to have him there because i had to sit there all day and it did get rather boring at times but i had him to stare at anyway.  </p><p> </p><p>happy new year everybody, and joyeuse fête des rois (happy king's day) to all the french people on here, and anyone else who might celebrate.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2003, 15:44</p><p>Happy New Year!  Here's a little sighting:   </p><p> </p><p>Yesterday I went shopping at a clothing store (Urban Outfitters) and there was a guy who was working there who was drop dead cute....  mid 20s, compact muscular build and showing it in a snug t-shirt, super short buzz cut hair, tan and adorable....and wearing cute oval wire rims that were around -4 or so....he was friendly and smiled at me more than once....definitely gay.  His glasses were sliding down pretty far on his nose, and I watched as he helped a customer and never pushed them up! He looked at the customer and only part of his eyes were covered by the lenses, but I'm sure he had to look through that part to see the customer (or anyone else) because the RX looked that strong.  So sexy!!!! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2002, 22:12</p><p>By the way, I just realized that this "Guys With Glasses" thread just had its first anniversary a few days ago.  Congratulations! I hope more people will continue to post interesting sightings and stories.   </p><p> </p><p>I took a plane trip today (always a good chance for sightings) and saw a number of very myopic men. Among them were a middleaged, heavyset man wearing thick wire rims that were definitely at least -10 and probably considerably higher; a cute blondish dad, mid 30s, also wearing small wire rims and probably around -10, with little boy in tow; and sat on the plane right next to a very nice guy, early 30s, who turned out to be gay, who was wearing roundish glasses with around -7 or so.  Kind of cute and kind of nerdy at the same time -- we had a nice conversation but not about glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2002, 21:40</p><p>Well, the other interesting encounter is someone I met last weekend who I am very interested in, and the feeling is mutual.  However, I have found out a little more about him and it won't be easy to try to date this person.  He's very cute, 30 years old, about -8 and wears glasses most of the time...and looks fantastic in his glasses.  That's about all there is to tell right now.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2002, 14:11</p><p>Oh yeah, and forgot to mention, Sid kept sexily adjusting his glasses the whole time I was "working in" with him.  If only he knew what a turnon that is!! Unfortunately, I was in my contacts, or maybe I would have attempted a swap....although he seemed completely uninterested in his own glasses, in spite of how desperately he needs them!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2002, 14:08</p><p>I had a great sighting today!  I was at the gym (I go there a lot and there are some very attractive guys there.)  I saw a guy I had never seen before, at least in glasses.  Description: late 20s (ish), white, tall, well built, short dark hair, tan, wearing an Abercrombie muscle shirt and shorts while working out. He also had a baseball cap which he put on backwards later -- sexy detail. Definitely a West Hollywood look, and good looking enough to be the model/actor type.  When I saw him it was from behind, and he was sitting on the bench press, reading a newspaper (at far less than arm's length) between sets. To myself I said "Oh my God!" when from behind I could see a sparkling miniature world through his glasses!  I walked by and got a look at him, and WOW, what a view!  Gorgeous face, blue eyes, tiny of course, behind beautiful stylish rectangular plastic frames that were grayish in color, and complimented his eyes perfectly. The cut in, reflections and rings were so beautiful.  The frames were medium in size and there were no visible lens edges, indicating very high index lenses. My guess of prescription is -6, maybe -7.  This is the type of guy who must wear contacts 90% of the time, but not this morning!  He actually acknowledged my presence with a nod (this gorgeous type seldom does), and as luck would have it, I needed to use the bench press, so a couple of minutes later I went over and asked him if I could "work in."  Well, he was agreeable, and of course, I was in heaven! He ended up asking me to "spot" him, which means making sure he can handle the weight while I look down at his gorgeous blue eyes tiny behind those coke bottles!  I introduced myself and he told me his name was Sid.  I complimented his glasses, and asked him where he got them, and he very flatly replied, "At my optometrist's", and seemed vaguely annoyed by the question.  I doubt this guy has any interest in me whatsoever, but he was friendly enough to give me a workout tip, and later, when he walked by, said "See you later" with a small smile.  So, Sid made my day!  </p><p> </p><p>I had an even better sighting/encounter this weekend that I'm not telling about yet because I don't want to jinx it! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kix</b>&nbsp;10 Dec 2002, 17:40</p><p>Been meaning to post about my office mate, he usually wears contacts but every once in a while, about 5-6 times a month, turns up in a pair of low-minus glasses. Nice, semi-rimless frames, strong enough for a bit of minification and he wears them full time, around -2 I would guess. He's a cute guy for sure--mid twenties, tall and slender, close cropped dark hair, deep brown eyes and olive skin (but not my type, plus he has a girlfriend). He looks great with glasses and he's a nice guy. He said once he usually wears his glasses after a long night out or if his allergies are getting to him...apparently his girlfriend has cats. Definitely a catch though. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2002, 14:28</p><p>... and what's so cute about that sighting, tiny, is that you yourself were watching everything through two very strong contact lenses :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2002, 21:00</p><p>I had 2 pretty good sightings today. First was at lunch, in a busy food court at a mall near a lot of offices.  I saw 2 cute guys, both thirtyish, dressed in shirt and tie, waiting for their lunch orders...  the shorter of the two, who was really very cute, with short blondish hair, had VERY strong minus glasses on. WOW! When I first saw him it was from behind, but of course I could tell his were no ordinary lenses from the way they flashed and the miniature world inside them.  Of course, I loitered to get a better look at him (without being too obvious of course.) When he turned to talk to his friend, I saw that his stylish rectangular wire frames packed what must be at least -10 diopters.  Deep cut-in, power rings, and super high index lenses, but I could still see a bit of polished lens edge bulging out.  He was truly tinyeyed and downright adorable.  In the couple of minutes I was watching, he adjusted his glasses once -- and I thought, "Yeah, you better keep those glasses adjusted boy, as badly as you need them!"  He would have been so lost in that mall without his little coke bottles.  WOW!  </p><p> </p><p>Then tonight, I stopped at the market....very cute mid- to late-twenties guy, white, blue eyes, not-too-short brown hair, and plastic framed stylish small rectangular glasses with bits of shiny metal at each temple. Unfortunately (in my view) he had his girlfriend in tow, but that didn't stop me from catching glimpses of him and his beautiful glasses. Also high index, and maybe -6 lenses.  Just adorable, although the lunch guy was definitely my favorite -- he was just as cute and his RX just sends me to the moon!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2002, 19:10</p><p>Fot the one plus and one minus group of glasses wearers (it can hardly be called a crowd), contacts are the way to go when it comes to optimum vision. The distortion that comes from wearing a pair of lenses in considerable variation to each other is much reduced if those lenses are directly on the eye, as with contact lenses. </p><p> </p><p>This situation is well known, and has been discussed before on this forum.  </p><p> </p><p>The other point I was trying to make is for those whose eyesight is such that one eye does all or most of the seeing, contact lenses, with their possible problems of infection, etc. might be a risk they may not want to take. Those with their best vision in one eye should be wearing polycarbonate safety glasses and not using contact lenses. </p><p> </p><p>Footnotes available. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2002, 14:34</p><p>Portia, I'm interested in what you say (who is this TOLL FREE dork?) because I'm sure I've read the exact opposite advice somewhere&gt; This writer was saying that if you have a big difference in Rx betwen the eyes, especially one plus and one minus, spectacle lenses will give you two images of different sizes, whereas contacts, being just that, give you two clear images of the same size - and are therefore better. </p><p>Anyone else have any wisdom to offer? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>TOLL FREE</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2002, 02:30</p><p>1-888-379-9266</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2002, 23:15</p><p>Ben, as you may already have seen, there's something here at EYESCENE for everyone. </p><p> </p><p>If the difference in Rx between your eyes is substantial, you should not be wearing contacts. There is a fine line between wearing contacts on dissimmilar eyes for optimal vision purposes and sheer foolishness if the eyes are so different that any problem with the contact in the better-seeing eye might result in being dependent on a less well seeing eye.  </p><p> </p><p>In other words, if there is a very significan disparity in acuity between your eyes, you are well-advised to wear impact-resistant glasses at all times. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ben</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2002, 16:33</p><p>Tinyeyes, </p><p>My work is with computers in a large government office. Its not my preferred choice wearing contacts but for all round vision they are the best option. The rest of the time I wear glasses to give my eyes a chance to breathe. Also, when I was going to school I was the butt of some jokes questioning my ability to see anything even with glasses. So for many years I wore contacts all of the time. Now being braver I wear glasses as much as possible and I must say I enjoy it. Strange as it may seem I get a buzz from it.  My contacts are GP.  </p><p> </p><p>Tommy, </p><p>Im afraid I dont know much about hi-index lenses. But over the last few years my lenses have gotten less thick (mind you my frames are quite small but my prescription has increased by a minus 1 every two/three years). I was recommended the 1.8 even though they are quite expensive. Like you glasses on ladies are a no no whereas on men they are a yes yes. Can anyone explain this?  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2002, 08:51</p><p>Hi Ben,  </p><p> </p><p>I've been reading the thread about you with interest.  I'm curious: what type of work do you do that makes you prefer contact lenses for work?  And, if you do well with contacts at work, why do you prefer to wear glasses the rest of the time?  I'm assuming your vision is a lot better with the contacts, right? Are they hard or soft?  Thanks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2002, 20:40</p><p>Ben, thanks for your continuing information.  Interesting, the male high minus really interests me but the female not at all.  I don't understand about the details of the hi-index, like the 1.7 or 1.8, can you expound?  I do know that my minus 6 seems to have gotten thinner over the past few years, and more expensive some of which has to do with the progressives.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2002, 17:16</p><p>You are most welcome here Ben.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ben</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2002, 16:30</p><p>Alan. </p><p>Ive made a mistake. My lenses are 1.8 glass. At the time my Optician told me that 1.9 wouldnt make much of a difference, as my frames are quite small. They are neat for such a high prescription. The thickness at the edge is 8mm.Obviously my eyes look minute and there are a lot of rings. My vision is reasonable. At present I can still drive as I am within the permitted limits. The vision in my left eye is 6/9 (not sure what this means ). At work I wear contact lenses for all round vision. All other times I wear glasses. </p><p> </p><p>My original search was on  MSN.I typed extreme myopia hi-index lenses (I was looking for up-to-date information.).As a result, Guys in Glasses was one of the options I came across.I hope I didnt sound judgemental in my last spiel. It was never my intension. Being truthful I never had a gay relationship but I have a fascination for guys with a high minus prescription like mine. I guess its a fetish.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2002, 22:59</p><p>Sure, this thread is basically for people (yes, guys first of all) who like guys in glasses - but what the hell, there's the odd digression in every thread. Ben, I hope you find what you're looking for. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2002, 21:46</p><p>Ben - what did you mean when you said your original search was for high index lenses?    </p><p> </p><p>You mentioned you have the 1.9 lenses, which is amazingly high (the highest I've heard of).  What do you think of them?  Is the vision good?  How is your vision in your stronger eye? </p><p> </p><p>I think it's very understandable that you would be wary.  Do you wear contacts at all? </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>teah</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2002, 20:02</p><p>ben: this thread is for people who are interested in and find guys with glasses attractive. there are several straight girls, as myself, and many gay guys. hey, we're physically attracted to the same people so it's all good! we both contribute.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ben</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2002, 15:31</p><p>Thanks for the tips guys. I guess Im a little wary as I have vision in one eye.

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2002, 10:18</p><p>Ben </p><p> </p><p>have you considered RGP's and goggles? the hard lenses won't absorb water and bacteria like soft ones will and, as alan suggests, you take them out immediately after swimming you probably won't have problems.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2002, 10:40</p><p>Ben - I think that the danger wearing contacts while swimming is primarily from water contacting your eyes.  A good pair of goggles should shield you from that.  It's conceivable I'm wrong, and you should ask an eye doctor, but this seems like it would work.  Another option might be to clean your contacts (and eyes) immediately after swimming.  Contacts don't make your eyes "immediately" more susceptible to infection - they just allow pathogens to brew underneath your contacts, as far as I know. </p><p> </p><p>Prescription goggles should also be an option if you find the right person.  And if you can only get swim goggles that are, say, -10, that will at least help some. </p><p> </p><p>Obviously, your only choices (without surgery) are to wear contacts, wear some kind of goggles or glasses, or find a way to deal with the blur.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2002, 16:20</p><p>Julian, cable temples are the ones that are very round and wind behind the ear. the sense I get from looking at them is that they are almost a permanent installation. very secure.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2002, 16:12</p><p>Cable temples?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2002, 15:38</p><p>Ben, thanks for sharing your information. </p><p> </p><p>Suggest using the myos, which you apparently are not using, for swimming, with a snug sport strap to keep them in place.  I know they will be all wet and sometimes fog up but they will give you a more secure feeling than going without.  Regarding the wrap around the ear temples, a friend used to wear them but now does not, don't know reason for change.  Assume you want to keep your glasses in place better because they may be heavy and slip?  Anyway, they are called cable something or other as I recall.  Any good optician should have some selection of these.  I don't think just any pair of frames can be adapted.  Will try to think of the correct name.  I also need to get an mm ruler so I know what you and others have when providing metric information. </p><p></p><hr>

The lenses are about 8 millimetres thick at the edges with many many rings.My frames are made of Titanium with a matt bronze finish.They are quite small.The lenses are 42 millimetres in width.The frame is mainly rectangular but also oval at the edges if that makes sense.I used to have myodiscs but I always had difficulty with the peripheral vision.I was told that I looked like an owl which is strange as an owl has big eyes.It must have been the frames.They were like Harry Potters.( incidentally Im looking for a smaller frame and where they completely wrap around the back of your ears like a coil.Anyone know where I can get a pair ). </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2002, 05:14</p><p>Ben, I do more casual swimming so use an old pair of regular glasses, sometimes with a sports strap.  Don't know how you go bareyed with your strong minus as I am only about -6 and feel very disoriented in the pool without glasses.  I have 2 friends who swim with contacts and goggles and have had no problems that I know of.  I thought as you do that contacts should not be worn when swimming.  Another friend mentioned he once had his contacts float away when he opened his eyes underwater.  What is the max Rx for goggles?  Would a partial corection using goggles be of help in your case?  What was your progression to -17.5?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ben</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2002, 04:04</p><p>I have but I have been told that wearing contacts in swimming pools can be quie dangerous.Apparently there is some kind of bug you can pick up which causes great damage to the eye.I don't think it's worth the risk.I also have a lazy eye so I have to be extra vigilant.Any other ideas?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2002, 05:59</p><p>Teah - I think there's a yahoo group called "domscoolguysinglasses".  You should be able to go to groups.yahoo.com and search for it &amp; join.  I haven't visited for a long time (girls in glasses are 'my thing'), but I think there are a lot of good pictures there. </p><p> </p><p>Also, the photographer who put up a lot of pics of "Yana" also had a few of guys in glasses, I think.  (But only a few.)  Look on the "Seen on the Web" thread, view all posts, and search for "Yana".  That should give you the link.  (This photographer is really good, too, in my opinion.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>teah</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2002, 20:39</p><p>i've seen dozens and dozens of sites on the web dedicated to girls in glasses. many (if not the majority) of these guys feel glasses are way cooler on girls than on guys. hmm maybe it's because i'm a girl myself, but i absolutly loooove them on guys. they're awesome on girls...but it's something special and cool and ...wonderful on a guy for me. i was wandering wether any of you guys knew of any sites out there (other than this single posting thread) dedicated to GUYS IN GLASSES </p><p> thanks :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2002, 14:08</p><p>Yes, Julian, you're right, I was cheating the public (or at least any OOs if they were watching, which is doubtful): I was wearing my contacts.  And yes, I am around -8 or -9.  I don't know what to say, it depends on how you add up the numbers.  My contacts are -8.5 and my glasses are -8 with astigmatism corrections. I've probably said this before, but besides vanity, there is the fact that with my strange prescripton I see much better with hard RGP contacts than I do with glasses.  The vision in my left eye tends to be slightly blurred with glasses. But anyway, I do wear my glasses in public sometimes...early in the morning or on airplanes or two common times. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tim</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2002, 05:13</p><p>hi dear singa i looked for the film but i think its not a movie but a serie i look for such films and hope someone can put here some titles the operation mozart has i think so many parts.</p><p></p><hr>

There is a youngster (mabe 14 to 16 y.o. who wear plusglasses (about + 3 to 4.00) The frame in brown plastic and a little bit aviator style. Him take off his glasses many times and also in a scene he loose his glasses and some people walking on them and than the glasses was broken.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2002, 02:10</p><p>tinyeyes: Thanks for those two delicious sightings. But what about yourself? Were you wearing your adorable -9s (about that, isn't it?) or cheating your public with contacts? :;) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tim</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2002, 01:27</p><p>to all especially plusheavy  do you know further films with strong glasses and its important that the actor not only wears them but lost them or gets them broken i hope someone knows a good movie </p><p>greatings from tim</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;04 Nov 2002, 15:27</p><p>This section of the site is awfully dead right now!  Well, just wanted to report some yummy sightings. Wish I had photos, but all I can do is describe them. First off was at a bar here in L.A. -- one of the newest and trendiest.  They were having a special theme night where the (all young and adorable) bartenders and barbacks all wear little warmup style long pants and nothing else -- very cute. Except for one of them, who also wears his adorable rimless rectangular glasses with an RX of at least -3 or -4. He's one of the best looking, age under 25 for sure, with a gorgeous body and short brown wavy hair, and the glasses only enhance the look! I'm surprised the boss didn't require to ditch the glasses for a pair of contacts, but I'm glad he didn't.  </p><p> </p><p>Then today, another adorable young (mid 20s probably) guy at the gym, cute as can be, tall and slim, dark hair and hazelish eyes, very toned body, tatoos and super short dark hair.  His glasses were small rectangular wire rims and also possibly around -4 or so -- hard to tell, but whatever they were they had a lot of power rings (astigmatism maybe?) Extremely cute and the type that probably normally wears contacts but looks SOOOO great in his little glasses!!     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2002, 10:23</p><p>Thanks for the tip OGL. I checked '20/20 online' which served the purpose. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2002, 02:54</p><p>Hi Tim </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately I don't have the titles because I change many times the programmes and look for glassesboys, so I don't wrote all the titles. Sorry. </p><p> </p><p>Greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;21 Oct 2002, 18:36</p><p>Am posting this one here for Julian or anyone else who may be interested. The October issue of 20/20 was devoted to men in glasses.  If someone wants to send me an e-mail crubthrunch@hotmail.com with their snail mail address I'll clip the photos of the models and related ads (bear in mind they are plano lenses, of course) so that you can scan and post wherever. As you know, I am cybernetically challenged in both equipment and skills or I would do it myself.  While that issue wasn't of interest to me, it did contain a 1 credit ABO approved continuing education course on new lenses and lens materials so at least I'll something for my free subscription!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2002, 07:30</p><p>Hi together </p><p> </p><p>I'am back from Asia and saw a lot nice Boys with glasses. I read yet this tread about movies with Boys in glasses. </p><p>In Europe I saw also many nice movies with glassesboys and I record the parts with the glassesboys on video, also i record many glassesboys in shows or so. </p><p>I had 5 videos full with nice glassesboys, in all about more than 10 hours. This year I make all new in my house (painting etc.) and I put all my videos in a box. Unfortunately 1 man working for me put away this box and I can not following. Many years collection of glassesboys going forever, I'am very sad about that. Now I must start again and I have again 20 minutes with nice glassesboys. </p><p> </p><p>Greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tim</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2002, 04:06</p><p>sorry to hear dom but what about a film with no squinting at all thats boring.but i think you said the tripods is it worth buying it! and of course the film fortress 1 the guy had lost his stong plus glasses and is indeed helpless!! i want to say there are some movies!! plusheavy where are your further tipps??dom your story was great!!!!!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2002, 03:51</p><p>Eustace, we've been starved of sexy stories for so long - please post them! Thanks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2002, 19:25</p><p>Eustace - there is a "Miscellaneous Stories" thread, which is good for stories that are quite short.  Or you can ask Wurm to create a new thread for your story/stories.  If it's an especially "Guys in Glasses" story, this might be the place, but stories with their own thread are easier to find later on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eustace</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2002, 18:40</p><p> </p><p>I have (at least in my head) two or three stories (fiction and definitely gay) about very nearsighted guys.

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2002, 21:32</p><p>Dom, </p><p> </p><p>For the record, maybe one person thought your story was boring, but most of us loved the story and eagerly awaited each installment.  It was a wonderful, very exciting story, and I'm sure many would join me in asking you to PLEASE continue it or write another one!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2002, 13:17</p><p>I did write a story about a guy with -11 glasses but I've no idea what happened to it. I didn't finish it because people thought it was boring. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2002, 13:16</p><p>Tim, I hate to tell you this, but there aren't that many films built around guys helpless and squinting without their specs.  </p><p> </p><p>Incidentally, Derek Jarman's film Wittgenstein is interesting: the lad who plays the philosopher as a boy is pretty myopic and takes off his nice minus glasses a couple of times. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;12 Oct 2002, 16:29</p><p>I've posted this on the "Celebs" section as well.  Maybe someone on here has mentioned this before, but I just realized (when seeing a photo) that the actor Richard Dreyfuss is not only sometimes photographed wearing glasses, but he is QUITE nearsighted...possibly in the -8 range? I have only seen small photos so it's hard to tell.  He's getting older now but I think was quite handsome in his day.  He obviously performed most of his roles wearing powerful contacts.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>michael</b>&nbsp;12 Oct 2002, 01:18</p><p>This site has inspired me to look more closely at people.  Today saw 3 guys in a cafe, all magnificently bespecacled, all between -3 and -5, one in particular a beauty to behold.  If only.....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2002, 17:58</p><p> </p><p>Is anyone else old enough to remember the old "Loretta Young Show" on television in the 50's?  Aside from Loretta's glamorous entrance, descending from a spiral staircase and twirling her pleated dress, the dramas were actually rather original.  Once she played a professional woman who won a very expensive wrist watch (from a well-know manufacturer of watches) in some kind of national contest, which was given a great deal of media publicity.  She declined the prize because she insisted that she had the ability to tell the exact time without look at at time piece.  The watch company became very concerned--somehow for fear that it would negatively affect the sale of their watches. </p><p> </p><p>But all this is by way of introduction.  In the more relevant episode, she played the mother of an extremely nearsighted boy, around 7 or so.  Mother and son were vacationing in some remote area that had a lot of tall grassy, seaside vegatation.  The boy was playing in a the grasses and witnessed a murder, and the murderer saw the boy and then begin stalking him to kill him.  But, just before witnessing the murder, the boy had somehow lost his glasses in the grasslands and could not possibly have identified the murderer.  The murderer confronted Loretta Young and her young son, threatening to kill them both. And Loretta was passionately trying to convince the murderer that her son could not possibly identify him.  I have forgoten just how the story ended,  But, for some reason I have always rememberd this episode--because, I suppose, that even as a child, I was fascinated by other children (especially boys) who wore glasses--and the thicker the lenses the better.  </p><p> </p><p>Eustace</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tim</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2002, 01:58</p><p>no post yet????</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tim</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2002, 03:58</p><p>hi there dom! thanks for posting some films but which film is it worth to look for?? for example i think the babysitter with jeremy london contains no good scene only the actor wears glasses he puts them sometimes on and up but no squint or the glasses are not important i look for films where glasses are important perhaps they break or the actor is helpless which films are here to count? i love such films!! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;07 Oct 2002, 15:55</p><p>Great advice, Plusheavy - thanks. I thought Robbie Benson wore planos in Jeremy, but that's based only on a publicity shot. I have Illegally Yours on tape: Rob's specs are a bit lower than minus 3, and, yes, in some shots they are plano. As young OO it always used to puzzle me that myopic actors would wear real minus specs in some shots and then a few seconds later the lenses would be plain plastic. The explanation is that the normal lenses would reflect the lights in close-up, so they'd have to be switched. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tim</b>&nbsp;07 Oct 2002, 13:43</p><p>hi plusheavy!! thanks a lot for posting so many movies with glassesboys!! i will look fdor them: and hope for more... thanks!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>plusheavy</b>&nbsp;07 Oct 2002, 10:40</p><p>River Phoenix might have been hyperopic, but though I overestimated his -5, the glasses he wore in "Explorers" and later in "Lost Years" (?) did look minus. In both films Phoenix has problems with his glasses, for example trying to play baseball. </p><p>  A few more items from my collection: </p><p>1. Gate II - a horror featuring Loius Tripp with authentic minus glasses which fall off his nose on at least two occasions. His right lens looks like -7 with the left one a little weaker. The first scene shows a terrific cut-in on the right (our left) side of his face. </p><p>2. Jeremy - with Robby Benson with a marvelous opening scene in which Robby wakes up for night's sleep and immediately puts on his glasses with decent looking minus lenses. He wears them throughout the film even during a tempestuous basketball episode. </p><p>3. Bad Influence with James Spader wearing thickish minus glasses which half way through the film fall off his nose to the floor to perform a series of spectacular bumps. </p><p>4. Slap Shot - absoltely smashing. Three bespectackled hockey players shown taking part in most brutal fights on ice (wearing no helmets!!) with their monstrously thick plus glasses being knocked off, broken, etc. There is a thrilling scene in which one of them becomes virtually blind when his glasses land on ice. An absolute must. </p><p>5. Nerds - abounds in glasses of all powers on guys' noses and all manner of spexy episodes. One of the guys, wearing extremely thick plus glasses is still nearly blind. </p><p>6. Illegally Yours - with Rob Lowe wearing delicious -3 glasses (at first they look like planos), which get damaged towards the end of the film and leave him nearly blind. His younger brotjher wears even stronger glasses. The film starts with one of the best glasses-in-the rain scenes you have ever seen. </p><p>To be continued</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>henry</b>&nbsp;05 Oct 2002, 17:17</p><p>Dom, </p><p>Any news on the Italian looking guy?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;05 Oct 2002, 16:28</p><p>I think I can help, since this is a subject that obsesses me :) </p><p> </p><p>1. The Chosen, about Jewish boys in New York, came out in the early 80s. Good movie and should be obtainable. Boy who gets his glasses broken with baseball is a cutie wearing about -3. He often takes them off in the film; they're obviously his real Rx. </p><p>2. Making the Grade, silly brat pack  movie from the mid 80s starring Judd Nelson. There is one amazing scene where a young actor wearing -8s gets them snatched off his face.  </p><p>3. A TV movie which I wish I could find, called Seduced by Madness, where Tobey Maguire plays a geeky boy wearing -4 specs. </p><p>4. Gattaca, with Ethan Hawke gorgeous in -5 rimless specs - alas only briefly., though there's a scene where he tries to cross a road without his contact lenses and nearly gets run over. He's a real lif myope - his novel The Hottest State has so many accurate-sounding references to myopia. </p><p>5. A British sci-fi series called The Tripods, available in the UK on DVD and video. There's a nerdy tall boy in it called Beanpole who wears his own plano home-made specs at the beginning but then changes into -4 designer specs - apparently the actor just couldn't see without his correction. </p><p>6. A couple of brief but lovely scenes in Dazed and Confused, where real-life myope Anthony Rapp plays a 70s geek with long hair and thickish minus specs.   </p><p>7. The Babysitter, with Jeremy London pre-Lasik, specs about -2/3, takes them off quite a lot. </p><p> </p><p>But River Phoenix was a hyperope!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;04 Oct 2002, 17:10</p><p>Another one: also today, I was driving and next to me in traffic waiting at a stoplight was a guy, probably around 40, not particularly attractive but wearing rather thick coke-bottles that were at least -7.  What was interesting is that he was squinting and closing one eye to look at a billboard (which was only about a 200 feet away.)  Apparently his high prescription is in need of an update...although I've never known of high myopes closing one eye to look at something in the distance with their glasses on.  And this guy was driving!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;04 Oct 2002, 17:06</p><p>Quick sighting today: I was in line at th bank and there was a rather effeminate looking guy (mainly his manner rather than his dress) who I couldn't help but notice.  He was maybe in his late 20s, small slight build, short reddish hair and very fair skin....there was nothing slight about his glasses though.  He was wearing fairly large (but today's standards) black plastic rimmed glasses, with a prescription of probably -7 or -8.  I was interested and he was most definitely gay, but he was nervously waiting and I was ahead of him in line, and his nearsighted eyes never caught my gaze --- until the end, maybe, when he looked back at me as he got into his car.  A little on the femme side, but a nice package!  Maybe I'll see him again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;03 Oct 2002, 08:36</p><p>Tim, I think you are right about the Brady Bunch episode -- it is called "Juliet of the Sun."  I haven't seen it in years, but the boy in the episode is not really wearing very powerful glasses if I remember correctly. I think he may even be wearing plus lenses, but he acts extremely nearsighted. That's why I said it's goofy!   </p><p> </p><p>As for River Phoenix, why did he wear -5 glasses so much? Was that his real RX?   </p><p> </p><p>I heard there was a movie with Lorenzo Lamas where he wore his real RX (about -5) but I don't know the name of it. Unfortunately, Lamas has had Lasik so we will never again see him in his glasses.  I saw him in an infomercial for Lasik a couple of years ago which showed him VERY briefly in the glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>plusheavy</b>&nbsp;03 Oct 2002, 07:30</p><p>Some film classics with men/boys with extremely thick glasses and with terrifying episodes involving lost glasses are:  </p><p>1. Jerzy Skolimowski's British film "King, Queen, Knave", based on Nabokov's novel, which makes an exciting reading as the Knave conducts an endless battle with his ever breaking and knocked-off glasses. The exciting scenes scenes are faithfully depicted in the film which starts with the knave being completely blinded as a result of having broken his incredibly strong minus glasses. </p><p>2. Public Enemy Nr 1 - with Fernandel ashamed to wear his one-inch thick lenses </p><p>3. Lucas - with Corin Heim breaking his glasses while playing football </p><p>4. The Chosen ones (?) - with the main hero being hit in his bespectaled face with a baseball ball and losing sight in one eye. </p><p>5. The Olsen gang - a series of about 8 Danish comedies with a juvenile memeber of the gang wearing very thick plus lenses </p><p>6. A number of films with River Phoenix wearing thick -5D lenses, which occasionally fall off his nose. </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, these films are hard to find on video and are rarely, if ever, shown in cinemas. It seems that a videoteque containing films with bespectacled fellows who do not merely wear but actually interact with their glasses would contain hundreds if not thousands of films.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;02 Oct 2002, 19:53</p><p> </p><p>I work in a university library and this year I have two beautiful,  adorable, and very bright student assistants, both around 17 or 18.  Both are about 5'8" tall.  One weighs about 130 or so pounds; the other couldn't weigh more than 111. The latter "sings in the choir"(as a Southern friend of mine puts it) whether he knows it or not.  Anyway, the other day the 130-pounder mentioned that he really needed to wear his glasses but his current prescription isn't strong enough, so he doesn't bother.  The 111-pounderr joined in with the fact that he had glasses which he really should wear but doesn't.  I've been watching the 130-pounder more closely, and he regularly squints--when using the computer, looking on the bookshelves, or even just reading.  How do I get them both to wear their glasses, and how do I encourage the 130-pounder to have his eyes examined and get a new pair of (thicker) glasses?  Do I dare tell them that they must wear their glasses at work, as accuracy is essential to their jobs?  And, in contrast to my student assistants, there is a real hunk who is a student but also works on the Buildings and Grounds crew and with whom I am quite friendly (on a casual basis).  He does wear his glasses all the time.  They go wonderfully with the basic white undershirt tank-top that he is still wearing (in October) while at work and which show off his impressive biceps!  Oh, well, I'm just sharing my little fantasies tonight!  Eustace</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;02 Oct 2002, 14:37</p><p>Tim, to answer your question, there are probably a lot of movies that feature strong or not-so-strong glasses prominently on guys.  If the others can help me out maybe we can make a list.  For one thing, there is of course, the new movie I've been talking about, Swimfan.  But there must be others.   </p><p> </p><p>Let's see... </p><p>Anything with Woody Allen, who must be about -5 and always wears glasses in every movie, as far as I know.   </p><p> </p><p>The classic movie "Midnight Cowboy" from 1969 features a minor character, who is gay and about 20 years old, and who wears thick horn-rims with about -6 RX, who tries to have sex with the main character. I read something recently about that actor, who is about 50 years old now, and he really wears glasses and is still acting.   </p><p> </p><p>This is a goofy example, but in the old TV show the Brady Bunch, one of the most remembered episodes features a teenage boy character who wears nerdy glasses and is forced to go without them when he acts in a play with Marcia Brady, and of course he bumps into things and generally acts blind.  Goofy example, but I had to put it in. </p><p> </p><p>Of course, there's the recent movie Spiderman, with the adorable Tobey Maguire, who wears glasses with no discernible RX except in the scene where he suddenly gains superhero powers.   Then they show him looking through the glasses and taking them off (because his vision has improved) and suddenly the glasses have a very real minus RX in them.  If only Tobey had been wearing that pair the whole time!   </p><p> </p><p>A friend told me about a movie starring Bob Saget called "Father Scout", where he is a nerdy young father and wears his real RX glasses throughout the movie.  Saget is probably about a -6.  I never saw this picture though.   </p><p> </p><p>That's all I can think of right now, but there are probably scads of other examples.  Anyone else have any? </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;02 Oct 2002, 13:14</p><p>For what it's worth, I think James is wearing contacts. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, fabulous sighting today. This guy, about 30 and very sporty-looking, was sitting reading some boring papers in my local Starbuck's. (Every other building in Notting Hill is a Starbuck's now.) He was big, muscular and very handsome: short dark hair brushed forward with a quiff, touch of premature grey and just the hint of a bald patch. Firm jaw, big hazel eyes minimised through the smartest specs: sort of grey-green plastic, traditional library shape, high index lenses that were thin but dense with rings at the sides. At first glance they were in the moderate range, but the more I looked at him - and boy, did I look - the stronger they seemed. Minus 8? There was a woman standing right behind him, and when he looked up from his papers she was reduced to the size of a matchstick through his glasses. From time to time he would straighten the frames on his face, without realising he was doing it, I suspect: if this boy wasn't wearing specs by the age of 10 I'd be very surprised. </p><p> </p><p>He was one of those guys who looks so perfectly turned out, in his muscles and Gap chinos, that it's very hard to visualise him doing the "blind as a bat" routine - alarm clock up to his nose, patting down the side table, that sort of thing. Hard, but not impossible ... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tim</b>&nbsp;02 Oct 2002, 08:28</p><p>hello there! i enjoyed reading all the stories but why does no one knows a really good film or movie where a guy wears strong glasses or where the glasses play an important role in this film ???please i need a good tip!there a so many pictures but no good film about this fetish thenme please think and write an answer !!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2002, 09:15</p><p>Regarding DeBello, I looked at that other picture and I agree-- it's impossible to tell if he's wearing contacts, but there is a lot of reflection on his eyes and he certainly could be!  It's too bad there are no pictures of him wearing the movie glasses anywhere, because they are really amazing.   </p><p> </p><p>I suppose it could just be a weird coincidence, but it's hard to imagine someone being cast for a part because they're highly myopic--that means in casting they would have asked every guy to bring his prescription or to wear his glasses for the audition.  Well, I suppose it's possible!  Seems more likely that they would say "You're perfect for the role -- now here, you have to wear these coke bottles for your part!"   And then the plus contacts would have to be ordered, or whatever.   </p><p> </p><p>The glasses he wore made him look  almost like a young Stephen King.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2002, 11:39</p><p>Alan, Christy: yes, it's stupidly critical for the reasons you mention.  I soloed in a little peashooter in 1961 and spent 31 years in the Air Force, the vast majority of which was in the reserves in non-flying positions.  But for 23 of those years I was an additional duty admissions counselor for the Air Force Academy, and as our usual goal was to have 60% of the entering class (it fluctuated over the years)pilot qualified we lost a lot of good potential officers to Canoe U. (Navy at Annapolis) and Hell-On-The-Hudson (Army at West Point).  The pilot standards were ridiculous in themselves, 20/20 each eye and OU uncorrected with no more than + or -.25 refractive error in either eye.  You could go to 20/200 as I recall for navigator qual and even worse for commissioning only, can't remember exactly.  I do remember after my first AF pilot physical I thought my eyeballs had been hung out to dry, cycoplegic refraction, red lens, everything they could think of.  The hypocrisy was after you got your pilot wings you could get pretty bad, especially presbyopic, and still fly.  Don't know much about Navy standards, although I do remember some pretty myopic kids who couldn't get into our place coming back years later with Navy Flight Officer wings, which is our equivalent of a navigator.  FO's also are back seat electronic jammers, radar intercept officers (remember Merlin and Goose, the RIO's in Top Gun?) and weapons systems operators. In modern aircraft the instruments are all important, and quite frankly, as presbyopic as I am at this age would carry two or three extra pairs of glasses in the cockpit.  Contacts used to be verboten because of G-forces and depressurization and other emergencies, but I heard that they'd lightened up on that at least for navs in recent years.  Now my own shrinking memory has piqued, am going to back and check those VA/refractive error parameters.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2002, 10:16</p><p>Admittedly - I know nothing about flying planes - but I've always understood that you are supposed to trust your instruments - rather than what you can see out of the cockpit window! Seems to me that what you really need is good close-up vision - rather than good distance vision!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2002, 09:52</p><p>Does anyone know if the requirement for uncorrected distance vision for air force pilots is actually critical?  I suppose if they are going to weed out 99.5% of the applicants anyway, then they might as well weed out the glasses and contact wearers.  I don't know what the environment is actually like in a cockpit, but it seems like a lot of talent might be getting waived off.  Plus, how many people can't see *better* corrected than uncorrected?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2002, 07:44</p><p>Here's a strange sighting, not because of the frames or rx but because of the military situation.  Was at the Officer's Club on base for few pints the other evening, and one of the flying squadrons (Navy) was having a little get together.  One of them was wearing civilian glasses, a nice looking metal rounded rectangle, and they were at least -5.00 if not higher. He wasn't in a flying suit like most of the rest but was in "suntans", a casual daily uniform and I got a glimpse of his name tag.  He was a little bit Asian looking, and the tag said "CO" which of course is commanding officer and he was a Commander (Officer rank five) which would be consistent with the rank one has to be a CO.  Also, he was wearing aviator wings of some type, but being new at this Navy stuff (I'm Air Force) couldn't really tell what they are.  What is strange is that all of our services covet perfect distance vision to the utmost in the flying ranks, and to even be an aviator in that scrip let alone the CO was kind of mind boggling.  The Navy does let myopics fly as back seaters and/or navigators, but -5.00?  They may have been "flight surgeons", all the services let those geeks fly as passengers an hour or so a month so that they can then swagger about in the flying suits and draw a hell of a lot more money per month than the rest of us, but I don't really know. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2002, 04:37</p><p>I've tried, but I can't persuade myself that I can see a contact lens there. On the other hand, there's a whole gallery of pics of James DeBello on that site, and in a lot of them there is just something about his eyes - not squinting, not bloodshot, but not entirely comfortable. Contacts irritating a bit? After all, in this day and age there's no need for high myopia to stop a guy being an actor. It would just be nice to see him in his specs from time to time - like Freddie Prinze Jr and even occasionally Elijah Wood. </p><p>Incidentally on one of the pics on the site the other guy (Shawn Hatosy) has his glasses hooked on the front of his T-shirt: <a href="http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=granitz&amp;group=0861-car&amp;photo=cookhato.syd&amp;path=pgallery&amp;path_key=DeBello,+James" target="_blank">http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=granitz&amp;group;=0861-car&amp;photo;=cookhato.syd&amp;path;=pgallery&amp;path;_key=DeBello,+James</a></p><p></p><hr>

What do you think?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2002, 19:39</p><p>A guy I had only met once before in a business meeting walked into a group get together this evening and I quickly took a second look as he was wearing strong minus, about -7 I would guess, good looking black plastic rectangular up to date frames.  Lenses extended beyond the frames and one lens flat on front indicating stronger?  Got to talk with him alone for a few minutes and mentioned I liked his frames.  Said he liked mine also etc.  That was it, did not get to talk about Rx etc.  I did say he did not have glasses when we met first time.  His response all about the allergies and how he could not wear his contacts this evening.  Will probably meet again and even if not wearing glasses will be able to engage him in that type conversation since I have now seen him with glasses.  Young and rather cute except for thick, long sideburns.  Would like to see him without.  Any comment on why one lens would be flat if stronger?  My Rx about -6 and frames roung retro tortise Sanford Hutton.  His fefinitely looked stronger, perhaps more than -7 since frames were on the samll side.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;24 Sep 2002, 19:42</p><p>OK, I did a little research about the movie and figured out the actor's name is James DeBello. He's a minor actor just getting started. Boy, oh boy, I thought he had a key role in the movie, but I guess he is seen as a minor character because there certainly aren't any photos available of him from the movie (and hence, with the glasses.) Here is a link to a photo of him: </p><p><a href="http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=granitz&amp;group=1675&amp;photo=JamesDeBel_Vespa_635198_400.jpg&amp;path=pgallery&amp;path_key=DeBello,+James" target="_blank">http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=granitz&amp;group;=1675&amp;photo;=JamesDeBel_Vespa_635198_400.jpg&amp;path;=pgallery&amp;path;_key=DeBello,+James</a> </p><p> </p><p>Hope it works.  He is 22 years old, by the way. Is he really super-nearsighted?  Who knows?? My guess is no. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;24 Sep 2002, 19:06</p><p>I shouldn't have said anything about accommodating in my original post, I guess -- because I don't really think the actor could have accommodated either.  The glasses they used looked almost vintage to me -- they were the large type from the late 1980s or so that produced very thick lenses when made in a high prescription.  And they were flat-fronted.  They were either the guy's real glasses, or he really had that prescription and they were made for him, or contact lenses were fitted. They do a lot of very elaborate things in costuming for motion pictures that are way more complicated than a pair of plus contact lenses, so there's so reason to doubt they could have done that.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2002, 13:03</p><p>SL, </p><p>   The answer to your question is kind of tricky.  I think most people under 25 have at least 5-6 diopters of accomodation available, probably a little more. (And some people have much less.)  This doesn't mean an average person can put on a pair of -6 glasses and see fine in the distance, though; it takes some practice to get used to using that much accomodation without converging the eyes as if looking at something close up.  I doubt anyone but an OO would ever bother doing this, unless for some very weird reason they had to. </p><p>   For a teenager who wasn't nearsighted, I guess adjusting to -8 is a possibility.  But I'd say it is VERY remote.  Much more likely was that he had + contacts fitted.  And much more likely than that, I think (considering how clueless moviemakers usually are to optical details), is that the kid was actually really nearsighted. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SL</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2002, 17:20</p><p>Julian, </p><p>   I suppose they're all-purpose glasses, in that I can see at any distance with them.  But they were prescribed primarily for reading. I'm 21.  </p><p>   So take 8.00 as an upper bound.. I really wish there were some easy way just to experiment with negative lenses.  Positive lenses are easy enough, if you have a supermarket.  Seems unfair.  Maybe somewhere there exists some sort of physics kit with a bunch of little lenses.  Humm... </p><p> </p><p>Cheers, </p><p>Sideling</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2002, 16:16</p><p>Sorry SL, you posted while I was pondering what to say ::)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2002, 16:14</p><p>Yes, I see what you mean. And I think it's unlikely anyone could function with -8 lenses apart from people like tinyeyes who are that myopic - but it's dangerous to make generalizations. But are your glasses genuinely readers or are they all-purpose glasses you only use for reading? How old are you? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SL</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2002, 16:06</p><p>Let me just rephrase the question.  Assume by accommodation I mean positive accommodation, which could be used to counteract negative lenses.  Does anyone know how much unused/unneeded accommodating power the average person (with corrected eyesight) has?  I realize this will change with age, but I'm just wondering about a general range. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SL</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2002, 15:52</p><p>But S-type and tinyeyes were talking about accommodating enough to counteract -8.00 lenses.  However you term it, that's equivalent to accommodating against natural farsightedness, right?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2002, 08:05</p><p>SL: No, surely without your specs you're accommodating *plus*, not *minus* 2.5 (or whatever it was. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2002, 16:02</p><p>There is this boy in my swimming pool who is driving me crazy. With lust. He is Italian-looking, rather on the short side, say 5 ft 7, with a finely sculpted face and high cheekbones. He's slightly hairy, with terrific pecs and thick thighs: he obvously works out. His eyes are almost black, deep set, but most of the time that he's in the pool they are narrowed to slits. </p><p> </p><p>That's because he has taken his glasses off, and he can't see shit without them. His specs are beautiful: letterbox-shape, rimless at the front, but with quite heavy dark arms; the lenses are fairly flat at the front, and hi-index. I'd put him at -5, maybe a tad more. I saw him in the locker room today. He had changed into his tight lycra trunks before he reached into his bag, fished out a case and pulled off his glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>Then we were into squint city. He has this adorable way of squinting, which involves bringing down his thick black eyebrows and wrinkling his nose. He does it as he walks into the shower (though, the other day, he kept his specs on in the shower until they steamed up). In fact, he squints every time he looks at anything remotely far away. Judging by the way he held his shampoo, swimming goggles etc., he has about 8 inches' clear vision. But I very much doubt whether he spends much time bare-eyed: his expression says, "I'm blind, and I can't wait to put my specs on and get my eyesight back!"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>myoguy</b>&nbsp;23 Aug 2002, 09:10</p><p>First of all, sorry about using myoguy28.  That's my yahoo password.  I'm still myoguy.  I had my eye exam this morning and as expected there has been a change.  My new Rx is R.-16.00x-2.00 L.-16.00x-1.50. add +3.25 trifocal.  This time I'm getting blended myodiscs along with my CR39 glasses.  I'm only getting bifocals in the myo's this time.  Trifocals in the other glasses.  I hope this is the last change.  If you add the cylynder along with the sphere I'm getting very close to that -20 mark which I hope to avoid.  I like wearing glasses, but mine are already strong and thick enough.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2002, 19:00</p><p>myoguy28, </p><p> </p><p>Looking back at the postings this thread, got my answer to the "28" question.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2002, 12:58</p><p>myoguy28, -14 and other Hi Rx Guys </p><p> </p><p>First, notice myoguy is now myoguy28.  Were there two myoguys before or does the 28 have special meaning? </p><p> </p><p>Just returned from shopping at large discount store called Costco, not sure how widespread this chain is.  Anyway, a guy behind us(male partner), had only 1 item and since no express line we let him go in front of us which put him at the front of the line.  Sort of a character so chatted a bit but the glasses are what caught my eye and it did not seem approriate to broach that subject.  Gold frames nothing too exciting about them but the lenses were myos and I could not keep from looking at them. Would love to know the Rx. I thought the idea of myos was to decrease the thickines.  One of his was almost a half inch thick and the other a bit less.  Not knowing all that much, not sure if blended or not.  Did notice when he took bills out of his wallet he had to hold them close to see the denominations.  Would appreciate comments about thickness of myodiscs.   </p><p> </p><p>Also, still not sure at what point the myos become necessary or is just up to the individual?  Seems like the guy with almost -20 is not wearing myos. </p><p> </p><p>-14, thanks for goggle info.  Some years ago I had some -6 Speedos and they immediately became scratched and not very useful.  Since I mostly do casual swimming, head above water, my sunglasses work fine or old regular glasses for an indoor pool.  Have you investigated the Rx goggles one obtqains from an Optician?  I know Speedos would not go to a very high Rx.  Also thanks for the thickness info.  Have to get a mm ruler so I know better about that.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>myoguy28</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2002, 05:14</p><p>I swim regularly and wear my regular -CR-39 glasses with large swim goggles over them. I wish it were possible to get swim goggles with a Rx similar to mine, however I know that will never happen since there aren't a lot of people with as high an Rx as mine.  I guess I've been "dethroned" as the highest myope on this thread. Welcome Oelijs.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;21 Aug 2002, 19:47</p><p>Tommy </p><p> </p><p>You can probably find a pair of -6 speedo goggles on EBAY for around $5US. I think they are $25.00 retail. </p><p> </p><p>My bifocal add is +2.00 so reading glasses would be -12.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;21 Aug 2002, 19:25</p><p>Tommy (Hi oeli!! your still queen of the myopes) </p><p> </p><p>my regular glasses are high index bifocals and are 10mm thick. my sunnies are cr-39s and are 15mm. for swimming i either wear an old pair of glasses or some -8 speedo swim goggles which leave me undercorrected but it's better than bare eyed.</p><p></p><hr>

I am USA, eastern Pennsylvania. </p><p> </p><p>I have heard that the Zeiss hi-index are the best and most expensive.  What type of frames do you wear and how thick are your basic lenses?  What is your Rx for the reading glasses?  I think you said they are hi-index also.  I recall someone who apparently had hi-index for regular glasses and regular for sunglasses which were very thick compared to his regular glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for info. on your quick progression.  Beyond -20 is myodisc the only alternative?  Seems like myodisc has a lower Rx than yours, perhaps he does not know about the Zeiss lenses? </p><p> </p><p>Enjoying the postings of the high Rx guys, assume all may be male oriented in interest. </p><p> </p><p>I am currently wearing Polo Ralph Lauren frames in a yellow tortise, the large retro look, now back in style.  Works OK with my -6, hi-index progressives, lots of room for the mid-range and reading portions and lenses extend just a bit behind the frame.  My sunglasses are a tortise Georgio Armani frame, no longer made.  Have hi-index flat top bifocals but can't use them for driving as I cannot see the dash instrument controls, like speedometer.  Guess I should get progressive sunglasses but these darn things cost so much.  I wear the sunglasses mostly for swimming as I can't see anything and do not have Rx goggles.  What do you guys do for swimming?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;21 Aug 2002, 07:37</p><p>Tommy </p><p> </p><p>my bifocals are flat top and if i get trifocals i'll get the same. the bifocal segment of my present glasses is 10mm so i can just imagine how small it would be if i had trifocals. </p><p>just like myoguy i had some pretty big RX increases in my late teens. i went from -10 to -14 in a little less than 3 years.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>myoguy</b>&nbsp;21 Aug 2002, 04:54</p><p>Tommy &amp; -14 </p><p> </p><p>Let's see if I can remember all your questions.  My cr39 glasses are a little over 1/2 inch thick.  At least half of the thickness sticks out in front of the frame.  The trifocals are 36mm and flat top.  No, I've never tried progressives.  Very happy with flat tops.  The trifocal segments in the myo's are quite small which does make close work with them for a long period of time difficult.They're good enough to read something like a menu, however, which I couldn't do if I wore single vision myo's.  My computer bifocal glasses have my mid Rx on top and my bottom Rx in the bifocal.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2002, 20:09</p><p>myoguy and -14 </p><p> </p><p>myoguy, you mentioned computer bifocal glasses.  What is the Rx for those?  Assume it would be less than your regular non-myo trifocals, speaking of which did you try progressives?  Perhaps not, since you apparently had regular bifocals from an early age.  My regular glasses are expensive type of progressives which I have had for many years with minor Rx change.  I have been very satisfied with these.  My computer glasses are flat top bifocals, large bottom but not executive.  I find them very useful at the computer.  The top is for the screen and bottom for the desk work.  The Rx is about 1 diopter less in top and bottom from my regular Rx of R-5.25, L-6.25, with +2.50. </p><p> </p><p>-14, are your bifocals progressive?  Will you consider progressivs for the trifocals?  Met a guy at a party recently who has high minus, about 10 I would guess.  Had small gold frames with regular trifocals; top and middle looked right size but the bottom was so tiny I could not imagine what he could see when looking thru that area.  Perhaps that is what it is like with myo bifocals and trifocals.  Did you say you also had myos like myoguy?  Did you have quick progression like myoguy had at one period? </p><p> </p><p>Enjoyed reading posts from both of you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2002, 09:47</p><p>myoguy </p><p> </p><p>i will probably give trifocals a try at my next exam. i thought about it this time but decided to start with the bifocals. my bifocal lenses have a slight BC but s/v i have plano and biconcave. one pair of cr-39s is very thick (18mm) was wondering what size the bowls were on your myodiscs and are they non-blended?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>myoguy</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2002, 09:29</p><p>-14 </p><p> </p><p>Yes, our Rx looks rather similar.  Things might be a little blurry for me with your glasses, however.  You ought to give trifocals a try.  I find them very helpful.  My Dr. has his own lab so he orders whatever type of lenses he feels appropriate.  I got myo's two years ago when I had my last Rx change.  I have my six month appt. on Friday and I will probably have to have a slight increase.  I was warned the last time that this might happen.  The trifocals in myo's are similar to regular glasses except that the area is smaller, which can be a problem.  I have bifocals that I wear for extended intermediate and close work, like at the computer.  And I have regular plastic lenses with plano base.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2002, 09:15</p><p>myoguy </p><p> </p><p>looks like we could wear each others glasses altho yours are a bit stronger. my rx is -14.25 X -2.00/-14.00 X -1.50 with a +2.00 add. got my first bifocals a couple of months ago. eye doc tried to get me in trifocals in my teens but i resisted. i have some blended myodiscs but single vision. when did you first get myodiscs and can you explain how trifocals work with them? most opticians where i live (east coast US) don't want to be bothered with myodiscs. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>myoguy</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2002, 05:40</p><p>Tommy &amp; Tinyeyes </p><p> </p><p>I don't recall what Rx was when I got my first glasses in 1st grade.  The only thing I remember is that I couldn't see the blackboard and the teacher called my parents.  A week later I had bifocal glasses.  The most rapid change came when I was a sophomore in HS.  Had to have three changes in one year.  Went from a -7 to a -10.25 in one year.  Also went to trifocals on the second Rx change.  The doctor thought I might end up wearing over a -20 Rx.  It's been two years since I have had to get new glasses.  I have a checkup every six months.  My next appt. is on Friday.  At my last appt. the doctor said I would probably have to have a small bump up in strength, and I can tell that's probably going to happen.  Things have leveled off but I'm probably going to end up by the time I'm 30 right around that -20 mark, perhaps a little less. I like wearing myo's because they are lighter and I actually seem to be able to see a little better.  I check out at 20/20 with both glasses, but with the myo's it's a little easier. I'm probably really closer to 20/30 with my regular glasses. However I don't like the myo's for driving because there is no peripheral vision.  Usually wear my regular glasses then.  My partner (boy type) really likes me in the myo's so I wear them most of the time when we are together.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2002, 22:55</p><p>Myoguy, that's quite a prescription you have!  Must be interesting going through life with that prescription and the lenses that correct it.  Do you ever wear contacts? I'm about -8 which I think is quite myopic but you are wayyyy beyond that!  I'd like to talk to you more....email me at tinyeyes@hotmail.com.  </p><p> </p><p>I liked the grocery store sightings, Scott. I will try to post more.  I am working in a new neighborhood (near a large university) that seems to have more cute guys in glasses.  Saw a nice looking guy in his 20s today at a fast food place, wearing stylish high indexers that were at least -7. Nice! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2002, 20:29</p><p>myoguy, </p><p> </p><p>Took a look at your Rx to see how myopic you are.  Yes, very strong but if you see OK with the various glasses that't great.  The bifocals at an early age were probably thought to slow progression.  Assume your minus power was high even then.  Did getting stronger glasses frequently bother you? Are you still having changes?  Did you go to myo so as to minimize thickness? </p><p>I am learning about this thru eyescene. My Rx is about minus 6, quite a difference from yours.  Do people ask you about your strong glasses, especially the myo's?  </p><p></p><hr>

But I think he's a cutie anyway, even though he's on "that team" (aka the Braves; I'm a long-suffering Phils fan ;-))</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Scott</b>&nbsp;18 Aug 2002, 12:26</p><p>Two interesting sightings while at the supermarket the other day.  The first was a very good looking guy,mid 30's, with medium brown hair and neatly trimmed beard to match. Slender, medium height with rectanuglar metal frames holding lenses I would guess about a -6 or more.  The lenses were noticeably thick edge.  And then came along another good looking guy, probably mid 20's, dark hair, slender build wearing plus lenses in a round frame.  I would say of moderate strength with bifocals. Dressed in nice fitting Levi's and a t-shirt.  When I was in the checkout lane I looked behind me and there was the guy with the minus lenses.  He started talking with me and we had a nice, although brief, conversation.  He lives not far from me.  Perhaps we will meet again.  Would be nice!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>toby</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2002, 09:10</p><p> </p><p>Thanks to several of you for the info on Singa's Guy.  Would still like more info on him--like how old he is and what his actual RX (without GOC) is. </p><p> </p><p>In the summers, the University for which I work hosts a series of 10-day orientation progrms for international high school students who are being sent all over the U.S. to spend a year attending high school and living with  host families.  Most of them are Scandinavians, Germans, Dutch, and Danish.  The boys are beautiful!  Almost all are blond, with beautiful complexions and beautiful bodies-- whether buff, trim, thin,or downright skinny.  And, of course, a few (too few) wear glasses.  On Thursday, I spotted three boys walking across the campus to an athletic field.  One was a very attractive Nordic guy with a very close hair cut and wearing long semi-dress pants, no shirt, and fairly strong glasses in stylish smallish frames.  He was about 5' 10" with a well-built, smoothe, hairless chest.  As he walked away, I noticed what at first I thought were tatoos all over his back (a turn-off for me), but then I concluded that someone had just written all over his back with a magic marker--so hopefully it will wash off. </p><p>It was a very sunny day.  I am particularly attracted to nearsighted guys who never wear sunglasses or clip-ons.  And, if they are bear-chested, all the better.  Well, that was my best sighting of the week!   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>toby</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2002, 22:01</p><p> </p><p>Henry: </p><p> </p><p>Well, I guess that I am only moderately short-sighted, as compared with the -5's and up (to -10's, -12's, etc.) that you guys are sighting.  But, not only do I feel very disoriented without my glasses but also I find it a turn-on to wear my glasses in situations where most people don't wear them.  (And I really do have trouble seeing the water valve controls in unfamiliar showers.)  Of course, I wouldn't think of taking a shower at a gym without my glasses--so I can see the other guys showering.  That brings back a memory from my college days:  I was in the same gym glass with a rather attractive boy from Georgia, who always showered with his glasses on.  As I recall, his lenses were not particularly thick.  I've always wondered if perhaps he was gay and just wanted to be able to see the other guys much clearer!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>henry</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2002, 16:42</p><p>Toby, wow. you are a breath of fresh air. How is it that you need your glases to shower? i thought you were moderately shorrt sighted. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Toby</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2002, 20:30</p><p>I only just stumbled upon your "Guys in Glasses" discusssion group last night, along with the "Spexyguys" Yahoo group.  I'm so happy to have found you.  I have a number of fetishes, but "guys in glasses" is one of my oldest and strongest.  Perhaps at some point I will reveal my other, more secret fetishes (one of which is guys with braces on their teeth).  I am interested in knowing whether there are a lot of us out there who have the same or similar combinations of different (but perhaps somewhat related)fetishes.  My obsession with glasses (especially on guys) probably began at about the age of 10 or younger.  As a young boy, I so wanted to have to wear glasses; but it was not until age 11 that I was diagnosed as myopic.  I began wearing mutiple lense glasses about 20 years ago--first progressive lenses for a few years.  But then the cost of progressives seemed so exorbitant that I swithed to trifocals.  But, to be honest, the real reason that I swithced was that I knew that I would get off on wearing trifocals.  I really like the look of those lines, and I'm turned on to guys who wear bifocals or trifocals.  And the "sightings" that people send in are so familiar--and so stimulating!   </p><p> </p><p>I consider myself very myopic--or now presbyopic.  My vision blurs beyond about 6 inches from my eyes.  But I suppose that, compared with others, I'm not really "blind as a bat."  I don't understand all the technicalites of lense prescriptions.  Reading from my current prescription, in  my right (and weaker)eye, the "spherical" for distance vision is -3.00, the "cylindrical is +1.25, and the axis is 105.  The left eye has slightly lower numbers for all three.  (Whatever all this means!) But I read in your postings, excitement over -5 or -8 or more. What is the prescription for flat-looking "coke bottle lenses"?  (Can someone suggest a good source, perhaps on the internet, to understand all this refraction terminology?) </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, unless a guy is exceptionally  good looking, wearing glasses is a must for me to become really attracted.  I hate contact lenses! Both my former partner and my current partner (of 17 years) are very nearsighted--more so than I.  The former wore contacts almost exclusively; my current has contacts but, thank God, he very seldom wears them.  We've never discussed my attraction to glasses; but we regularly make love both wearing our glasses.  Like someone suggested in one of your recent discussions, I want to see what we are doing.  And I love the feel of his frames between my legs. That is such a turn-on!  After all, I never, ever take my glasses off, except when I go to sleep--and then only after I have turned out the bedside light!  I shave, shower, and go swimming with my glasses on.  Why not make love with them on?    </p><p> </p><p>Well, enough of my ramblings for a first posting.  I look forward to further discussions.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2002, 19:34</p><p>Nothing exciting to report today!  Of course I am very envious of your sighting, Dom.  OK,actually I did have a nice sighting today, but it wasn't my usual sort -- a very nice looking, dark featured guy in his early 30s at the grocery store, wearing strong PLUS glasses.  Usually I'm going crazy over high minus, but this guy was so handsome and his glasses were quite strong.  I wish I knew how to estimate plus RXs, but I have to admit I know nothing about it.  All I know is his eyes were quite magnified.  If we tried each other's glasses we would each find the other's completely useless!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2002, 08:50</p><p>Wow, Dominic, what a great story. It's great when we can share our encounters. Perhaps we can get Tiny to share some of his, he seems to be on top of his game. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2002, 16:18</p><p>Good God, I MUST start reading back my messages before posting them. Apologies for all the typos. </p><p> </p><p>A sighting today: a youth with short cropped brown hair standing outside the supermarket, wearing absolute coke bottles. He must have been minus 12, and he didn't exactly conceal it - his specs were large and square, and despite a biconcave front they looked like they could have stopped bullets. I can think of someone in LA who would have adored his minuscule eyes.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2002, 16:14</p><p>I've mentioned it before, but I'll always treausre the memory of going back with a gorgeous young Finnish boy to his flat. he was so cute - longish blond hair and a cute little bum in right trousers. And as soon as we got int the door, he says "excuse me while I take out my lenses". He came back bare-eyed, put on a CD - bending over VERY close to the rack - and then we jumped into bed. In the middle of the night I got up and, on my way to pee, noticed his round gold specs on the table. A lovely strong Rx, too; I took them into the bathroom and tried them on. About minus 6 I reckon. The next morning he walked around his room without specs for quite a long time before putting them on. Sigh. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2002, 07:54</p><p>These days it seems most gay men who are nearsighted wear contacts, ESPECIALLY if their prescription is over 2 or 3 diopters.  So I have to figure out if they are wearing contacts -- which isn't easy.  I'm a lot better at spotting them than I used to be, but I have a long way to go.  Close proximity helps, and so does daylight -- I've found out daytime events are much better for this! You're not going to spot a guy's (hopefully powerful) contacts in a dark bar at midnight!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2002, 07:49</p><p>Well, I haven't exactly mastered the art -- but I have found out how difficult it can be to meet guys who are nearsighted.  Believe me, everyone I date and/or hook up with is not high minus.  But that's always the hope.  I definitely always try to go to their place, though, because if they're wearing contacts, that's where the glasses will be. It can be very frustrating -- guys with other fetishes or interests seem to be able to find who they want easily through the internet -- but not us!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2002, 10:03</p><p>Wow, Tiny- looks like you're the expert. </p><p> </p><p>I can see how it would be easier to bring up the subject with a steady boyfriend, but sounds like you've mastered the art even with a trick. </p><p> </p><p>Do you always go back to their place, so that their glasses are nearby? It sounds like you have a system, especially if all your encounters are with high minus guys. I don't seem to find that many, and the guys out in the clubs don't seem to wear their glasses. </p><p> </p><p>How do you do it?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2002, 22:57</p><p>In my life I had only one time the chance to make love with a gay guy in glases, thats was in Thailand 2 years before. I meet him in the street and when I saw him I'am was fascinated because he wear glasses and he was a Thaiboy about 19 y.o. with a very good body and very handsome face and the typical Thai-haircut. He wear a oval black frame with about -3 sph. both side. While walking near together I had to smile only - it's very easy in Thailand for 2 mens - and he smile back and ask me where I go. All was clear and after a 5 minutee-talk we maked a appointement. We had a nice evening together and we went to my hotel for make love. I not will write all details, however he will took off his glasses and then I ask him if he can put his glasses again and he agree with no problem. I told him, that he look very good with his glasses and I like it, when he not take off. That's all, we not talk more about this matter and myself I not take off my glasses while making love. Unfortunately I loose the adress from him, when he go in the late morning. </p><p> </p><p>Greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2002, 12:08</p><p>I have had a lot of experience with this problem, and I have found that the only way is honesty.  It used to drive me crazy that even guys who were practically blind without their glasses would take them off when lovemaking started.  Life is short.  In recent years, when I have the chance to have sex with a goodlooking, high-minus guy, I tell them I love them in glasses and ask them to wear the glasses for me-- at least part of the time.  In my experience they usually agree.   Some guys laugh that I would want that, but oh well, that's who I am and life is too short to keep tiptoeing around it!  A couple of times I've even successfully gotten a guy to take out his contacts and put his glasses on for me!  One guy even said he was glad I asked because his contacts were irritating and he was wearing them only because he thought I would not want to have sex with him in glasses!   (These are guys who are nearsighted enough that they really need corrective lenses to see during lovemaking --- unless they just prefer to close their eyes the whole time!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2002, 19:44</p><p>Here's another question- I'm a guy who likes guys in glasses as well- Do you ever have sex with guys in their glasses? If so, how do you get them to keep their glasses on without scaring them off?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>henry</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2002, 12:41</p><p>Thanks Lore and Julian for your sound advice</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2002, 00:25</p><p>Years ago I remember a colleague coming to me at the lunch break at a meeting and saying, "Julian, I love your glasses; where did you get them?" I was wearing black metal aviators (that shows how long ago it was; they were the 'in' thing) by Silhouette, which had cost an arm and a leg at Dollond &amp; Aitchison. Obviously we chatted about them, but I'm pretty sure he didn't try them on - he certainly wouldn't have seen much as he was pretty myopic and my lenses are low plus (he was in black plastic frames which looked good on him). Anyway, I was quite flattered. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2002, 20:18</p><p>I don't think anything more than "Nice frames" or "I like your glasses" is needed, if you want to talk to someone about their glasses.  You will probably just get a "Thanks," or maybe a "Thanks, I got them at _____," which might be disappointing, if you really want them to talk about them.  If that's the case, I'd suggest (and this is totally off the top of my head: I'm just thinking of what I might ask someone, or what I wouldn't mind being asked) complimenting them of their frames, and then asking if you can try them on, to see what the frames look like on you, because you were thinking of getting glasses like that.  At that point, the person will probably, if they don't mind you trying them on, make some sort of further comment about them: "They're really strong," "You won't be able to see much with them," etc.  Then you can ask questions if you want.  But, and this is JMHO, if you really want to talk to someone about their glasses, start with a compliment, and don't make any mention of them being strong/thick until the person wearing them does first.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>henry</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2002, 16:56</p><p>Sorry Lore. I would not wont to offend anybody. Perhaps "nice frames" etc. is the best way. Any more ideas. Henry</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2002, 15:47</p><p>Just to clarify from my last post: I don't want to make it sound like people are asking every day to try on my glasses.  They aren't.  No one's asked in like five or six years.  But when I was living in a dorm, people would sometimes try on one another's glasses, and that's what I was talking about. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2002, 15:46</p><p>Henry, </p><p> </p><p>Not sure if you were serious, but that just seems like a really, really good way to embarass someone.  I know that, if someone said that to me (I'm a girl, but I doubt a guy would react much differently), I'd 1) think they were an idiot and 2) be quite self-conscious, and both factors would make me want to get away from that person as soon as I could.   I'd definitely try another approach, more along the lines of "nice frames." </p><p> </p><p>If you really want to try on someone's glasses, saying that you like the frame and want to see how it would look on you (assuming there's a mirror nearby) is the best idea.  I know that when people say that to me, I don't mind letting them try my glasses on.  But, if they ask to try them on in the context of talking about how strong my glasses are, I usually don't let them try them on; I'll just say, "No, I really need them, and you won't be able to see anything with them."  So, if you want to try on someone's glasses, don't try to do it by mentioning how strong or thick they are, at least not if you want that person to like you :).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>henry</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2002, 10:35</p><p>A good way to start a conversation about someones glasses ,that are quite thick, is to pretend that you thimk that the lenses are coming out of the frame. The wearer then explains that he is as blind as a bat and you can swop specs etc</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2002, 12:42</p><p>I had a good sighting this morning, once again at the gym where I work out...it's a good place for them!  I was in the locker room and as I going into the bathroom I noticed a tall, hunky, tan, blondish guy standing at the sink, wearing what seemed to be strong minus glasses!  When I came out of the bathroom to wash my hands, he was still by the sink, but the glasses weren't on his face! Instead, he was putting in his contacts, and (this is a new one for me) holding his glasses in his mouth by the earpiece as he did so!  It was pretty awkward looking, but I could see the power rings in his black frame, rectangular glasses as they hung from his mouth. I was washing my hands right next to him, so I asked, "Can I hold those for you?"  He laughed and said, "Oh, I'm used to doing this. I looked into Lasik but I don't feel comfortable doing it [or something like that he said] and so it's contacts for me!"  </p><p> </p><p>I told him I liked the glasses, and he said "Oh, they're old, but I'm thinking about getting new lenses put into the old frames."  I suppose he had both contacts in by now, but I decided to be bold and asked "Put them on!"  And he did!  But only for a moment....I would guess he was about a -7.  Amazing!  We exchanged a couple more pleasantries and then I was on my way, but I thought of an excuse to walk by him one more time and flirt a little. He was about to take a shower after working out, and he put his contacts in BEFORE the shower--can't blame him for that with his highly myopic eyes!  This hunky (although slightly effeminate) good looking guy is someone I've probably seen before, but never really noticed in the sea of hunky guys at that gym, until I realized he's blind as a bat!  I'll definitely be watching for him now! Strong muscles and strong lenses--what a wonderful combination!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2002, 22:10</p><p>OK, I volunteer for this fundraiser in Philadelphia called "Gay Bingo." As a volunteer monthly I do various things. Well, I see this one guy, who was heterosexual sit down wearing glasses, and they seemed to distort a bit, so I walked up, making sure he wasn't watching and saw astigmatism and visible bifocals. He's in his mid 20's I assume. </p><p> </p><p>I later came up to the table where he and his girlfriend were sitting as they were with a group from a store that sponsored a game. I asked if anyone there worked for the store. He said he did. I noticed he probably was nearsighted with more astigmatism than nearsightedness, but definitely bifocals. Someone threw a CD-Rom from the balcony at the table where I was with them and we caught them and I asked what it was due to it's odd shape. They said it was a CD. On the other side of the CD was small writing, so he tilts his head up to read through the bottom of the lense, which was so cute. He also extended the CD out a bit to read it. Do bifocals magnify so much that that's necessary? Very friendly guy and his girlfriend. I took a photo which I will have made into disk film and email it to them. Do I dare I ask him about his bifocals or would it be rude? </p><p> </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2002, 03:58</p><p>I totally agree: the barber's shop is a great place for sightings. I often think of this gorgeous hunky boy, with blond curly hair, who sat next to me a couple of years ago. He wore gold semi-rimless specs with a solid -5 Rx, and it was obvious he couldn't see too much once they came off. The barber kept asking him questions about how much he wanted cut off, and so the kid had to keep leaning forward and reaching for his glasses so he could see what he was talking about.I think he was a bit embarrassed.He looked like a rubgy player to me, with his huge thighs and big feet  but that's one sport you can't play in glasses. Anyway, the whole thing was a turn on, not least because the boy's specs were folded right next to me, displaying rows and rows of lovely white rings. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Del</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2002, 22:24</p><p>A great place to observe guys with their glasses is the barber shop/hair stylist because they have to take their glasses off to get their haircut, but often have to put them back on to see in the mirror. The problem is, I can't really see what's going on myself because my glasses are off during my haircut. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gavin</b>&nbsp;31 May 2002, 09:29</p><p>What really turns me on are teenage boys with very strong positive lenses. It does not matter how fashionable the frames are, the lenses are the only thing you see. An imperfection on a perfect face.</p><p></p><hr>

And he wear glasses, however I think he see not bad and he arrange all for the other people staying near him. He wear very strong bifocalplusglasses (I guess 15 to 20 sph.) in a middlesized silver aviator frame with sporting earpieces (so called imperialearpieces) He look also very handsome with this strong glasses and he was verya funny, because he joke all the time with his friends and one time he touch me with his hand while speaking with his friends and he turn back to me and spook: Sorry, I not see you, because I have some problems with my eyes. I not wish for him, that he must wear this strong glasses, however for me that's was a very nice sighting and it seems, that he not was unhappy.  </p><p> </p><p>Greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;29 May 2002, 17:45</p><p>tinyeyes, </p><p> </p><p>Enjoyed reading your 2 WEHO sightings. </p><p>Those Rx's may be stronger than you think.  With those small rimless and metal frames the thickness is minimized for a high minus.  Conversation might be easier if you are wearing your glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Only thing to report from the East is a young male worker in the local market with rather ordinary rectangular gold metal frames with thick lenses extending beyond the frame in back, probably a minus 5 or 6.  Caught him looking in the distance to get another employees attention and he was squinting behind those lenses, just a quick squint but I noticed.  Would suppose he is in need of an exam followed by an increase in his minus.  It's a nearby market so will be on the lookout for him. No chance for conversation at the first sighting. </p><p> </p><p>I think best place for posting these sightings is in this thread. </p><p> </p><p>Tommy  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;29 May 2002, 12:35</p><p>Couple of sightings...didn't get to speak to these guys unfortunately. Yesterday I spotted a guy at the coffee place (gay neighborhood) as I walked by...he was inside but walked outside to sit.  I loitered for a couple of minutes to get a look at him....not my usual type...but very good looking....he was the hunky, tan, dark haired West Hollywood type...thirties....very muscular.  Kind of "out of my league"....certainly not the type you expect to be in "real" glasses, but there we was, reading the paper.  He had rimless ovals, and those edges were mega thick!  I spotted the cut in and minification through the window before he came outside.  </p><p>Rimless glasses bother me because they always look stronger than they are, but I'd say he was at least -5 (but at first glance the thick rimless edges made him look a -8 or -9!)  I'm sure he had to beg to get the rimless frames, or else had an unknowing optical dispenser that didn't realize how thick they would come out.  Very nice!   </p><p> </p><p>Then today I went to the bank, also in the gay part of town... there was a guy standing at the teller window that I noticed from behind as I walked in.  Tall slim but muscular, wearing a tank top and definitely a gay look, dark hair and a baseball cap.  He looked very cute from behind.  It wasn't until I walked over to get in line that I realized he had spex on!  Wow...a bonus because I already thought he looked great.  THEN, I realized that the entire bank was captured in his lenses (from behind!) I waited for him to finish up and turn around to walk away, and was treated to a VERY quick view of this hot guy, another tan "WeHo" type, but yet with amazingly powerful spex on!  I got a very quick look, but they were dark wire ovals, small, NOT rimless (this guy was beyond the rimless option)....and plenty of cut in. He had to be at least -6 or -7, but easily could have been an 8 or 9.  WOW!  I tried to follow (I know I'm shameless) but he headed away from the bank quickly on foot.  He never noticed my presence at all. I'm not really on the radar of those model WeHo types.  Usually I don't care, but suddenly it seems more of these guys are high myopes than I realized!  I'm sure both of these guys are heavy contact users...I was just lucky enough to catch both of them on a before-noon, glasses day.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;27 May 2002, 21:59</p><p>Thanks Tommy....yes it was a fun experience for me and a real turn on as well (I didn't want to be too graphic on this list).  I don't see that guy every day, but if I see him again I will be chatting with him.  Maybe I'll be wearing my glasses next time, but chances are he won't be.  I think his glasses were high-index, but not as high as mine, so they were a little thicker.  I suppose I could have told him that he could get glasses significantly thinner with a slightly smaller frame and higher index material -- but I love the way he looks in the ones he has!!!  His glasses looked like they were probably at least a couple of years old and are mainly for backup since he is a dedicated contact lens guy (and with my similar Rx, I can't say I blame him....vision is compromised in glasses when you're a -9!)  </p><p></p><hr>

Must have been great in person. </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps the guys lenses are thicker due to being non-hi index?  How do they compare to your -8's, are they hi index? </p><p> </p><p>Sounds as though gym guy might be interested in discussing optics.

I would recommend Ethan Hawke's surprisingly good (and straight, of course) novel the Hottest State, which is about a 21 year-old actor who wears contacts and glasses and can't see a damned thing without them. Lots of good myopic detail - as you'd expect, coming from nearsighted Ethan.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;05 May 2002, 19:45</p><p>Allan, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for your response on question about threads.  Am learning more about where to post what.  Will post this information here though since this is where our questions and answers started. </p><p> </p><p>I will comment on some things in your post of May 2 and the one of May 5. </p><p> </p><p>Where did you pick up all your optical expertise?  Reread your post of 5/2 and some still does not sink in. </p><p> </p><p>My Rx has not changed much since early 20's, many years ago.  Only have Rx copies from 1997, wish I had saved the earlier ones but they are gone.  From 1997, highest the L has gone is -6.00 in '99 and the lowest -5.25, which is current.  The highest R -7.00 also in '99 and the lowest R-6.25, which is current.  Don't recall what happened on 1999, different drops, no drops??  Had the same opthamologist for past 30+ years, he retired end of 2001 and changing will be tough for me.  Next exam due about Nov. this year.  </p><p> </p><p>Since '97, cylinder both eyes stayed about +200, don't recall anything earlier about change.  Axis '97 L 17,  </p><p>R 2, in '00 was L 17, R 178, which is current.  Last exam 11/9/01. </p><p> </p><p>Computer glasses are from '98 but very close to current Rx of '01 which I did not have filled.  L -4.25, R -5.25, +1.75 for bifocal.  These are regular flat-top bifocals with a large bottom but not executive.  The only difference in the new Rx is the L which is -4.50.  </p><p> </p><p>I also have bifocal sunglasses with an Rx of a few years ago, similiar, with a regular size bifocal bottom.  The problem with these is when I tried using them for driving I could not see the control panel in the car.  So, I really need a pair of progressive sunglasses and have put it off due to expense.  I don't want to start trifocals and they would be expensive also.  I told you before that my regular Rx is -5.25 L and </p><p>- 6.25 R and I have had progressive lenses for years. </p><p> </p><p>It's good you had that short experience with bifocals but sounds as though your myopia has not progressed at a rapid rate so the Dr. may have over reacted. </p><p> </p><p>When you need bifocals, way in the future probably, progressives are the way to go in my opinion, they are much better than years ago.  You can see the mid-range and avoid trifocals. </p><p> </p><p>That's a lot but you helped me and these are my best answers to your previous questions.  Don't recall if you commented on your lenses, thick or thin? </p><p> </p><p>There is a discussion going in another thread about wearers of glasses being attracted to other wearers.  Would like you to read and join in. Thanks, </p><p> </p><p>Tommy </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;05 May 2002, 16:53</p><p>Tommy, </p><p>  </p><p>The stuff we're talking about seems to belong either in the Acuity and Prescription (II) thread or else maybe in the Post Your Prescription thread.  The only info about these threads is their title, so we just have to judge for ourselves whether we're in the right thread...and there's no penalty for going off-topic (and it's done a lot). </p><p> </p><p>My Rx is -3.5 (both eyes, with trivial cylinder).  Basically it started when I was 14 and continued at -0.5 per year for about 6 more years...very consistent, it seems.  For the 4 years since then, my myopia hasn't changed, but I seem to be developing a significant astigmatism. </p><p> </p><p>I don't wear bifocals, so most of my experience with them is with glasses I've played around with and from reading things people write here. (And thinking about glasses/optics quite a bit.)  I did actually wear bifocals for a while when I was in high school, as my eye doc at the time thought it would slow progression, but I ended up with a new doctor before long and haven't had bifocals since then.   </p><p> </p><p>You could get a stronger than +2.5 reading add (or equivalent base prescription).  It seems like you like to hold things pretty close to your eyes (at more than -5), so a +3 or more add strikes me as a good idea.  I think you should be able to tell your eye doctor that you want to be able to see things closer up without taking your glasses off.  The stronger add should be an option. </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;02 May 2002, 08:28</p><p>Alan, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for quick response.  Need some time to read again and will get back to you.  Sounds as though you have an optical background. </p><p> </p><p>What is your Rx and experience with bifocal/trifocal/progressive lenses.  How did your myopia progress and do you have thick or thin lenses.  Davidminus20 said if one likes thick lenses and most clear sight that plastic CR39 is the way to go.  I recall an early progressive that I absoluty could not wear and had to use regular bifocals.  In recent years the progressives are much better.  I can see to read but easier if off and hold things closer.  Am wondering if the plus on the progressives should be more than +2.50? Will elaborate on computer glasses later and earlier experiences.  Assume you read in my posting about the 5th grade weak Rx and much stronger a couple years later.  Should have had a exam in a year but did not realize how much I was not seeing.  Guess that happens a lot. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;02 May 2002, 07:04</p><p>Tommy, </p><p>   This probably isn't the best thread for this, but the cylinder and axis in your prescription correct for astigmatism.  Basically, your glasses have more power in one axis than in the other (90 degrees off) axis...because your eyes have more power in one axis than the other.  "Cylinder" is called that because the shape of a lens with just cylinder power is more like the outside of a cylinder rather than a sphere.  Cylinder doesn't exactly make your prescription "stronger"; it's a different type of correction than the first number (the spherical correction). But the way your prescription is writen, it's probably reasonable to say that if you just left off the cylinder numbers (and left the sphere the same) then the new prescription would be "stronger" than yours.   I mean, a mildly myopic person would probably see better with your glasses than with glasses that were -5.25/-6.25 with no cylinder; this is because the Rx is written with "+" cylinder.  There is an equivalent prescription that can be written with "-" cylinder -- it would be something like -3.25 -2 axis 107 ; -4.25 -2 axis 88. </p><p>  Are your computer glasses bifocals or single vision?  Can you use them for reading?  You might want to get tri-focals - this way you have a segment for distance, a segment for seeing things a few feet away, and a segment for reading.  Otherwise, for reading you'd want a pair with maybe 1 less diopter than your computer glasses, or about +3 or +3.5 compared to your distance glasses, given that your regular +2.5 bifocals are not enough for reading. </p><p>  Do you know when your prescription stopped changing?  And do you remember if you always had the cylinder (astigmatism) correction, or if that increased gradually during a certain period? </p><p> </p><p>Alan  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;02 May 2002, 05:35</p><p>Many of the Guys in Glasses postings, especially earlier ones, really turned me on.  I am always watchful of guys with higher Rx and if high minus get very interested.  If possible try to engage in conversation about nice frames etc. then lead into the actual prescription, type of lenses, progression of myopia etc. Most often guys are interested in this exhange of information.  My Rx and other data are in a previous posting.  Wondering why postings seem to have dropped off and no response to mine of a few days ago. Would like to hear from some of you guys. </p><p>This is new for me and I like it.  Have also looked at some other sites.  Perhaps interest in sites has changed? </p><p> </p><p>Tommy </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2002, 21:19</p><p>Worn glasses since 5th grade, teacher reported I could not see chalkboard.  Surprise visit to eye Dr. and soon had mild -Rx, do not recall.  Hardly wore since self-consious but by 7th grade I asked for another Dr. appt. since things quite blurred.  Got much stronger Rx and wore glasses all the time. </p><p>Rx increased over years to o.d. -5.25 +200 17, o.s. -6.25 +200 178 +2.50 (little change for several years). </p><p>Also have Rx for computer glasses - 4.25 </p><p>-5.25 +1.75.  Should probably use these for reading as I constantly take my regular glasses off for reading and back on for looking a few feet away.   They are expensive progressive lenses and are fine for most of the time.  When first had bifocals, regular flat-top, and earlier progressives do not recall taking them off to read.  Now somewhat of a bother since without glasses have to hold reading matter quite close.  Perhaps I should get reading glasses but what Rx and with or without bifocal?  Anyone else have this problem?  Would appreciate comments.  Also, not sure what is meant by the cylinder and axis on Rx.  Do they increase the strength of - or + Rx. </p><p>Thanks for listening and any comments.</p><p></p><hr>

Anway, I was shown to my seat by the most delightful fresh-faced guy  about 17, pink cheeks, neatly combed brown hair and really thick minus glasses: definitely on the verge of double digits. The lenses were flat-fronted or even maybe a tiny bit biconcave, but they bulged out of the plain oval metal frame and the cut-in was substantial. I wondered whether the kid would have been able to do his job as an usher if he broke his glasses - but the answer was obviously no.

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2002, 10:02</p><p>I have dated guys with no prescriptions and low prescriptions.  I admit the higher prescriptions are MUCH more appealing to me and I am much more likely to try to get to know someone if I know they have a high minus prescription. Maybe this is bad and maybe I am depriving myself.  With the guy that I described in the last post, I had seen him before and thought he was kind of cute (having no idea if he wore glasses or not) but probably there was not enough there for me to seek him out.  Seeing him in the strong glasses put me over the top. Now if I see him again I will almost certainly try to chat with him (even though he will probably be back in contacts.)  What can I say...it's my weakness....it's my fetish...it's why I'm here!  I am a highly myopic gay guy and I'm attracted to the same!  </p><p></p><hr>

He said Hi to me so I told him I liked his frames...he told me got them at L.A. Eyeworks.  Very hip....too bad (for me anyway) his RX was only low minus.  Then I was leaving on the street I saw another guy....cute skinny blond guy with goatee who I've seen before many times and noticed, but never in glasses! Today he had on rectangular wire rims that were packing at least -8 diopters. Wow!  He said hello to me too.

It always has been there and it always will be. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Martin</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2002, 16:25</p><p>It would be a lie if I said that I have never taken a double take on a guy wearing specs, but I have been really spoilt recently. </p><p> </p><p>Perhaps this note should go in "sightings" but I'm here and I'm queer as they say. </p><p> </p><p>I was working at an outside event recently and had the chance to zoom in on various groups of spectators (I'm a cameraman)and this time my high powered Canon optics landed on a guy with glasses. I did a double take but had to change subject to avoid favouritism. </p><p> </p><p>I handed over to another cameraman and climbed down from the gallery to go and find my random subject. </p><p> </p><p>This was to be the second time recently that I have sighted a teenage guy with very strong minus glasses. I am just wondering whether sometimes ones eyes change in adolescence and guys are prescribed low index lenses as they are probably cheaper, to await further changes in early adulthood and hense a progression to high indexs and/or contacts. </p><p> </p><p>In any case, the "vision" this day was stupendous !</p><p></p><hr>

Didn't know whether i should wear them all the time as no guidance from the eye doc. </p><p> </p><p>I spent that last few weeks experimenting.  Must admit i quite like the idea of me in glasses and I think that this is a really cool prescription because it means I can wear them and look like i need them but if i take them off i can still see some!  I hope it stays like that and i don't get everso nearsighted.  I got loadsa comments when i first got thse glasses.  I dont need to but i'm wearing them right now. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Was it like he was wearing 2 pairs of glasses? So you figure his prescription was -30.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jo</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2001, 22:06</p><p>Hi all... happy new year. </p><p> </p><p>Spent my Christmas in Hong Kong, and wow! Guys with thick, I mean reall think glasses every where...-8 was the norm, but it's really not difficult to see double digits minuses on the street.  </p><p>There was one middle age man, pretty attractive, with this pair of glasses with double pairs of lenses. each pair of lens is at least -15 and i should think the optician probably could not produce lenses to that power and had to make them double..very cool. </p><p>Probably because of the cold weather and the dry air, all the guys ditched their contacts and emaerged with their glasses.. a fetish heaven for me indeed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2001, 18:43</p><p>Have you ever seen a guy who was so attractive to you, your heart was pounding?  It happened to me today.  I was at the food market, which was really busy with everyone getting their New Years Eve fancy stuff, and I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw a certain young gentleman, maybe late 20s and VERY cute....fair skinned, medium height, probably gay but who knows, light brown hair cut very short, almost a Ben Affleck lookalike with shorter hair.  Except for one very important detail --- I dont think Affleck wears coke-bottle glasses with a double digit minus prescription!!  I maneuvered to get in line behind him.  He had glasses that were so exquisite I think they rank in the top ten of spexy guys Ive ever seen.  Small stylish plastic frames, in that sort of shape that is somehow oval and geometrically rectangular at the same time, black in color, but with edges that were very light pearlescent in tone -- which produced the visual effect of lens edges, but thats not what I was seeing.  Stuffed into them were his flat-fronted lenses, obviously very high-index but still showing their polished edges behind the plastic frames.  The few times when I was able to see a frontal view (instead of a side view or seeing him from behind) I could see that at least a third of the real estate of the lens was taken by cut-in, the rest by an extremely  minified blue eye. At least I think his eyes were blue --- they were so shrunken by his super-powerful glasses it was hard to tell!  Viewed from the side, the image of his eyes in those plano front lenses seemed painted on -- because the huge naked eye was clearly visible. This extremely nearsighted boy seemed to see very well with his glasses --- he never squinted, even when peering at the total on the cash register.  He was involved in a conversation with the woman next to him about film-making, from which I gathered that his name was James.  James, my tiny-eyed dream guy. I hope I see you again!!</p><p></p><hr>

I'm about a -8 and if you add in my astigmatism that makes me about a -10. I particularly like guys with a minus prescription, but a good looking guy with a plus is also nice.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;17 Dec 2001, 14:36</p><p>Russell, you're so right about the minus five to six range. Nice cut-in; good minimisation, but if the guy's eyes are his best feature they don't just disappear. (Sorry, Tiny!)  </p><p> </p><p>I've got my own peculiarity, which is that I get a big kick out of seeing myopic guys take off their glasses: I just adore the squinting and holding things close. The other day a good-looking Thai guy who works in my office (he's big and hunky, unusually for an oriental) decided that his eyes were tired and he took off his -6/7 oval specs. So for the next few minutes he kept lowering his head to the table to read things: he didn't mind his colleagues seeing how blind he was. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>roger</b>&nbsp;17 Dec 2001, 12:06</p><p>I feel just the same Russell glad I not the only one, so pleased this subject has come up otherwise the site seemed so hetrosexual.Ilike good looking guys in plus or minus Rx but like you the minus really fascinates me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;17 Dec 2001, 09:45</p><p>It's well known around here that I am a gay man who loves men in glasses.  I love to stare at men in other cars or at bus stops or when shopping.  Sometimes they notice me and then I have to turn away.  I like any kind of glasses but I am partial to minus lenses in the five to six range.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2001, 23:49</p><p>Well, yes, anybody who's been on EyeScene in any of its versions in the last (is it?) four years knows I'm into guys in glasses. I'm a gay guy aged - might as well admit it - 62. Any spexy guy interests me, and if his Rx is weak I reckon he's doing me a favour by wearing his specs when he could get along without them! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2001, 17:20</p><p>I'm thrilled this new thread is here....please post if you're into guys with glasses!  As for me, I'm a gay guy age 34 with a -9 RX, and I am obsessed with attractive guys who have high minus RXs like mine, or higher!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ANON</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2001, 14:26</p><p>SOME GUYS IN GLASSES ARE *QUITE* SEXY - DEPNDS ON WHAT THEY WEAR. I PREFER + RX - THEY'RE BEST ON AN ALREADY HANDSOME GUY, IF YOU'RE NOT A HUNK AND YOU WEAR GLASSES - WELL, SORRY IT AIN'T GONNA MAKE YA BETTER!</p><p></p><hr>
