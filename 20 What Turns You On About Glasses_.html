<p><b>gerry</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2017, 07:15</p><p>I hope this lady reads this. I was in touch with a lady from sheffield who work in social care for the elderly. She had very strong thick minus glasses, had a lovely face and beautiful hair. we lost touch i hope we can reconnect, in my eyes she was so attractive and beautiful. I think of you often please get in touch.arnoldmartinjock@hotmail.comLook forward in anticipation to your reply. Hugs XX</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>iStruggles</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2017, 22:48</p><p>I prefer a lady who does not her glasses.  The struggle, the squinting, the trouble that nearsighted women experience when they live their life in a blur is highly erotic to me.  Glasses  </p><p> </p><p>When you boil it down, eyescene is a collection of links to be used by glasses fetishists for private sexual stimulation and masturbation.  That is what makes it difficult to sift through the fodder and find women without glasses.  I think the use of the word girls sounds too grade school and too pedophiliac for me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2017, 19:27</p><p>Pretty sure he said "I too am turned on" rather than "I am too turned on."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dude With A Fetish</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2017, 07:48</p><p>Not sure why post was deleted, but not sure I understand meaning of too turned on. I thought that was the point?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dude With A Fetish</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2017, 17:06</p><p>I guess I'm unsure of how one can be "too turned on"... as in cant perform/last very long when presented with a situation like that? I am also a fan of wearing others thick glasses. I mean, I thought the point was partially to excite yourself (or knowing that you will become excited)? I get fairly excited as well but have always found a way to keep it in control until needed </p><p> </p><p>Not throwing anyone under the bus and no malicious intent, just trying to understand</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2017, 09:20</p><p>I think glasses reenhance beauty in a big way. Glasses can turn an average/ordinary looking girl into someone interesting, even fascinating. And they can turn pretty women into gorgeous women. It may not be real, as it's only a prop. But for a moment, while they're wearing their glasses, it SEEMS real. </p><p> </p><p>But of course, it's not just the frames (and that's why plano lenses don't do it for me), it's the lenses too. They add something, a mystery, a depth. </p><p> </p><p>In my case, it took some time to get into really thick lenses and appreciate their beauty. Now I love them, anywhere between -7 and -25 makes me melt. And I agree that there is a certain element of vulnerability in very thick lenses that can be alluring. </p><p> </p><p>I coincide with Maxim that I too get turned on when I wear glasses that are someone else's prescription, and I wonder what the psychology behind that is. Perhaps the fact that one seems to borrow someone else's eyes and therefore turn into someone new? Watching a distorted world that one can complete with one's imagination?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gerry</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2017, 07:14</p><p>HI Di, I do love ladies with thick glasses, but i also like a lady to be be respected and loved for who she his. First introduction only last 30 seconds, after which its the personality that matters. No matter how someone looks you can always see beauty. Meeting someone and growing together in love is far more important than attractiveness. Hope you soon find a nice guy take good care. Bye</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2017, 21:47</p><p>It depends how you use the glasses, perhaps relevant to your personality. If your personality is more authoritative then you probably would appear more focused on your glasses. If your personality is less authoritative , then you probably do not mind to "look weak" and tend to appear less focused. I still look somewhat "not focused" when wearing glasses , and my personality does not appear to be authoritative than average, I would rarely stare at others, socially rather shy. Whether I wear glasses does not change most of my personality, but would have some minor effect on some of my behavior.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2017, 21:27</p><p>I feel power rings is commonly perceived as "weakness" by ordinary people who typically dislike glasses</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dude With a Fetish</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2017, 20:17</p><p>My threshold for thickness is somewhere between -7 and -9... I love seeing the power rings as we lean in to kiss and as I look up at her and she at me as we do "other" things...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2017, 16:40</p><p>PS.: </p><p> </p><p>I am not a feminist, but, would somebody of our estimated readers and contributors define a man (a male person) as "weak", when it is necessary for him to wear glasses? </p><p> </p><p>I feel, there are many other criteria relevant for assigning 'strength' or 'weakness' to someone's personality, and the approach to glasses wearing has lit up from a certain middle age prejustice over the decades towards wide acceptance nowadays! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2017, 12:02</p><p>I don't share the opinion of "Tom" at all when he says "Bad eyesight, without glasses they cannot see well, are kind of vulnerable and are dependent on others". Just because she wears glasses doesn't mean she can't see. Things maybe out of focus or blurry without her glasses but in many cases she is still able to see well enough not to be vulnerable or dependent on others for help. Because she wears glasses doesn't make her "weak" only her eyesight maybe weak without her glasses. Because glasses have become so popular with many young ladies they are wearing their glasses more often even with a very weak prescription as a fashion accessory as well as providing them with perfect vision. I don't think any woman would ever have to "surrender herself to your power" just because she removes her glasses or allows you to remove them. Really? Actually I think many young ladies look more in power and authoritative if they are wearing glasses. There have even been polls done where it has been proven that a young lady wearing glasses is likely to be hired for a job than one not wearing glasses. Just as "Catwoman" said her less than perfect eyesight has not in anyway been a handicap in her being in charge at home as well as in her job. But I like you do appreciate seeing so many young ladies wearing glasses now. It seems an average looking young woman looks better if if she is wearing glasses and an already attractive young woman will look even more amazing if she is wearing glasses. For many women glasses really do enhance their looks. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Catwoman</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2017, 10:11</p><p>Maxim: </p><p> </p><p>You make a good point about women with glasses not being weak (except for our vision).  I wear cateyes all the time, and I have been told that they give me an authoritative look, especially the ones that are dark at the top and clear at the bottom (currently 3 of my 7 frames).  I like that look about me, as it definitely works on my husband, daughters, and subordinates at work.  :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2017, 18:10</p><p>Hello, </p><p> </p><p>You are writing: </p><p>"The above is why we, glasses fetishists, are not at all attracted by girls with contacts: their weakness is less visible, they cannot whip off their lenses the same way a girl can ditch her specs, and you (as a lover) cannot remove her contacts. </p><p> </p><p>... and I have quite a different experience .... </p><p> </p><p>In the old times, when CLs were not as popular as nowadays, and when nobody literally had ever seen CLs, I dated a girl from the US, who had come to our town as an exchange student. She was wearing contacts, and I was so eager and impatient to try her lenses - the first time in my life, that I had met someone wearing CLs. As a proof of love and confidence she eventually gave in - and then she could not see properly, and eventually we experienced the greatest difficulties to get these lenses out of my eyes, it was a terrible afternoon for both of us, and a comedy for all the friends sitting around us. My sore red eyes needed three days to recover! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2017, 17:58</p><p>PS.: </p><p> </p><p>I don't think, that GWGs are generally weak.  </p><p> </p><p>Many of them are very tough girls. And girls with greater vision defects are strong in their personality, they have to cope   -  and usually they have coped with a somewhat poorer vision, what many people regard as a shortcoming. </p><p> </p><p>For me GWGs are strong personalities, and I respect them as such. </p><p> </p><p>And I am convinced, that everyone giving a natural respect to our GWGs, will have a much better and balanced relation to them as those, who treat them as the 'poor &amp; weak'. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2017, 17:50</p><p>GWGs - </p><p> </p><p>I just find them beautiful. </p><p> </p><p>Sometimes, their frames are pieces of art, or pieces of simplicity and beauty, and these glasses add a further dimension of beauty to these girls. </p><p> </p><p>You understand what I'm saying, when you see the same girl with different frames. A beautiful girl will always be a beautiful girl, but for me more beautiful with glasses than without.  </p><p> </p><p>But if you see a real beauty with nine different frames, and on one picture without a frame, you feel something missing.  </p><p> </p><p>The lenses can be part of this addition to beauty, myopic lenses can remind you of diamonds, hyperop lenses enlargen beautiful eyes etc. </p><p> </p><p>Myself, I'm turned on by the feeling of glasses plus by the distortion (blurr) when wearing glasses that don't fit to my vision values.  </p><p> </p><p>I do like experiencing poor vision and its correction, producing blurr with contact lenses and compensating this with glasses (GOC). I do both, myop and hyperop, but not too strong (between +6.00 and -7.00, not more). I'm planing experiments with prisms.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2017, 16:45</p><p>To Rafa and SPQ </p><p> </p><p>I spent many many hours the past years surfing the net and trying to find out more about glasses fetish (which I also have). There seems to be a common understanding between all "researches".  </p><p> </p><p>GWGs very explicitly show us (through their glasses) a weakness: bad eyesight. Without glasses they cannot see well, are kind of vulnerable and dependent on others. The exciting thing about dating a GWG is that, if she takes off her glasses herself she surrenders to your "power", or she gives you the right to (gently) remove her specs when you wish to do so. </p><p> </p><p>The above is why we, glasses fetishists, are not at all attracted by girls with contacts: their weakness is less visible, they cannot whip off their lenses the same way a girl can ditch her specs, and you (as a lover) cannot remove her contacts. </p><p> </p><p>I am excited by seeing a girl in glasses the same way as I am excited by a GWG not wearing her glasses, knowing she cannot see well there and now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2017, 16:08</p><p>SPQ </p><p> </p><p>I too am interested in discussing the psychological aspect of our glasses fetish, but it's hard to find anything about it on the internet, let alone books. Have you read anything interesting about it? It is striking that being such a fairly common fetish, there is so little literature or research about it.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;24 Jan 2017, 14:34</p><p>I thought glasses means nerdy or hardworking, or deviate from average girls. I was attracted to nerdy girls  because they had top scores in class , I thought they are smarter than me at age 9 . Age 9 I also wanted to be as nerdy as those top scored girls and be one of the top scoring girl myself. I wanted to join their community</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2017, 20:35</p><p>I try not to over-analyze things.  SPQ, you seem to be secure enough in the way you present yourself that you go after your own image even against the mainstream.  In my experience, these sort of things can serve you well in the long run.  Over time, you may start to notice that people (especially those close to you) feed off of your confidence and quit making a big deal out of wearing contacts or hiding their thick lenses, which can work to your advantage.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SPQ</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2017, 16:40</p><p>Interesting stuff Soundman and calcat. I also am absolutely turned on by lenses thicker than the frames, but semi-rimless is by far my favorite type of frame; especially high prescriptions in semi-rimless which are just so thick and so visible (but so darn rare!) What's very surprising is that I'm not as into myodiscs; obviously I love the high myopia but I much prefer a thick non-myodisc lens, especially when the wearer needs a stronger prescription and is squinting and pushing their glasses up. That just makes me melt (straight college-age male, for the record).  </p><p> </p><p>Soundman: My lenses are actually 1.67; I can attach a picture if you're interested. The lenses are definitely the reason I chose semi-rimless, in a full frame w/decent index my lenses wouldn't even stick out. I'm quite busy in my daily life so I don't have time for GOC or anything like that, only passive admiration!  </p><p> </p><p>In general, I'm very interested in discussing the psychology aspect of our fetish and I feel like the sightings/nearsightings thread is kind of dying out/full of overblown/fake episodes -- which is a shame because that's one of my favorite threads. I'm definitely a bit self-conscious of my fetish and I would classify myself as fairly average/normal in other ways (not that it's bad to be different!), but I guess this is the site to spill the beans :))  </p><p> </p><p>Thoughts? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2017, 15:28</p><p>When I was growing up, nylon and drilled rimless styles were very rare.  For me, any minus lenses that were thicker than the frame holding them seemed "thick" to me.  When I see thick lenses, I stop looking at the frame and my attention is diverted instead to the unique ways the lens bulges out towards the edge.  Then I would start to imagine what it would be like to wear the thick glasses, wondering what shape and how thick a ring of light would be cast around the field of vision, and how heavy they would feel sitting on my nose.  My imaginations are realized now that I have progressed to -16.25 lenses that run the 17mm thick edges that the blanks probably started with.  But I still dig myodiscs or anything over 10mm thick, as such a sighting is very rare.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2017, 09:31</p><p>SPQ </p><p>I can only speak for myself, but if your glasses are -7.00 and semi-rimless, which just happens to a favorite style of glasses for me anyway, then I would say that your glasses would more than qualify as being "thick". I assume you enjoy showing how thick your lenses are by choosing that style of frame for your glasses. So your lenses are likely the regular 1.50 thickness as opposed to the thinner high index lenses available. Do you get many comments on your glasses? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SPQ</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2017, 03:57</p><p>Just out of curiosity, what is your guys' threshold for "thick" glasses? At what edge thickness do glasses become thick? </p><p> </p><p>I wear about -7 semi-rimless, and they're 5.5 mm or so thick on the edges. Just curious what level of thickness turns you on. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dude with a Fetish</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2017, 13:46</p><p>Not sure whether this is more for XXX links(eventhough it's just a story) </p><p>I'm turned on by wearing strong minus glasses in bed with women who also wear strong minus glasses. My ultimate fantasy is to sit in a jacuzzi with my fiancé who wears minus glasses while we watch a movie featuring a threesome with two women who wear glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>nnn</b>&nbsp;10 Oct 2016, 07:43</p><p>I am really turned on by girls with thick glasses. Generally, a prescription between -14D and -30D are really nice for me. </p><p> </p><p>But the thing that makes me crazy is a girl with thick glass squinting her eyes. Imagine this scene,  A girl wearing a pair of rimless glasses with -20D, which people can observe its thickness from side. She walked on the street, trying to see a sign far from her. She push her glasses tight against her face, then squint her eyes so hard and finally see the word on the sign. I will be so happy that she can see that cuz without that thick glass, she can not even see word that is 6cm away. </p><p> </p><p>I dont think thick glasses is a burden to girls with bad eyesight. They are a gift. God gives them bad eyesight, they accepted it and can see the beauty of world with thick glasses and also have a wonderful life, this is amazing</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adam</b>&nbsp;02 Oct 2016, 13:38</p><p>I'm not turned on because of the glasses itself. I'm totally turned on because of bad eyesight. I really love girls with high minus glasses.  </p><p>To tell the truth, glasses itself is not enough for me. I also need to see her squinting and being cross-eyed. In most cases these are together with bad eyesight. Crossed eyes doesn't have to mean lazy eye, it is better if both eyes are turning in or out. Eyes turning out are the best for me but I also like when they are turning in. The ideal girl has about -8 glasses, her eyes are a bit turning out and she is squinting even if she is wearing glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;16 Aug 2016, 21:50</p><p>Di </p><p> You sound like a wonderful woman ,with a lot to offer in a relationship.  </p><p> Hang in there Babe!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Aug 2016, 11:52</p><p>Di </p><p>I'm sorry that things didn't work out between you and that gentleman but i'm glad to hear that the breakup really had nothing to do with his fetish for your glasses. Like you said early on even though it came as a surprise to you when he admitted that he had a glasses fetish. Many women might have ended things right there but instead you just became more curious and interested about his fascination of women wearing strong glasses. That was how you ended up in here. After coming in here it seems that you have learned that there are more men than just the one that was attracted not only by you but by your glasses as well. I'm sure you never had any idea before this guy came along that anyone might be attracted you because of your need for glasses? Even though you weren't totally okay knowing about his fetish you must have still been somewhat flattered that he found you so attractive wearing glasses. I'm sure that once you trusted him you were okay with him removing your glasses at times and maybe even cleaning them for you if they had smudges on the lenses. And he must not have ever done anything with your glasses that might have scared you or you would never let him touch your glasses again. I am only guessing but it could be that your ex likes women wearing strong glasses because he knows without their glasses they are quite vulnerable because they can barely see anything. I'm sure that you have told both your daughters all about your ex and his glasses fetish. If I recall both your daughters wear glasses but much weaker than yours. But they both are likely to come across men that find them even more attractive because they are wearing glasses. It doesn't always have to be strong glasses like it was for you but even much weaker glasses can be appealing for many men out here. Only difference is that they probably won't admit it to your daughters, they will just have to find out for themselves. You seem to have a lot to offer a man and I think any man would be lucky to have a woman like you. Just make a point to stay out there and you will be found.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Di</b>&nbsp;16 Aug 2016, 09:47</p><p>Hi Colin. Oh it's not a problem that the relationship I was in didn't last. He's 45 and I'm 60, although most people think I look around 50. In fact I think he thought I was about that age until he found out I have a 38 year old daughter. We had different needs, I think he genuinely fancied me but my eyesight issues were definitely an added bonus, he was honest enough to admit it and I give him credit for that. I actually didn't mind the effect my glasses and especially my absolute need for them had on him. In fact, I'm quite broad minded and without getting too graphic I quite enjoyed using my short sightedness as a means to turn him on. I felt like I had a level control and power in that respect. However, a relationship has to be about more than just the sexual side and as people we weren't as compatible as I would have liked. It was me who ended it and I don't have any regrets. </p><p>I've been widowed for over 3 years now and for that time I've shared my house with my younger daughter but when she starts university in the next month or so, I'll be alone for the first time since my early 20's. I would like to find a partner to share my life with but I'm not desperate to take the next man who comes along. I'm a retired medical practitioner (yes I did get pregnant while still at medical school) so I'm at home a lot, although I do have a number of good friends and plenty of outside interests to keep me occupied. As I say I am broad minded and have a strong fascination for the human condition so I find it very interesting that my ex partner and seemingly many of you have an intense reaction to women with poor eyesight. I'm happy to discuss the subject on here if anyone would like to.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;12 Aug 2016, 17:01</p><p>Dinah (Di) </p><p> </p><p>I have read your posts with great interest. I was sorry to hear your relationship didn't develop. I hope it hasn't clouded your view of us weird lot who find glasses sexually attractive.  More weirdly I find my own strong glasses sexy but can't explain why.    I don't know if you still want to know any more about our strange feelings but please do ask if you want to.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mr Jules</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2016, 09:49</p><p>Until I was 40, I had perfect vision and never wore glasses. So I was always curious about wearing glasses. I was appealed by the way they changed the appearance of a person's eyes. The idea of having to wear something on your face all day long. And being dependent on glasses. All interesting. </p><p> </p><p>Presbyopia started when I was 40. It's steadily worsened and I now wear glasses full time. I am completely dependent on my glasses for close-up activities like reading and eating. And my distance vision needs correction, too. So I wear varifocals to correct all aspects of my vision. </p><p> </p><p>I really like looking at something across the other side of the room, not being able to see properly and then putting on my glasses to see it clearly. </p><p> </p><p>Glasses are now an integral feature of my face. I do not like my appearance without my glasses. And I like the fact that I can only see my reflection in a mirror properly with my glasses on.  </p><p> </p><p>And I'm still interested in other people wearing glasses. I like to observe what type of lenses they might have or how strong they are. Sometimes, I become so engrossed in someone else wearing glasses, that I forget that I wear glasses, too. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Di</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2016, 08:17</p><p>No relationship for me I'm afraid. I'm young (at heart), free and single again. It didn't work out, he was much younger than me and lets just say we wanted different things. Fun while it lasted though.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2016, 19:08</p><p>Dinah (Di) </p><p> Glad to see you post again. </p><p> How is the relationship going? Hope all is well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dinah (Di)</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2016, 09:24</p><p>Just seen the post below was directed to me. To be honest I'm not really sure what your question is but I'm wondering if the glasses your girlfriend wore were perhaps after cataract surgery? I'm confused when you say her glasses looked like thick reading glasses but she was nearsighted. </p><p>My retinal detachment was as a result of my extreme short sight and longer than normal eyes not the other way round. However after I had surgery to reattach the retina my prescription in that eye did change by a couple of dioptres. I don't think contact lens wear can cause retina issues but I'm not an expert.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 23:23</p><p>Hi Dinah, </p><p> </p><p>You actually seem to be the perfect person I want to ask about something somewhat unrelated and the timing of you coming here seems impeccable. </p><p> </p><p>I recently had a pretty short relationship breakup but not over anything eyesight or glasses related. One thing I always wondered though is that even though she wore contacts mostly and technically she was nearsighted but her glasses were very thick even when hi-index that they resembled reading glasses. I did see some younger pictures of her it seemed like she was more of a -4 to -8 and was wondering if the prescription jumping to that high was a result of your retinal detachments. TBH even for someone like me on this site, those glasses did end up being a turnoff though I think I could have learned to enjoy them eventually. Was overuse of contacts a factor in the detachments? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2016, 14:17</p><p>Murky </p><p> </p><p>My wife bought those Prada frames in a deep purple colour 6 years ago, much to my delight, and surprise as she never opted for bold frames before. Last year she chose to not upgrade them for her latest prescription increase as she also had newer frames, but luckily she kept the Pradas. Two weeks ago we went to a party and she took them of their case again, cleaned the lenses diligently and put them on as she thought they fitted her clothes real well. I complimented her on the nice match with her black dress, and she looked real sexy in them all night as the weaker prescription made her squint each time she tried to focus on people/items at a larger distance. </p><p> </p><p>There is a nice YouTube makeup tutorial around of a girl in those deep purple Pradas, will try to find them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2016, 08:32</p><p>murky </p><p>The idea of getting some business cards printed up indicating that you buy used specialty and designer glasses is really a great idea. It's also a great way to chat with the ladies wearing the glasses and even be able to get a look at them on the spot as well. If they ask why you want to buy their glasses you can tell them that you resell them or that your a collector. Even though glasses can be very expensive used glasses, even designer glasses have very little value. I'm not sure a PO box is a good idea because how would you be paying them? Most people aren't going to send off even old glasses to a PO box and not know if they will ever be compensated for their glasses. You probably will need to provide a phone number and then arrange a meeting point. Do you have any price in mind what you would be willing to pay for these used glasses? That is up to you but I think anything more than $25.00 would be too much. But even if they aren't interested in selling their old glasses it still gets you nice way to have a quick chat with them and the business card make things more on a professional level as well.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dinah</b>&nbsp;26 May 2016, 09:05</p><p>Thank you to those who replied to my post. It's certainly an interesting phenomenon and one that I didn't realise existed until recently. It seems to be a kind of obsession along with a sexual element and of course those two things are very powerful and extremely difficult to ignore. It also seems that some of you keep this thing under wraps and wouldn't feel comfortable telling anyone (least of all your partners) about it. I wouldn't call it being ashamed but there is definitely a fear of perhaps what others would think if you told them presumably because it is quite out of the norm. I guess I understand that and appreciate why you would want to keep it to yourself. This makes it all the more amazing that my boyfriend (it seems weird to refer to someone as my boyfriend at my age even though he is quite a bit younger than me) should talk about it openly so soon after meeting me. Maybe it's testament to the intimacy of our relationship that he felt comfortable in doing so within a few weeks of meeting me and therefore something I should welcome. I need to think more on this but wanted to reply so as not to appear to be ignoring you all. </p><p>I can answer a few of your questions though. I wrote my prescription down when I posted previously, it's over -20 in both eyes for my short sight with additions for intermediate and reading requiring me to wear varifocals. I have suffered two retinal tears/detachments over the years and as a result don't have perfect vision even wearing glasses. I haven't noticed any unusual behaviour from any man I've been with regarding my eyesight other than the usual interest. No taking my glasses off, trying them on, asking me how many fingers they are holding up or that kind of thing. Of course my glasses are obviously strong and so people sometimes ask my prescription or delve further and ask how poor my eyesight is, how I see things and so on but I think that's just natural curiosity. The only thing I could say that is perhaps unusual is that I've been asked to keep my glasses on during intimacy whereas all my life I've just automatically taken them off and placed them somewhere safe before getting intimate.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GOCer</b>&nbsp;25 May 2016, 14:30</p><p>One thing rafa says that I would like to echo is that we "cant help glancing on the streets at women who wear glasses."  In a nutshell, I finally acknowledged that the force of glasses that sweeps me up is one that must be reckoned with.  After some failed dating experiences, I finally made myself a promise to marry someone who wears strong glasses.  It would simply not be fair to make a marriage vow to a lady, knowing that I would be looking at all these other women who wore stronger glasses.  Dinah, if your partner has similar experiences, I wish you all a happy relationship and companionship that can be matched by no other.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;25 May 2016, 11:11</p><p>Dina-  How strong are your glasses?  Do you wear them all the time? Has he asked to try them or have you offered? Can he see through them?  My other would let me try hers, but now I don't bother because they became way to strong for me to see anything...but I love them on her.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;25 May 2016, 10:39</p><p>Dinah, </p><p> </p><p>I think its great that youve visited the site and posted asking for insight about your partners thing for glasses. That shows courage. </p><p> </p><p>I can only speak for myself (and Ive only been aware of this site very recently) but Im really glad that you did. Because it gives us the opportunity to tell you those things that a lot of us would like to tell our wives or girlfriends and cant brave to. It can be a very lonely place where we sometimes find ourselves. </p><p> </p><p>First of all, we dont know why we have this thing with glasses or where it comes from. In my case Im pretty sure its not genetic or inherited from any of my parents. One day in our puberty we find ourselves swept by it. And that is disconcerting. The first reaction is to think that we are some kind of weirdoes, since we dont get aroused like most guys do (by watching porn) but by watching glasses on a pretty womans face. And then you find a way of living with it, hoping to find someone who would understand you or even share that same thing for glasses. Some people try to hide it and keep it in check, some others try to act it out and incorporated to their daily lives with all normality. </p><p> </p><p>Again, I can only speak for myself, but yes, the glasses are a bonus. We dont fall in love with shortsightedness. We fall in love with a person. But the combination of that person and (dare I say, the right) glasses can really turn us on. We look for women who wear glasses because we feel that possibly our sex life will be more fulfilling, but you dont get to choose who you fall in love with, and Im sure that a lot of us have experienced falling in love with women with perfect eyesight or even women who dislike glasses. But what is pretty obvious is the fact that even we get attracted by a gorgeous woman with some really cool glasses, if the person isnt someone who is on your wavelength, then the relationship will not hold water. We too are attracted to intelligence, sense of humor and all the traits that normal people are attracted to. Shortsightedness (or any other visual imperfection) is just another trait we look for in our love life partners, like some people look for certain political ideas or a certain musical taste. We look for someone who can share and understand our passion for glasses. It might seem something superficial, of course it hasnt got the same importance as politics or music or art. And we know it. We can put it in its proper place. I mean, I wouldnt be able to be in a relationship with someone who votes for an extreme right party or someone who likes Justin Bieber, but I could be in a relationship with someone who never wears glasses.   </p><p> </p><p>And Im pretty sure that the reason we are attracted to (very) shortsighted women is not because that shows some vulnerability or dependence on the man, because we too like being (very) shortsighted ourselves. Dont ask me why, but we do.  I myself have asked a couple of therapists about it, and none of them came up with a convincing explanation. </p><p> </p><p>My basic point is that our thing with glasses isnt an overriding thing and it SHOULDNT be a problem at all in your relationship with him. Why would it? If, say, he wants/needs you to keep your glasses on while having sex, why not do it? Why would that be a problem? </p><p> </p><p>And from his point of view, I cant tell you how great it would be for him if you could incorporate his thing with glasses into your daily life with normality. It would really make him very happy. </p><p> </p><p>The only thing you might have to put up with is that you may find that he cant help glancing on the streets at women who wear glasses, although nowadays there are so many, that we tend to get more selective, and only glance at those who are attractive and wear the right glasses (we tend to avoid those with fake lenses).  But that would only be a minor quibble, wouldnt it? </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, I wish you the best with him, and would love to hear back from you in the future . </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;24 May 2016, 12:07</p><p>Dinah </p><p>I do recall your earlier comments about this gentleman and your relationship. First of all I am really glad to hear that your still together. I was hoping that admission about his glasses fetish didn't ruin the relationship when so many other things seemed so perfect to you about him. I'm sure his thing for glasses must seem very strange you when you probably wished you didn't even need them at all. But to your credit even though this seemed strange to you, you didn't run the other direction from him. Look at it this way he could have had a much worse fetish than "glasses". Is there anything he says or does that troubles you about his thing for glasses? I guess what I am asking is if there is anything or time when he makes you feel uncomfortable about your glasses? You have to appreciate his being so honest and telling you about his obsession for glasses. Like you say you want your relationship to be an honest one that is being pretty honest. I think you will read in here about several men that not only have girlfriends that wear glasses that they have never told about there obsession for glasses but even several married en that they have never told their wife about their thing for their glasses. You seem completely happy with this fellow so I say you should just go for it and not let his glasses thing bother you. Hope that helped in some way. To be honest I dated a good number of women back in my dating days and nearly everyone of them wore glasses but I never once told any of them about my glasses fetish.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dinah</b>&nbsp;24 May 2016, 11:29</p><p>Hi. I wrote a while back about a lovely man I had recently embarked on a relationship with who had admitted one evening that he had a "thing" for women in glasses. My husband died 3 years ago and I've been lonely and in a very dark place for much of the intervening time and so I was delighted to meet someone who seemed to be very much on my wavelength and who I hit it off with almost immediately. I was therefore a little taken aback by his admission and of course wondered if the fact that I wore glasses was the main reason he was interested in me. We're still together and we have discussed this attraction of his a few times and while I don't understand it, I do feel he likes (dare I say it loves?) me for who I am and that my eyesight is a bonus for him. It hasn't really played a major part in our relationship to be honest, I haven't really noticed him behaving differently towards me than other men I've known and we do have a wonderful time together. Anyway I will stop rambling on and get to the point. He has said that he has visited this site on occasions and he suggested that it might help me understand the attraction for short sighted women if I wrote about it on here and asked regular contributors for their take. So really I was just wondering if anyone can help me understand a little better. Your point of view would be very much appreciated.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;07 May 2016, 06:06</p><p>I have a history of reluctant to wear glasses perhaps until age 25. </p><p>when I was younger like age 10-20 I would have some bad understanding about myopia. I thought it is normal to put books close to eyes when we are myopic .  </p><p> </p><p>But now I can realize , now I can have normal posture to read when wearing my glasses that is slightly more than minus 4 diopters L -4 R -4.25 (this is a weaker rx that was my distance rx 5 years ago so now I use for reading) , but unable to have normal posture to read without glasses. I would be very happy to realize it is so beautiful and comfortable to have good posture. Having normal posture would at least reduce my risk from neck pain, back pain and injured backbone caused by head sticking close to the screen .  </p><p> </p><p>I knew from someone in the optical industry that, my high-index lenses can block 90% UVA radiation and 99% UVB radiation that is very nice to know, and that I would thank my glasses so much partly because of that. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;07 May 2016, 05:38</p><p>I actually think they should be happy to wear glasses because the reason I would most likely come to my mind is : contact lenses easily cause the cornea to become infected . I know most of them thought contact lenses are better, but I would not prefer contact lenses throughout my 27 years of life.  </p><p> </p><p>I was myopic since young age. about 20 years ago I was told by some ads telling me : I can control my myopia if I do not wear any minus lenses. I was thrilled by these ads because I liked to see other girls wearing glasses but disliked having to wear the glasses myself. I thought glasses was ugly. The minus lenses are showing my visual vulnerability that is myopia.  </p><p> </p><p>But as I lived through these years, I may have a rough estimate about the prevalence of myopia. Now I would normally expect most girls in their age 18-35 would need correction from minus lenses typically not within 1 or 2 diopters.  </p><p> </p><p>Now I realize there are some advantages of wearing glasses for girls , and that the myopia-cure ads was false : glasses are not harmful to my eyes. If I have no glasses with my rx or I cannot afford to have any glasses with my rx, my life would be even more miserable.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2016, 09:43</p><p>Astra </p><p>It seems that most Asian women wear glasses or contacts usually from a rather early age. It could be due to how much studying is done which brings on the need for glasses. It now seems like the rest of the world is beginning to catch up in that area since now more than 75% of the population now wears some form of vision correction. That number is even higher for women. But what is believed to have caused this increase is so many I-Phones and other devices with small type and texting has become so popular. Interesting that by the time you were 14 only 4 girls in your class weren't wearing either glasses or contacts, but before they turned 16, 3 of those girls were now wearing glasses. The one remaining holdout is now 19 and she is now wearing glasses as well. You of course seem to be very excited about wearing glasses and you seem to think that other girls are equally excited about needing glasses. What makes you think that since some of them wear contacts instead? I do agree with you that just seeing an attractive young lady wearing glasses is enough of a turn on for me. Her glasses don't have to be strong, in fact even if her glasses are extremely weak is okay with me. Like you I also enjoy the changes in their eyesight as time goes on. Since I order the glasses for quite a few of these young ladies and I love getting a call from them telling me that they got their eyes examined and they need me to order them new glasses because their eyes got a bit worse.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;28 Apr 2016, 03:08</p><p>After age 14 there were not many girls in my class that were not wearing glasses or contact lenses . I got even more curious about these special girls that are not wearing either at that time because girls not wearing either was rare at that age. I got curious about the girls that are not seen wearing glasses , one of them being taller (about 1.7 m) , usually arranged back row of seat by the teacher . Eventually by age 15-16 I have seen three of the four remaining girls have to wear glasses with minus lenses to see the blackboard (or whiteboard). The taller girl appeared reluctant to wear her glasses full time . At age 17-19 we are no longer in the same class. By the time we graduated from high school at age 19. Now at year 2016, on the public photo album of the final day of school I can see her finally wearing the glasses, facing left unfortunately so that we can't see further detail about her face. Wearing minus lenses with a full-framed glasses is one of the most wonderful thing happened in my life, and I assume this is true for most girls. </p><p></p><hr>

But it was a wonderful experience to know there was a website known as eyescene ten years ago. I realize I am not alone, can be secretly collecting information about girls wearing glasses , wanted to track how their rx changes , how they wear different glasses with different rx , occasionally i can be curious about the physical problems of their glasses, such as scratches, rotated frames. It is interesting to see how some of those girls changed rx with the same frame, or changing glasses with very similar design that almost appear they are the same frame. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2016, 01:26</p><p>Jes - I'm with you on this one, and have done this quite a few times with GOC, as posted on the GOC section. I don't wear glasses at all, but recently bought a pair of aviators as my next pair to get reglazed with my GOC prescription. They're a used pair of glasses with a weak prescription, probably only -1.5 or something like that and wearing them with such a weak prescription just doesn't have the same feeling / buzz as with much stronger lenses. I too have noticed reactions and people looking a lot more than I think they normally would when I've worn my strong glasses. I have about 5 different pairs, with 3 of them having a prescription of approx -9.5/-10, and the other pairs are -13</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lurking</b>&nbsp;26 Apr 2016, 20:04</p><p>Tom1/Jess: I share both of your desires but mostly I lean more toward wearing my minus 20 glasses over my +13 contacts. I usually get at least one or two stares whenever I go out wearing these glasses as the lenses are over a half inch thick.

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;26 Apr 2016, 14:55</p><p>I have a similar obsession for sighting on me, but opposite: I love going around bareeyed and wonder if people around me realise I can't see or not... (I'm pretty sure usually not)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JES</b>&nbsp;26 Apr 2016, 05:02</p><p>Some time ago I bought a pair of used glasses from my local flee-market. My own prescription is a mild -3. I have always wanted a stronger prescription and have felt attracted to people (women) wearing strong negative glasses. Today I wore these glasses that I had bought publicly. I went to a shopping mall and walked around wearing these coke-bottles. I don't actually know the strength of these lenses but I have a guess that the left lens is about twice as strong as mine and the right lens about three times my own prescription. That would be -6 and -9! </p><p>The lenses are very thick because the frame size is 59mm and the lenses are standard thickness. My eyes looked so very small behind these glasses and cut-in is clearly noticeable. I felt very attractive walking around in these. This was a long waited for moment, and I also thought I noticed a couple of women looking at me, staring and thinking.."oh my, that bloke must be really nearsighted.." </p><p>A nice experience altogether..

Don't get me wrong, a lot of the posts on here are very articulate and informed and I'm not trying to be judgemental. What I do notice is that most of the replies concentrate on the aesthetic of a woman wearing glasses and while I can quite agree that women can look very attractive in glasses (I hope so anyway), I do believe that there is a subtext here whereby it's the fact that they can't see well that provides much of the attraction. I'm finding it hard to rationalise the thought that me displaying my poor vision in some way could provoke a sexual reaction in a man. I do struggle with my vision often, even when wearing glasses and it never crossed my mind that it could have an erotic element. </p><p>Anyway I'm still seeing the lovely man I wrote about, I think he's too good to give up over something like this, although it will take me some time to understand I think. I haven't mentioned the issue at all since but I do intend to bring it up again when the time is right. </p><p>Oh and to answer some of your other questions. I live in England and my glasses prescription is a bit complicated but goes something like this: </p><p>Right eye -22.00 sph -2.50 cyl 120 axis +3.00 add </p><p>Left eye -23.25 sph -2.25 cyl 100 axis +3.00 add</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dinah</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2016, 13:46</p><p>Thanks to those who replied to my post. I'm still trying to process what this all means. Maybe I'm overanalysing? It would be the first time. I know he finds me attractive, or at least he's said so. I'm not in bad shape for my age, I'm a member of a running club and still run semi-competitively and I like to keep myself as healthy and fit as I can. I like to think I'm still attractive and very feminine and so maybe as was intimated, the fact that I wear strong glasses is just the icing on the cake and not the whole deal. I'm going to just go with it and see where this relationship takes me. I may end up getting hurt but nothing ventured, nothing gained. I think, as one of you put it, I should be grateful that he's been honest with me. That has to be worth something doesn't it? </p><p>I notice a couple of you asked what my prescription is. I'm not sure what to think about that. Why do you ask? I could hunt out the piece of paper and write the numbers down verbatim because I don't know them off the top of my head but be assured it's very high. I have worn glasses all my life and they've been on my face, save for a brief flirtation with contact lenses in the late 70's, every waking hour. I grab them before I get out of bed and wear them till I'm back in bed and about to turn the light out. I really can't do anything unless I'm wearing them. I don't even think about them much to be honest, the need to put them on in the morning is pretty much an unconscious act. </p><p>I wonder if anyone can describe to me why a woman being so dependent on glasses elicits such an erotic response in some/all of you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>elisetebrand</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2016, 21:36</p><p>hello ..I am 36 and -30 and -31.5 myopia glasses for me are like a magical piece that gives me the power to see the reality of things when I take to my friends I love my glasses most say that I am blind .. if I could have a collection of glasses ..ja went through every situation because he wore thick glasses that today or ligo..no background all myope wanted to find someone who loves her with his glasses ..</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2016, 19:20</p><p>Dinah </p><p> I have dated many women over the years.Some that did not wear glasses,and many that did. </p><p> I look for many attributes in the women that I date,but if they wear glasses,that is extra special. </p><p> My current girlfriend that I have been seeing now for almost a year wears strong glasses. </p><p> Last year in her early forties she had a fair amount of increase to her nearsighted prescription,that resulted in her lenses being plano,or flat on the front sides along with her first bifocal prescription. </p><p> Due to a few events in her younger years,she was quite self conscious about her glasses,and the new stronger Rx,with bifocals embarrassed her. </p><p> When she realized that in addition to caring about her,as well as finding her attractive in glasses,she began to come out of her shell. </p><p> Over the past year we have had many great times,but she admits that some of the best are glasses related.At first she thought it was a little kinky,but when we purchased her a number of unique glasses,she began to think it to be fun. </p><p> She sometimes sees me catching a glance at another attractive girl wearing glasses,and has a subtle way of tapping on her own thick lense with her index finger,and glaring at the girl.Then we both have a good laugh. </p><p> I would say to you if there are so many good things that you see in this guy,continue in the relationship,and lavish the moments that he finds you beautiful in your eyeware. </p><p> What is your prescription?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2016, 08:08</p><p>Firstly, Dinah, give him credit for his honesty.  He didn't need to tell you, but he did. </p><p>Secondly, you will have gathered from this website that this male fondness for bespectacled ladies is not as rare as you might have thought.  And I like to think that we're at least as decent and honourable as any other cross-section of male society. </p><p>Thirdly, I can see that you may have been shocked that a feature you might have at times wished were otherwise- namely your need for (perhaps strong) glasses - was appealing to him.  But would you have been equally shocked if it was some, perhaps more conventional aspect of you which caught his fancy, such as dimples or your breasts or your legs?   </p><p>If everything else about your relationship is working, why let this spoil it.  Decide whether you can live with your friend's little foible and, if you can, carry on as normal.  If he has noticed your recent coldness and asks about, just be as honest with him as he has been with you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LEO in PERTH</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2016, 07:38</p><p>Dinah, </p><p>That's Why I never tell Ladies they look beautiful wearing glasses ! It seems ok to tell a lady you attracted to her by the way she dresses ,or styles (or cuts ) her hair. </p><p>Once upon a time ,It was unattractive to wear Glasses ( not for me ) Now days, more people see how BEAUTIFUL they are! </p><p>and why not? Iám in my early 60s , and always found Myopic Ladies attractive ,for the past 50 years!! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>minus5wholuvsgwgs</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2016, 07:35</p><p>Dinah I am one of those men who like girls with thick glasses .My own girl friend too is highly myopic minus15/minus 16.25 yes the thick glasses were a huge attraction BUT its the lady underneath that is who I love the glasses are just the icing on the cake just as like most men I like sexy underwear etc So please do not be cold towards him go for it girl he sounds like a very lucky man (and what is your prescription?)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dinah</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2016, 07:05</p><p>Hello. </p><p>I'm a 60 year old widow. I've lived on my own for a few years but about 3 months ago I met a really lovely man and we started seeing each other for meals, trips to concerts and so on. He's wonderful, very intelligent, highly educated, very successful and fun and we get on extremely well together. At this point I should mention that I've been severely short-sighted since before I can remember as it's somewhat pertinent to the story. Anyway, the other night we were sitting together in front of the fire having a glass of wine and chatting and for some reason the conversation turned round to what we found attractive in the opposite sex. Aside from the usual female attributes, he admitted that he found my thick glasses very alluring and the fact that I can barely see without them extremely exciting. I was shocked and didn't really know what to think. I'm afraid I've become rather cold towards him and we haven't really communicated much since. I don't want to lose him but I can't escape the thought that he only wants me because of my eyesight. I suppose the obvious thing is to talk to him about it but I feel quite hurt at the moment and can't trust myself to say the things I need to say in the right way. Searching on the internet I came across this site which I have to say was rather an eye opener to say the least. I don't have a question as such but I'm searching for understanding. I'm hoping I can get over this and hopefully it isn't an issue. Maybe someone on here can help me understand a little better? Thank you in advance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2016, 15:11</p><p>How interesting that so many of us totally enjoy the GWG but for different reasons. As for me to be perfectly honest I am fine with seeing a young lady wearing even weak glasses as long as they are real and she feels the need to be wearing glasses. Many of you seem to really enjoy the girl that wears very strong glasses with the knowledge that without her strong glasses she is pretty much helpless. I totally understand the sight of seeing her straining and squinting trying to see can be quite a turn on. For some seeing how small her eyes appear behind her strong lenses can be a turn on. Something that ranks high on my list is a girl with "virgin eyes" meaning that she has never wore glasses before and is now wearing glasses for the very first time. Things she was once able to see is now blurry without her glasses. So just knowing the effect that glasses are making on her eyes is enough for me. No of course her eyes aren't going to be anywhere near as bad as what the girls with those very strong glasses are like. But I have watched many young ladies get their very first glasses and then watched as every year their eyesight slowly deteriorate and now many of them wear their glasses full time. No their glasses aren't -20.00 something but considerably weaker. But to them they feel like they can't see much of anything without their glasses anymore. So for me it has been very enjoyable just watching the transformation of these girls over the years. But yes of course even seeing someone I don't know that is attractive wearing glasses is always very nice to see. So I guess we all share the same interest but for different reasons.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2016, 15:56</p><p>Tom 1, </p><p> </p><p>Interesting post and question. While we clearly share a fascination for GWG's with higher prescriptions, my fascination works the other way round. I feel attracted to women who wear their strong glasses with confidence and even with pride. My life partner is a full time GWG with a prescription of minus twelve. She has a special "radar" which enables her to go swimming in the sea without any visual aid and even on a crowded beach, she walks straight back to me after her swim. She never stumbles and there is no visual insecurity either. The first time I saw her do this I was flabbergasted and asked her how she managed. She explained that she had a good look at the colours before putting down her glasses. Later she told me that her first glasses ever were no less than minus five. Her parents were ashamed about this, feeling that they should have noticed much earlier that there was a problem. But she probably already had this "radar" in her childhood and that's why nobody noticed it. Eventually her teacher at school noticed it. She got her first pair of glasses, went full time straightaway and that was it. Five years ago I worked with a model with an even higher prescription and she was able to pick the next pair of glasses from the grass without any hesitation. I asked the model - her name was Petra - how she managed and her answer was pretty much the same. Basically it's a matter of self confidence. During my photo shoots, it's always interesting to witness how a new model reacts when she puts on the first pair of glasses with a much higher prescription than her own. Some models need several pairs before some degree of relaxation sets in. But there are also models who are not bothered about the massive blur. Generally speaking, the second category has more self confidence than the first category. I hope that other members here will share their experience with you as you raised an interesting topic.    </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sayitlikeitis</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2016, 15:29</p><p>Exactly Tom1. Surely that's what an optical obsession is all about? I can't imagine why anyone would be interested in glasses themselves, they're just pieces of plastic and/or metal. It's what they signify that is the source of the attraction. As far as I'm concerned, a pair of plano glasses, or indeed glasses with lenses less than about -3 are about as interesting as a handbag or a pair of ear rings.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2016, 14:46</p><p>Never posted here (as far as I remember), but I'll do now since my obsession seems a little bit different from most of you here. </p><p>What I'm attracted from is not just glasses by themselves, but poor vision itself. Glasses are useful as indicator that the owner has low vision, but what attracts mostly myself is that a bespectacled girl is unable to see properly without some kind of aid. This is what actually turns me on, not glasses as an accessory (in fact I don't feel anny atraction for planos, neither for very weak prescription glasses).  </p><p>And since vision defect is even more apparent when one struggles to see without glasses, nearsighted or farsighted girls trying to function bareeyed are for me the hottest subject by far, even more than bespectacled ones. </p><p>Is there anyone else who share this obsession?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2016, 00:16</p><p>I thought I had better post again to explain that I was actually really careful with my girlfriends glasses. When I made them fall off by hooking them with my glasses as we kissed I always made sure they rolled gently onto a pillow.  She usually said something like. "there go the glasses" and I would let her know that I had put them on the bedside cabinet. If she asked about mine but I got turned on by just letting them fall wherever and the excitement of having to hunt for them afterwards. She was thin with long hair and dark eyes and a fairly pointed nose. Comparing her glasses to mine I would guess her prescription at about plus 20 in a dark plastic frame with fairly small buttons.   I loved the way her glasses magnifyed her eyes behind the buttons and how she tilted her head back to see in the distance and tentatively placed her feet when she walked. We have to be careful wearing high plus glasses. If you look straight forward you cannot see the ground in front of you. I loved how she looked up at me when we undressed each other hazing through her thick lenses. Unfortunately she did not share my fascination with our glasses and thought I was a bit weird. I fully agree that I am but the relationship did not last.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2016, 19:02</p><p>I love making love wearing my glasses.  </p><p>When I was a young man I was in a nightclub in Plymouth England. I should explain that this is a naval base and the clubs were full of sailors. I was just checking the place out looking around when someone snatched my glasses off. He obviously did it as a prank as it was obvious that I would not be able to see without them.  I just stood amid the flashing lights and noise wondering what to do. Usually people who take glasses hand them back but nothing came. I slowly made my way to the side of the room and bumped into someone spilling my drink on them.   I said sorry and explained about the glasses. I had to feel for her face and speak into her ear as the music was loud.   She told me to wait there and disappeared.  She must have asked a lot of people because she eventually came back with the glasses and a barmaid who said they had been handed in at the bar.  She looked fantastic with a stunning figure and cheerful smile.   </p><p>We ended up in my hotel room and I slowly kissed her all over making sure my thick lenses rubbed against her body. I gazed at her and she gently removed my glasses and tried them on.  We continued making love both unable to see much and she carefully put them back saying it was unfair to take them. It was a wonderful night. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2016, 18:09</p><p>This may sound weird. I have worn glasses in the plus 30 range following a cateract operation as a baby. Even as a child I remember enjoying the way my strong glasses distorted everything. I was also drawn to other children who wore glasses. There was one boy with strong plus glasses (though not as strong as me) and his frames were terribly bent. He always squinted and I wondered how he could see at all.  A girl in the year below me was exceptionally short sighted. She wore pink plastic NHS glasses with cable temples and flat fronted lenses with lots of ground glass around the edge.   She was very slim with goofy teeth and knock knees but I thought she was wonderful. Her sister said to me once "you fancy my sister don't you". I was only about 14 so we just hung around together and never even kissed. </p><p>For a short time I dated a girl who also wore cateract glasses.  Hers were not as strong as mine. She said that wearing my glasses made close things really clear and I had to wear hers on the tip of my nose to get nearly in focus.  We made love wearing each other's glasses. I enjoyed entangling our glasses so they fell off as we got more excited and we had to grope around afterwards to find them. I loved the danger of risking damage to the glasses.  </p><p>Hope it doesn't sound too weird but it's what turns me on. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Millhouse</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2015, 04:48</p><p>My interest in GWG's I have long been aware of and have been lucky only twice in having gf's with a strong rx on their glasses, I have posted here in the past as to Internet dating sites maybe having a search option for let say "wears glasses" I'm unaware of any, So then, in the off line world I rely on the obvious- the fact they have glasses on- now then, we are all very much aware of just how many women (and men of course) wear contacts,I have an idea to now look and learn how contacts look on the eyes in social interactions and determine, from that glasses will be worn at some point to rest or let wearers recover from near constant use (this I know from my own use years ago as a younger man) </p><p>It seems there is a few google answers to this inquiry here is one helpful link; </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://marcoeyes.tumblr.com/what-it-is-about" target="_blank">http://marcoeyes.tumblr.com/what-it-is-about</a>   </p><p> </p><p>When out and about at work, socially or in public now I will try to spot contacts on new female acquaintances, I will report back in a few weeks with my findings.I will endeavour to be discreet in my observations it goes without saying. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2014, 13:06</p><p>I find girls wearing minus lenses in black plastic frames really turns me on. It's intriguing why black plastic frames seem popular in China and South Korea. Part of the reason could be the high prevalence of myopia above -3 . These girls probably have tried other types of frame, but they would notice the lenses are very visible on the sides as their rx gets higher every 1-2 year. So they may want to have a black plastic frame that could hide some thickness from the edges. What is quite intriguing is that when more girls are doing this, it appears high rx and moderate rx girls prefer black plastic frames. It also appear to me they believe by wearing such frames, their lens thickness would be less visible to others. Their effort to "hide" the thickness does turn me on.  </p><p> </p><p>Despite so much they spend on thinning and disguising the edges of their lenses, often using thicker plastic frame. The black colored frame are optimal to contrast their power rings, cut-in or the partial edge of their lenses. Most likely they are less aware of these effects when the edges are partially hidden by tne frame (?) take it for granted others would not notice them (?) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Toto</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2014, 18:00</p><p>Hey Antonio </p><p> </p><p>I asked her about her prescription tonight. She took put a note that she keeps in her wallet from her latest eye test, that says she is -3.5 in her left eye and -5.25 right. Also some cilinder but she told me thay's really "fine-tuning". </p><p> </p><p>Tonight she was most lovely as she wore specs that she bought a few years ago, matching very nicely with her outfit today, but she compalined a few times "I didn't remember my eyes got that worse since 3 years". Still, I think she looked very hot tonight!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2014, 20:50</p><p>Glassesforeveryone </p><p> </p><p>I in no way am saying in any way that your wife doesn't need her glasses and if she isn't already she will likely be wearing them full time. I am only saying that -3.00 lenses don't need to be made thinner, however if she feels that her lenses may look thick then by all means she should get high index.you are correct in what you say about the number of people that require glasses over -10.00. The percentage is actually rather small compared to all other prescriptions. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glassesforeveryone</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2014, 15:44</p><p>Evening all. I know you guys figure -3 is only minor, but I'd say it's reasonably significant in terms of the bell curve across the people on this planet.  The -10's etc that lots of people here fixate on probably accounts for 2-3% of the population. </p><p> </p><p>I'm happy with my wife's -3 eyes.  As for the thin lenses, she doesn't like glasses, so no way was I pushing the thicker lenses. </p><p> </p><p>Weirdly, as I've got older and my eyes have given up the fight of me trying to make myself myopic (I know wear +1), I'm finding myself attracted to plus lenses. God knows what that says about me. </p><p> </p><p>Thankfully I am still as attracted to my wife as ever.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2014, 15:43</p><p>-3.00?  That's nothing compared to my -9.00 (with CR39 lenses).  I don't believe high-index lenses are all that necessary at -3.00.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2014, 14:55</p><p>Glassesforeveryone </p><p> </p><p>I wonder what the optician was wearing if she was even wearing glasses if she considers -3.00 strong?  Of course she is just lobbying for a sale of high index lenses which really shouldn't be necessary at all. Even Zenni doesn't recommend going to even their medium high index lens with that prescription.  </p><p>I hope your wife didn't take the bate and said no to her.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2014, 14:53</p><p>Hi gfe, glad you enjoyed helping your wife pick out new glasses. but as far as myopic Rx's go her -3 Rx is fairly moderate, but definately needing full time correction. There are myopic corrections that are 2,3,5, even 10 times that strong that produce seriously think lenses. Do you prefer her in thicker or thinner lenses?   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glassesforeveryone</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2014, 13:30</p><p>I met my wife at lunch today at the opticians to help her pick some new glasses. I was in heaven. </p><p> </p><p>I especially liked it when she was told by the assistant that she should get light an thin lenses because her prescription was strong (-3). </p><p> </p><p>Complete turn on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>antonio</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2014, 19:00</p><p>Toto </p><p> </p><p>if I may ask, how strong are the glasses your gf wears ? </p><p> </p><p>best regards, antonio</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Toto</b>&nbsp;31 May 2014, 18:37</p><p>My girlfriend knows very well that, when switiching from contacts to glasses in the evening, or not replacing her glasses by contacts in the morning and thus spending a full day in glasses, she gives me a signal that she is (and wants to feel) vulnerable. </p><p> </p><p>When we kiss, she likes tolose her eyes as a signal that I can gently take off her glasses. Or she lets her glasses slide fown her nose without pushing them back up, making that she has to tilt her head backwards to look through them, or squint because the glasses (she told me) lose some corrective power when down her nose and farther from her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>She has more little tricks she can do with her glasses that (she knows) turn me on. When in a shop last week looking for new shoes, she took off her glasses and handed them over to me, asking whether I could oh please clean the lenses for her. A huge turn on to feel the thickness and curvature of her lenses through a thin piece of cloth while cleaning them. When I told her I thought I was ready, she looked at me with blurred eyes, then closed her eyes as an unspoken request that I please carefully reposition her glasses on her nose.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anton</b>&nbsp;31 May 2014, 18:05</p><p>Well I can definitely understand the vulnerability part. As somebody who needs a correction of -14.25 in both eyes, and was used to wear contacts all the time, now there is not a second I'm awake that I don't have my glasses on including uncomfortable situations as working out, making out, or showering. I'm a 100% dependent on them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Vulnerable Cristalline</b>&nbsp;27 May 2014, 20:27</p><p>I love the fact that many girls are so vulnerable without their glasses, which is very cute . They are also vulnerable wearing their glasses, note, their glasses can't be placed too far from their face when they have about several diopters of myopia, their glasses need to be placed so close to their eyes, so lovely. I wear -5 , always love this vulnerability, that the image of the glasses would SHIFT , when I see my dearly cristalline sharp, rather curved image shifts itself when I walk around, or placing my glasses back to the correct position from lower part of my nose, I feel my vulnerability, I know how important it is to place this lovely gemstone, but I also love to be so vulnerable that I can't see properly when glasses are not properly placed, and the image looks so curved. Even when properly placed, the peripheral are still so curved the wearer can detect by herself, this self-perception of vulnerable curved image is a turn on, also we can notice other girls vulnerability when they are wearing their glasses, we can see their minified, curved image through their lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>anony</b>&nbsp;21 May 2014, 07:41</p><p>I have to say for me it is also the time that a hi myope is wihtout his/her glasses or contacts that is the turn on, especially when they are in an unfamiliar environment and to one degree or another have to feel their way around. The thick glasses are for me just the advertisement of this vulnerability. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anton</b>&nbsp;16 May 2014, 05:59</p><p>@Kit. Well I should say I find it extremely interesting that what you find "exclusivity" as the biggest turn on. It makes a lot of sense specially nowadays when contacts are available for mostly anybody even in a time </p><p>when glasses are more popular than ever before. The truth is that most individuals with high prescriptions are and will always prefer contacts when possible. I know I would. Reason why its been so difficult to become a full time coke bottle glasses wearer. Anyway, because of that many people are just seen in glasses by their partner or by whom they go to bed with so the exclusivity part makes a lot of sense. For a long long time the only person who ever saw me in glasses was my ex- girlfriend. As I never wore them outside my place they were outdated frames with regular plastic very thick lenses in them. I 'm very nearsighted.  </p><p>Is there anything else that you find attractive in a guy in glasses? </p><p>By the way I'm 28.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kit</b>&nbsp;16 May 2014, 03:49</p><p>@Anton: I'm into it when a guy wears contacts during the day and then I love that hour or so before bed when he wears his glasses. It's that side of someone you only see in private...and I'm reminded of that during the day when I search people's eyes for the telltale sign of contacts. Like I'm pretty sure "normal" people don't look for that when they make eye contact with someone. So I guess it's this inner game/obsession I can keep to myself. </p><p> </p><p>Once, I met a friend of a friend at an event. I could tell he was wearing contacts so I got bold and asked for his number. I slept over at his house and in the morning I accidentally put his glasses on.(same rx -3.50/-3.75) So then he put on mine and it led to a lighthearted conversation about rx's. I was very ready for a morning round right after that, but of course he didn't know it was about the glasses. :P It was super hot to be cuddling together with my vision twin and asking something like, "Can you see what time it is?" and him replying, "Not if you can't!" Too bad he got transferred across country for his job. </p><p> </p><p>Of course, I have been disappointed before...so it's not a fool proof method for me. Once, a fairly attractive guy at work was blinking a lot so I pretend to ask "oh, do you have contacts?" Of course I knew he did. He replies, "yeah, I'm totally blind without them!" Later, we go to his place and I go to use the washroom... and see his ~2.0 glasses on counter. Later we were making out and he took off my glasses and put them on and said "wow, yours are even stronger than mine! You're so blind!" I politely laugh and agree, but don't tell him that I do everything bare eyed at home, except watch the TV.  </p><p> </p><p>As for thick lenses, it's not the glasses themselves but what it's like when their glasses come off. I really like being intimate with a bare eyed myopic guy because he gives off this sort of unfocused look and our faces just gravitate closer. But it's also the mundane things like checking email on their phone in the middle of the night or reading a book with the page next to their nose. Again, I think it turns me on because it's a side of the person that most don't get to see and I like that exclusivity.   </p><p> </p><p>But I feel like I'm torturing myself sometimes because I'm only 24 and married to a guy that's 20/20. I got my hopes up last month when he went to the eye doc because of eyestrain...and pretty crushed when he came home without a rx. But maybe it's good, no one else has to know about my secret besides the kind folks here on ES (even though I'm a 8 year lurker). I'm afraid it would come to light IRL if I was in a long term relationship with a very myopic guy.

<p><b>aviator -00- </b>&nbsp;13 May 2014, 19:36</p><p>Astra... thanks for your reply... As I said, the equipment used by optometrists to do eye exams is all part of what makes gives glasses their appeal for me. There is something about having an eye test and the lenses gradually being adjusted to achieve perfect vision which is very appealing to me. Anyone else agree? Having my own trial frame and lens set, plus a chart, I feel I could start to replicate that at home, although it won't be the same having to make the adjustments myself. I think it is also to do with overcoming a childhood fear of these tests, which turned to a fascination in adult life. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2012, 11:27</p><p>Speedy </p><p>A suggestion for future girlfriends. You will find it somewhat easier to get a young lady to wear glasses for you if they don't have to force their eyes to see with them and if they don't get headaches from wearing them. You can even let them assist in the process by letting them pick out glasses they would want to wear. Get their glasses on-line from some of the many retailers that are out there. You will find very nice and functiona; glasses fro very little money. Have a look at "eyebuydiret.com" or "zennioptical.com"  </p><p></p><hr>

Holding phone/books further away from my face. Usual symptoms. Went for my first eye test in 15 years. Never had a prescription. At this stage, all I knew was that people wore glasses to help them see, and you could expect to wear 'plus' reading glasses in later life. And that was it. So my very first prescription was +1.00.  </p><p> </p><p>Early 2008, finally sorted out some +1.00 prescription reading glasses. Like most other newcomers, I wore my glasses infrequently and often secretly at home. I was surprised to see they made no different to my distance vision. I saw others take their reading glasses off, when not needed for reading glasses, but mine felt like all purpose correction ! Thought it odd. </p><p> </p><p>Six months later in mid 2008, I noticed a change. I could not read small print any longer with the +1.00 reading glasses. So went back to the optician and explained, also mentioned that I felt it was odd that I could see the television with the reader glasses on. Straightaway, my optician said "there's a reason for that!". So I had another eye test and my second prescription was +1.00 distance, add +0.75 for reading. Suddenly and quite unexpectedly I had a bifocal prescription. I was surprised. </p><p> </p><p>Three years later, I'm full time...  </p><p>  </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>prism bifocal</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2011, 08:51</p><p>To refer to the title of this thread I would like to share with you what turns me on about glasses. Well, it is not every kind of glasses, it is a very rare combination, at least in the country where I live: it's plus glasses with prismatic correction. First of all I love plus glasses, I like the reflection they provoke when seen from the side, I like the magnifying effect (although only up to about +4 dpt) and I love the executive bifocals which you don't see too often these days. Either they are multifocal or flat top bifocals, but not executive bifocals. </p><p>But what beats everything are plus glasses with prism correction. If you look at someone's glasses from an angle of about 45 degrees one eye is even more magnified because of the prisms (only happens with base out prisms as far as I know) and the other side actually seems to be in minus strengh, I could stare at this very rare sightings for hours, of course that is not possible and only happened four times in my life that I saw someone with that specific combination. What would top this would be, as I mentioned at the beginning of this short entry, prismatic plus-bifocals....oh my god!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Like lenses</b>&nbsp;19 Sep 2011, 23:08</p><p>Mr Jules </p><p>  Anyone that wears full time should always have a back up pair with them. </p><p>  When I was at -3.00 and full time,I had a lense pop out and the only way that I could drive home was to insert a piece of cut out cardboard in the missing lense side to block off that unfocused eye. </p><p>  At -7.00 where I am today that would be difficult.</p><p></p><hr>

Another intention is to show each lady as the person she really is. The last six ladies (Leonne, Connie, Christien, Bianca, Douce and Melissa) were professional models who reacted to a casting call which I submitted on Model Mayhem. I was quite surprised about the number of applications and the quality in terms of portfolio etc. But I will certainly return to work with amateur models after finishing the series with the professional models. </p><p> </p><p>Soundmanpt - re the word sexy: I never push any of my models to look sexy, but given the nature of many of their photo shoots elsewhere it's not surprising that their way of posing contains a sexy element. In fact, several models expressed that they valued the lack of pressure in that respect. The nice thing is that the word spread fast among the models (it's a small world and many of them know eachother) and the latest model told me exactly how the previous models had reassured her that there was no risk of "hanky panky". They call me "a classic photographer and a gentleman". It's nice to receive that sort of feedback. </p><p></p><hr>

However, sometimes I will go to the supermarket or other large retail-type store wearing a pair of plastic aviator-type glasses I bought on Ebay.  Their prescription is around +8 in the right eye, and +10 (with some prism) in the left eye.  I wind up wearing them low on my nose and looking over them most of the time just so I can see, but I do make it a point to push them back up and look right through them when I pass by and look at other people.  I also like wearing short-sleeve dress shirts and clipping a "classic" eyeglass case into the pocket.  You could say I have a bit of a nerd fetish. </p><p> </p><p>What I really really enjoy is getting up to the cashier, and I usually wind up dropping the change and/or the receipt after she hands them to me, due to the fact that I can barely see what's going on more than 3 inches from my face.  At that point she apologizes, and I get to tell her, "No, it's fine.  Don't worry about it.  {Pushing my glasses up on my nose and pointing to them.}  I just got these glasses yesterday, and I'm still getting used to them."  About half the time, cashiers will usually feel obligated to say, "Oh, those are nice!" </p><p> </p><p>I would love to gather the courage to ask my eye doctor to help me get into GOC.  I definitely want to start wearing some really high-power plus glasses, maybe even lenticulars, out in public.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2009, 22:09</p><p>R Ed. Thanks. I know what you mean about glasses. I love looking at myself in the mirror wearing them. I think we are lucky at the moment that there are so many really trendy frames to choose from. It makes it so much more exciting choosing them and now my optician has got one of these cameras that take your pic wearing new frames, you can put your glasses back on and actually see yourself in them, which was really really difficult before unless you stuck your nose more or less on the mirrors surface. yeah girls in glasses seem pretty popular these days. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2009, 09:07</p><p>Thanks Rachel, I think she's likely to leave her lenses in and just try and keep her head above water etc.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2009, 03:36</p><p>And. Well at her rx everything will look really really blurred without correction. She definitley will not be able to see any signs or notices around the swimming pool and she will not be able to recognize faces untill she gets really close to anyone. However as regards swimming she will manage OK. She will see the ends of he bath blurrily emerging as she does each length but nothing will look clear. Obviously she is familiar with the pool you regularly go to, but if she were to go to a strnge ones she would have big problems finding her way back to the changing rooms without her glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2009, 02:33</p><p>Rachel, wasn't me who metioned the goggles, I'm more interested in how you think my gf could cope without her lenses as you've been there and done it and I know she's reluctant to talk about the subject. Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2009, 22:40</p><p>And. My current rx is -11.75 &amp; -12.50 so if I wore -10 goggles close to my eyes it would probably be a big help to me for swimming. The problem is when you are severly myopic at quite a young age and swimming becomes difficult without glasses you tend to try and get out of going and become less keen on it. Really by the time I reached -6 to -7 I was starting to hate going swimming at school because I couln't see what I was doing properly. Then it just becomes more and more something you don't want to do. You start making excuses you have a cold or something or that it is your monthly period etc.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2009, 06:07</p><p>A few months ago there was a large collection of prescription swimming goggles on ebay ranging from -1 upto about -10 if I remember correctly.  Might be worh a look if interested in swimming.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2009, 05:46</p><p>rachel,what kind of script did you have when you were swimming at school ? Would my gf be able to manage anything without her contacts ?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2009, 03:21</p><p>Glenn. I know what you mean. But even if I had sports glasses they would still end up all splashed and stuff. I used to like swimming a lot, but it's not much fun when you can't really see anything properly. I suppose it's just one of the disadvantages of being of being a high myope. My friend who is long-sighted (but not too bad yet) copes quite well without her glasses when she's swimming. She reckons that most things in the middle distance are fairly clear. It's just if I get close up to her that she can't really see me properly. Also she seems OK seeing the pool edge when she gets in.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glenn</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2009, 01:08</p><p>My girlfriend also never takes her thick glasses off.She cannot see without them.She does go swimming with glasses on but wears her sport glasses that hook around her ears so they don't fall off.Her regular glasses slipped off once and we had a hard time finding them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2009, 23:20</p><p>Puffin. The girl at school you knew sounds rather like me. I used to do that. Take my glasses off, after I'd changed into my swimming stuff, then have to follow my friend to the pool. Then one time when she was off school poorly, I tied it on my own and slipped on the edge of the pool into the water and banged all my knees. I felt SO embarrassed I've always kept my glasses on since, but its no good in races because they get so splashed up and stuff. That's why I'm not allo that keen on swimming anymore. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2009, 17:01</p><p>I remember this girl at school, she was a pretty good swimmer but wore glasses all the time otherwise, getting from the changing room to the pool was interesting. Kind of "which way is the pool?"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2009, 14:12</p><p>I don't wear glasses but my gf wears contacts 24/7, her contact script is -7.5 &amp; -5.95. I've never seen her in glasses or without her contacts and I can tell she doesn't really like to talk about her eyesight. Can you remember what your vision was like with a similar script ?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2009, 10:41</p><p>And. Well no. I simply couldn't now even if I wanted to. I have a great boyfriend who knows how blind I am without my glasses. Actually he has never known me without glasses ever. Like he told me once, it doesn't matter to him how strong my glasses get as long as I can see clearly with them. If we go swimming I get into the pool with my glasses on and just hope they don't get too splashed!! That can be a nightmare. Actually I don't really go swimming all that much because of wearing glasses. I never, ever tried to go anywhere without my glasses even when i was a little girl because i could see so much better with them on! I'm lucky with my bf. I realise that.

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;28 May 2009, 22:49</p><p>Puffin. For the last 18 months I have been going for regular check-ups every six months on the advice of my optician. My mother likes to make me wait until my reminder comes even though I can usually tell I need an increase a couple of months before then. Obviously this is a bit of a pain for me but normal for someone my age everyones tells me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;28 May 2009, 22:43</p><p>RL. Thanks. Yes lots of us here get turned on seeing the "cut in" I reckon. It's just one of the amazing elements of strong minus lenses that advertises how short-sighted the wearer is, no matter how much he or she try and disguise the thickness of their lenses. Maybe myos aren't such a good idea for me after all. Just a personal observation.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;28 May 2009, 21:01</p><p>Hi Rachel Curious that with your immaculate GWG credentials you prefer men without glasses. Why do you think this is? Very surprising.  Pete</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;28 May 2009, 14:41</p><p>Puffin,  </p><p>These days I go for a check-up every two years or so. I must admit my last increase was a bit of a surprise. When I was in college I had huge increases, one year I went up 1.5D in six months. That was pretty scary, and the increases went on for another six or seven years but rarely more than 1D per year. By the time I was thirty, I was R -12, L -16. That's when I got contacts that were suppoised to slow myopic progression. It was called ortho-keratology and flattened the corneas a bit. Wore these for years and my contact prescription was around -9.5 and -11. But after years, these contacts were uncomfortable, so I gave them up. My glasses Rx turned out to be -8.50 and -12 at that time. But the thing with ortho-k is once you stop, the corneas return to their original shape. So now, I'm R -12.00 +.50 X 16, L -15.00. Since I don't know how high the myopia would have gone the first time, I held it off for ten years or so, and I really don't know where it will go now. So I've decided to enjoy being a glasses wearerer again. MAybe Cactus Jack would have an idea about how much the corneas might contribute.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;28 May 2009, 13:22</p><p>Rachel or RL or anyone else who wishes to answer, how long do you go before you realise your vision has changed and things start getting blurry again? </p><p>Do you instantly rush off to the optician or leave it till say a year is up? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;28 May 2009, 10:36</p><p>Rachel, </p><p>I noticed you like the look of the cut in with your glasses. Myodiscs do minimize that effect (I call it NHS, Narrow Head Syndrome, my face appears less than four inches wide through my full-field glasses) and cut down on power rings radically. So it's a bit of a trade-off. The other thing about the myos is that it's probably hard to tell the difference between -15D and -25D unless you know what to look for.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;28 May 2009, 02:04</p><p>Melyssa, I like looking at myself in the mirror in my glasses as well, and thinking, "Wow that girl looks so blind!" Then seeing my small eyes and the increasing 'cut in' at the sides of my face. Then the very obvious changes as my rx increases. Then looking down or sideways and seeing the power rings glinting. It's a definite turn on for me, no mistaking. Don't ask me why, it just is. I also love it when I get stronger lenses and people politely say, "Oh I like your new glasses Rachel, they really suit you." When really they are thinking, "Oh my God Rachel's had to get stronger glasses again." It's so cool.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;27 May 2009, 12:52</p><p>Rachel, </p><p> </p><p>I like to see how minimized my eyes look behind my largest glasses, which of course also yield the most in those ever-so-cool power rings.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;27 May 2009, 12:51</p><p>RL, </p><p> </p><p>I hope your RX doesn't skyrocket either.  Before I discovered this website a lot of many years ago, not only did I not know of anyone who became more myopic after 40, but I never knew of anyone whose RX was in negative double digits.  I always thought that -10 meant "guide dog time" (or whatever eyesight sports referees have).  :)  Thankfully it doesn't work that way. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;27 May 2009, 06:11</p><p>Millhouse. I get your drift. Like waiting sometimes is kind of the best part when you know you need a big increase. It really annoys me though when I'm out like with my parents for a meal and I can't make out the menu on the board. It's dead embarrassing because my mum has such good eye-sight and she says "Can't you even see that Rachel with your glasses on". And I have to say "I'm afraid not mum." Then I hate it when I can't make out people in town until they get closer up. </p><p>What really annoys me more though is when the optician won't give me the optimum amount of minus I need. It make me so mad when he says " I think we had better stop there Rachel or things will look so small you won't be able to make them out." The problem is he doesn't realise how much I enjoy the minification when I get a new increase! Still my distance is pretty good at the moment so I musn't whine. Let me know what happens with your increase soon.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>minus5 who luvs gwgs</b>&nbsp;27 May 2009, 05:03</p><p>Aubrac I did not mention that I normally wear a +2.00 add so increased this to +2.50 yes occasionally they come off for very small print</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Millhouse</b>&nbsp;27 May 2009, 01:57</p><p>- Rachel, </p><p>I guess Ill only know whats happening with my rx till the next time I go, probably in a few weeks or so. It may be that my eyesight has changed in some other way, perhaps thats why I have noticed some change. </p><p>I have high index Pentax lenses in my current semi-rimless frames which come up a lot thinner, about 30% or so Id say, even so the lens still look about 7mm thick on the outer edge.  I used to be very self conscious of that a while back but having been a lurker on Eyescene in the past and then a contributor on more recent occasions Im now ok with the look I have as I know there are people out there who seek out or have interests with higher rxs like mine (romantically or otherwise) And the Eyescene site is such a great help with confidence building and advice etc in many respects. </p><p>I also do enjoy of course the great vision I get with an accurate prescription! </p><p> </p><p>On another note I have one or two close friends that are in total denial about needing glasses and I must admit to finding it both funny but also a bit upsetting when we are in a restaurant during the evening and they cant read the menu without struggling. I had one male friend a while back who wore them for driving and TV etc, I wont ever forget the night we went to the Cinema and he waited until the lights went down before trying secretly to put them on so no one noticed! More recently he still does things like that  now- for example if we meet in a bar for a beer he just wont wear them and as  he cant see more than 10 feet away if Im there waiting for him he simply cant see me and I have to call to him or go over.  </p><p> </p><p>I have no children alas but the poor eyesight does run in the family, my father was about, as I recall, a -8 or -9 at least when he passed away. My mother has about -1.50 or so and my sister about the same I think. So its clear where I get my poor eyesight from I guess. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;27 May 2009, 00:52</p><p>minus 5 who luvs gwgs  </p><p> </p><p>I can understand a little extra minus for crisp vision but an extra 1.25 seems a lot. </p><p> </p><p>I know if I try my friends -1.00 glasses while wearing contacts everything is more blurred rather than clearer, I've also tried stronger contacts with the same result. </p><p> </p><p>At 54 how do find it for reading, is it still ok with the extra minus, or do you take them off.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;26 May 2009, 23:25</p><p>I think Melyssa increases in minus can possibly happen after the mid-forties like minus 5 who luvs gwgs says. Just small ones anyway. But my aunt is definitely hoping hers will stop, or at least steady up, once she gets to that age. She's only just turned 30 at the moment, so I suppose a lot can happen until then. Minus doesn't really worry me because I like the minification it gives.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>minus 5 who luvs gwgs</b>&nbsp;26 May 2009, 23:04</p><p>I suppose that the rate of increase depends on the individual My myopia has progressed by about one dioptre during my forties and early fifties (I am 54)I am now officially -3.75 and -5.00 with a little astigmatism but like Rachel I like the crisp vision of a little more minus so am wearing -5.00 and -6.00 .My girlfriend who is now 50 seems to have had an increase too of -0.50 and in a test last week with the auto refractor her worst eye seems to have crept up another half dioptre so she will begoing for a proper test soon She lives overseas so next time I see her hopefully she will let me treat her to another sexy pair of new glasses</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;26 May 2009, 13:50</p><p>Melyssa, </p><p>I just recently had an increase "in my forties" and I have a friend whose Rx is even higher than mine (I'm -12 and  -15. I think he is pushing -17) who had increases well into his sixties. Unusual, but apparently not impossible. I hope that doesn't happen with me, or I could turn out to exceed -20 or -25; yikes!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;26 May 2009, 12:51</p><p>Rachel, </p><p> </p><p>Not everyone gets an increase in myopia in that young age range known as the mid-forties.  :)  No one I know has had an increase past age 36, and that was myself, stabilizing at -9.00.  On the "plus" side, increases are very common.  I did not have an add until I was 48 (+1.50), and at 52 it jumped to +2.50.  Your aunt may be right, as no one I know has had a "minus in minus" either. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;26 May 2009, 10:14</p><p>Millhouse. Thanks a lot. You've got a pretty cool rx I must say. You probably consider me too young to give you my opinion, but its interesting to know that I can still expect small increases in my mid-forties. I suppose its like my aunt told me not long agao, once you start on the slippery slope there's no turning back. By the way do any of your kids need glasses for myopia?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mill house</b>&nbsp;26 May 2009, 07:24</p><p>-Rachel </p><p> </p><p>I usually have about a -0.25 increase with a minor change to the axis either way to tweek the prescription so to speak-I'm not sure exactly the axis bit of it means but do know it makes a big difference,I have minor astigmatism so that may be something to do with it. I have been told though that due to the aging process the rx may begin to reverse somewhat though I have nothing to indicate that yet. </p><p>I anicipate a -8/-7.25 or so when I next have to go as I'm aware I have lost some clarity when driving at nightime  , also my near vision is on the blink (no pun intended) so I guess a pair of bi-focals will be due aswell. </p><p> </p><p>I'm 45 years old,live in England</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;26 May 2009, 06:28</p><p>Millhouse. How much of an increase do you usually need every two years to achieve maximum sharpness and clarity? I'm just interested that's all. I also wondered what your age was, but if it's private its OK.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Millhouse </b>&nbsp;26 May 2009, 02:24</p><p>-Rachel, </p><p>Not really though when I do get a new prescription (about every year ot two) I do like the image clarity to be spot on and sharp otherwise I find it very annoying. Hence I tell the optician during the test- I have had before some quite poor prescriptions .</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;26 May 2009, 01:09</p><p>Millhouse. Are you hoping for more minus as time goes on like me? I love walking to the bus stop each morning and seeing all the leaves on the trees so clearly through my new lenses. The feeling is immense and I hate it when the clarity begins to wear off again. It just make me long for even more minus. Silly me I know, but i can't help it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;23 May 2009, 08:34</p><p>Milhouse. I usually carry my old glasses to school in case of accidents in sport etc. But normally when I'm out in town I don't. Like you, my old glasses are ok for emergencies to get me home.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Millhouse </b>&nbsp;23 May 2009, 07:14</p><p>-Rachel </p><p>As a -7/ -6.5 yes i agree, I have to keep spare glasses most places cus I cant see much at all if I'm bare eyed. I have a pair in the glove box of my car, a pair at work in my desk and a third pair here at home. Of course they are old rx's but they will do if I get caught out or have my main glasses damaged so as to make them unwearable in some way.I couldnt leave my apartment without them as it would be far to dangerous for me of course but I can at least (more or less) move about in the safety of my home. One time I had lense fall out and smash on the floor at a party and it was hell getting home afterwards.Do you keep spares ones around your own lifestyle or just hope it'll be ok should you have a breakage?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;22 May 2009, 22:49</p><p>And. My un-aided vision is now pretty pathetic. I'm still vaguely ok around the house without glasses, because I know where everything is, but there's no way I'd risk going out without them. I suppose by the time you reach -7.00 you really do feel helpless without glasses and even at -5.00 you are already pretty dependent on them. I'm now in the -11/-12 category so it really is panic stations if I can't find my glassses for some reason or other. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;22 May 2009, 15:23</p><p>Rachel, sorry if you've covered this before, but what is your unaided vision like.Can you remember how what you could/couldn't do as your script increased ? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;22 May 2009, 09:00</p><p>Aubrac. I don't really try to induce myopia intentionally. I simple enjoy the sharpness and clarity of being over prescribed, for as long as it lasts. Obviously this wears off after a few months, when your myopia is still increasing like mine. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;21 May 2009, 09:46</p><p>Like Lenses - I'm no expert but, given what I've heard here - you've achieved remarkable results.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;21 May 2009, 05:54</p><p>Like Lenses. My latest prescription is RE-11.75 &amp; LE-12.50. My last increase was "probably" quite a bit more than I really needed, but after a couple of weeks my eyes have adjusted really well to it. In fact when I take my glasses off at night, I definitely feel a lot more "helpless" than I did with my old glasses, so my myopia is increasing all the time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;21 May 2009, 00:30</p><p>Always interested in the subject of induced myopia but still feel it is impossible to induce myopia permanently. </p><p> </p><p>Has anyone who has induced myopia up to say -2.00, as Like Lenses has done, and then just not worn glasses for several weeks? I am sure their eyes would revert back to the 20/20 or whatever they were before.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Like Lenses</b>&nbsp;20 May 2009, 19:08</p><p>Rachel </p><p> I began wearing a pair of -.50 glasses full time instead of the +2.50 that Were prescribed for me. </p><p> I did a lot of reading with the glasses on, and held the print as close as possible. After a few months I did the same but now with -1.00. After about six months I knew I needed the -1.00 as everything was blurred without them. </p><p> Went for an exam and found that I needed -1.50 with -1.50 cyl. for each eye. Wore these and continued to hold the print as close to my eyes as possible. </p><p>  </p><p> The latest exam showed an increase in minus to 2.50 but now no cyl.. </p><p> I now wear -3.00 and do a lot of close work with them on, and I think that soon I will need another increase. </p><p> What is your prescription?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;20 May 2009, 07:19</p><p>R. Ed. I always do, each time I get them! It's really noticeable when you get quite a big increase. Also everything looks much smaller but really clear. That's what I like best.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;19 May 2009, 23:01</p><p>Like Lens. Another thing that turns me on, is when I go back to the opticians to collect my new glasses and watch the receptionist take them out of their packet for the first time. I look to see how much thicker they are and usually the girl says, "They have made a neat job of setting your lenses into the frames." In oher words, "they have done their best to hide the thickness!" It sounds so patronising, but I really love hearing it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Like Lenses</b>&nbsp;19 May 2009, 20:48</p><p>Rachel </p><p> Yes it is cool getting new glasses. I like the tall feeling, and sharp, and smaller images.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;19 May 2009, 11:29</p><p>I get to feel a real buzz when I first try new glasses on and everything becomes crystal clear and smaller again. Then when the receptionist says to me, "How do the feel?" "Brilliant" I usually reply, and I don't even want her to take them off my face to adjust the fitting. However the most amazing thing I find is when you actually walk out of the opticians wearing them for the first time and you feel so much taller and further away from the ground, especially if you've had a really big increase. Wow I love it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2009, 13:20</p><p>Lazysiow - I love helping my boyfriend choose glasses.. the way he gets so close to the mirror, the way he puts his own glasses back on between every pair, and best of all, when we go to pick them up and they take them out of the case and put them on him.. The last couple of times we've both been surprised (pleasantly!) by how thick the lenses are, and I always wonder what the dispensing assistant is thinking. It definitely spices things up a bit, the new glasses themselves and the fact that friends/colleagues will ask him about them, try them on etc, which is always interesting :-)</p><p></p><hr>

But you did remind me of an "All in the Family" episode where Gloria (Sally Struthers, who had long blonde hair) got a black, sugar-bowl style wig, which turned on her husband "Meathead" (Rob Reiner) so much that he wanted her to wear it all the time.

The original prognosis was that my partner would have a prescription of around -2 after the cataracts had been "zapped", however, on the day of doing her first eye the surgeon found that, as you correctly surmised, once the lens was removed, the correction was minimal. Appreciate the sympathy mate. it's what Eyescene is all about.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2009, 11:17</p><p>Did she have the lasr treatment rather than implants, Ed - the usual treatment post-cataract?

We sympahise. </p><p>I never cease to be amazed by the female belief that rummaging in the handbag, hauling out reading glasses and putting them on anytime you want to read something (not to mention taking them off and putting them away in the handbag again) is less bother than wearing bifocals or varifocals all the time. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ed</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2009, 02:55</p><p>Bad news readers. My better half has ended up having laser vision correction. It all started last year when she went for her regular eye examination, and she was told that she was developing cataracts. But no problem; modern technology would come to her rescue, and zap the cataracts, and correct her vision to as near to 20/20 as possible. No discussion allowed!(her vision was: Right eye Sph-9.5, Cyl +1.25, Axis110, Add +2.00Cyl. Left eye Sph-9.75, Cyl+1.25, Axis 65, Add+2.00Cyl. BUD 11mm). She had the treatment last month, and now has a pair of +1's for reading. Oh misery miserum! Gone are the days when we used to cuddle up in bed and she would put her glasses on me, whereupon she could see my eyes clearly against the backcloth of my blurred face. Gone is our urge too. She just doesn't look the same, those sexy rings in her lenses are no more. Whilst I have always been attracted by myopic women with strong glasses, she has always been attracted to men with beards. If the health gestapo make me have my beard shaved, I wonder whet will happen to our relationship?</p><p></p><hr>

I do have a particular fetish for black plastic frames, but even though I like the rectangles that are in now, my absulote fav is the "horn rim" type, like they wore in the 1950's (think Buddy Holly, who I LOVE as well).

<p><b>chevyluv</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2009, 17:47</p><p>I have been a browser of this site for some time but never posted. I think what turns me on the most is how they sit on the face and how they are adjusted behind the ear. Too tight and they dont look right, A little loose though and they will slip down ever so slightly. I absolutly love the nose pads especially when they turn yellowish or white you can usually tell they get worn alot then as body oils tend to discolor them. By the way my wife is a minus 7 and currently has 5 different pairs but thats another story</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>OnLooker</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2009, 23:52</p><p>Hi Emily...WOW what a description you've offered to our GWG loving souls!! It's just wonderful to see that women like you do exist!! But unfortunately we're nowhere near meeting them in real life... All of GWG lovers, at least a majority, have inherited of women enjoying perfect eyesight... May be one day!! </p><p>Thank you for letting us share those thoughts of yours! Keep it up please!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Like Lenses</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2009, 23:48</p><p>Emily </p><p> I had some glasses made up in my low RX of -1.50, with -1.50 cyl. for each eye. </p><p> I specified that I want them as thick as possible, and flat fronts. </p><p> They must have used a -9.00 lens blank, and ground all the power on the back surface. </p><p> They are CR39 and the outside edge is a little over 1/4 inch thick, and are flat in the front. I actually see better with them than with my regular lense glasses.  </p><p> They only have a small amount of cut in, and only two power rings, but friends have already commented that it looks like my eyes have gotten worse.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2009, 19:27</p><p>I get turned on by the physical changes that take place in my lenses each time my eyes get more nearsighted.  I like how the two surfaces have gotten less parallel as the spheres became more and more minus.  For awhile, the outer surfaces got flatter each time and the inner surfaces got more curved.  For the past 4 or 5 years, each new pair of glasses has kept the flat fronts while the innner curves get steeper and steeper, which has the effect of making the edges thicker. </p><p>I especially enjoy seeing the lens blanks before they're cut down to fit the frame.  Since -12 or so, the blanks have had a non-RX rim around the outside edge that gets slightly broader each time the spheres get stronger.  It's fascinating watching it broaden.  The blanks sort of resemble oversized myodisks, but the non-RX part gets cut away when they make the lens fit the frame.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;01 Feb 2009, 14:44</p><p>My friend who wears contacts 24/7 and has a script of -7.50 mentioned how she was worried about being thrown in the pool on holiday in case she lost her lenses. It was a great opportunity to ask about her vision.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katie</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2009, 15:34</p><p>Have been nearsighted since my 20s, but not too bad. Got my first add of +1.50 at age 38. Now at 42 it's up to +2.50. And yes my distance script has dropped. (I'm less nearsighted now than I was.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jeff Bacher</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2009, 02:21</p><p>I am a straight-forward individual. A beautiful girl behind the lenses is a pure distraction for me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Erin</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2009, 19:54</p><p>Got an add at age 41 on top of already being plus, but could have used it even earlier...without realizing it I was pushing my glasses further down my nose to see close up. I read somewhere that females become presbyopic earlier than males. And in my experience as well as friends and family this is definitely true! Also, having shorter arms makes it more likely for women to own up to bifocals earlier.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daisy</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2009, 15:26</p><p>I got a reading of add of +1.00 at 42.  Now I am at +1.75  and my - script has gone down since age 44.  I still cannot get used to not seeing things close up and seeing better in the distance!  Now I can use my add to see about 4-5 feet away with no discomfort.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2009, 14:10</p><p>I am minus 6 or 7 - I never know exactly - now aged 54. I held out without difficulty until I was 51 before small letters got too intolerable. I have a second pair of glasses which are one minus less than my normal glasses which I use for computer,reading music etc but I still find I can read print comfortably in my normal glasses with the exception of late at night. </p><p>Well at least one ageing phenomenon has not arrived early! Against that I had predominantly white hair in my early 40s - now needless to say, entirely white (what little there is of it:)) Pete </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John L</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2009, 12:54</p><p>My first presbyopia add for progressives was +1.75 in January 2007. </p><p> </p><p>However, as I was mainly a contact wearer I had bought my first pair of off the shelf readers about two years earlier to boost my near vision in difficult lighting. </p><p> </p><p>What I have found is that I tend now to wear my progressives around 80% of the time and contacts 20%. Whereas up to my first progressive prescription my wear was probably the opposite mainly wearing contacts. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2009, 11:12</p><p>Daisy, shall we ask those here who have reading adds, or single vision lenses, for presbyopia, if they would be kind enough to post their age when they were first prescribed them? </p><p>I'm a myope who was 43 when I first got a +1.50 reading add and swopped single vision lennses for progressives.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daisy</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2009, 10:35</p><p>Phil I would be interested in knowing more about that.  It seems to be the case in my experience.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2009, 01:22</p><p>Daisy, I have read somewhere that the average age at the onset of presbyopia is lower in women than men. Does anyone know why that might be? Not that I'm complaining: the more younger gwg presbyopes the better as far as I'm concerned!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Erin</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2009, 12:22</p><p>Daisy, I am glad that your new glasses are working well for you--like you say the line is really not very noticeable. Have you gone out in public with them yet? </p><p> </p><p>My husband was very supportive to me, seeing that I was not very happy with my stronger progressives. Thoughtful of him since he does not even need bifocals or progressives yet, and he is 49. (Five years older than me!) Although he didn't say it outright, I think he thinks the same thing about them being sexy... </p><p> </p><p>Aubrac, I would not push the lined bifocals on your wife if she has not even gotten there yet. At a low add the progressives worked fine for me--like Daisy says they are adequate. It's only now that my add got bumped up from +1.25 to +1.75, that I find progressives to be less adequate. </p><p> </p><p>It is hard enough to have to come to terms with getting older and losing your ability to focus, getting farsighted, etc. (all of which happened to me starting when I was 38) When your wife needs a reading add, let her start out with progressives and see what she thinks. If at some point she does not like them then she can do what I have just done. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daisy</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2009, 06:47</p><p>Aubrac, the progressives look better and are really adequate but the lined bfs are easier to work with.  I have been using the lined glasses much more than I thought I would.  It is a personal choice but the fact that my boyfriend likes them makes it easier to come out of the closet as a presbyope.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2009, 06:44</p><p>Hi Daisy </p><p>Good to hear that you like your new glasses and I'm sure you look great in them - you have a lucky boyfriend! </p><p> </p><p>As I said in my last post, I think my wife may need bifocals soon. If I can her to take a test and this is the result what do you see as the advantage of lined bifocals over progressives? </p><p> </p><p>If she does end up getting a pair, I'd like to suggest the right thing, some people seem to swear by progressives, others like the lined bifocals. For you, what are the pros and cons of each? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daisy</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2009, 13:57</p><p>I just picked up the glasses my bf picked out for me...a cute Lulu Guinness frame...with lined bifocals.

I know I can see better than I can in progressives...and now I know they are sexy.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2009, 01:04</p><p>Daisy </p><p>Yet another male who finds bifocals sexy. My wife now wears an old pair of glasses for distance and a stronger pair for reading. At 39 looks like bifocals will be the next step!!. </p><p> </p><p>I am having trouble answering your question as I don't really know why they are sexy, they just are.  </p><p> </p><p>Maybe something to do with the fact that there are many glasses wearers around but very few bifocal wearers and so there is a rarity value. Also it is like seeing someone wearing two pairs of glasses rather than one.  </p><p> </p><p>Pretty feeble explanations but if anything else comes to mind I'll post it. </p><p> </p><p>Let us know how you get on, I'm sure you'll look great wearing yours.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2008, 14:26</p><p>A couple of days ago I was having dinner with a date who also brought her sister + sister's BF along. The sister wasn't someone I immediately found attractive, but she did wear some low-but-getting-to-be-moderate minus lenses.  </p><p> </p><p>Partway through the dinner she took off her glasses because she could see her food better without them and her eyes went into that hurting/squinty/trying to focus mode. This was the best/worst I'd seen in awhile, while she was eating she struggled looking around, looked at us and then looked really sad at how bad her eyes had gotten. She then picked up her glasses and held them away from her face moving them back and forth sighing at the prescription before putting them back on the table, then decided to keep eating without them for awhile. This was a delight for me as she alternated between squinting and intensely trying to focus at things around her while she ate with some of the most delicious myopic looks I'd seen in a long time. </p><p> </p><p>I was embarassed at how much attention I was paying to her and how much she was turning me on, and I had to struggle really hard not to give myself away. I ended up taking my date home early saying that I had an early morning and rushed home, all I could really think of was her sister after that to which I had to erm.. relieve myself quite well :D In cases like that myopes can be a lot more attractive like that with their glasses off Oiiiiii... *sigh* :) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2008, 15:22</p><p>There is something so endearing about a strong, handsome man who needs to wear glasses full time.  It is not the glasses themselves that are the turn on, it is the effect they have when used by the right man.  For example, recently I walked into the office of a guy I'm sweet on and he was sitting at his desk on the phone.  This is someone who wears serious looking minus lenses.  I've never seen him without them.  Well, he had them off and was cleaning them as he talked.  They were just inches from his nose.  I knocked on the doorframe and he turned giving the most adorable squint in my direction and the glasses went on in one motion before I saw recognition flicker in his eyes.  Such a great moment.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2008, 09:11</p><p>Re Martyn: Exactly! I always consider glasses as accessories of the girl. It is a nice combination of both that makes me on with glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2008, 08:35</p><p>And it gets interesting to see those without glasses focusing so close onto the book when reading... I don't know why, but that seems to be a sign of myopic eyes and some time later they all became dependent on minus glasses, mostly at -2 range when they got their first prescription. But I find it more interesting to see one of them starts at -3.5 recently... because I know the friend so well except that I have no idea that she needs a prescription stronger than mine right from the first prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2008, 08:24</p><p>Now, what's turn me really on about glasses is that seeing my close friends having to wear glasses... because my uncorrected eyesight was never good since my early childhood, I find it curious that an individual once with perfect eyesight can become as blind as a bat within one or two years. There was a time when I was the only one having to wear glasses amongst my close friends (around 10),  just four years before. Four years before a friend of mine I had a friend asked me to borrow my glasses to see the board, and in this two years there were more of them needed glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Martyn </b>&nbsp;01 Oct 2008, 05:56</p><p>frank its not glasses that turns me on its the lady behind the glasses.

<p><b>Frank</b>&nbsp;01 Oct 2008, 05:01</p><p>Over the past 3 years my wife's prescription increased to the point that she's now almost always wearing her glasses. Best thing is when she wears them just before going to sleep, or early in the morning, when (un)dressing and walking around fully naked but for her glasses. A real turn-on and difficult for me to keep cool when seeing her like that!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cut-in UK</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2008, 15:51</p><p>VFL; you are an astute girl,with an IQ way above 100 ! Why would you ask a bunch of OO's how they would react to a woman in glasses in the situation you describe? ( I assume the male in this intended experiment is not one of us.) You need to ask yourself whether this is a genuine guy with the perception to penetrate your soul. If so, and he has had one or two encounters with you he will have done this already.If he likes what he already sees, it will make no difference. If he is a shallow and superficial person, he is not worth the effort of a quality female such as yourself! If you know his character, I suspect you you know the answer already. I suspect also, that very few men have the qualities to live up to your expectations ! Please tell me if you consider my assessment wrong. I am purely using intuition here. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>aviator -00-</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2008, 15:34</p><p>at my place of work (a large corporation with a big office building) there is a box in which people can put their unwanted glasses for charity. How I am tempted to delve inside it. Should I see any appealing frames with a decent music script, I would be sorely tempted to help myself. The question is how I handle this morally and practically. I could put a cash donation in its place, or maybe another pair of glasses from my collection which I no longer want. There is also the worry that the place where this box sits might be watched by a security camera and I wouldn't want to get caught 'stealing' from a charity box. Has anyone else had such a dilemma??</p><p></p><hr>

They fits her perfectly. She wear them for some minutes and said thet she saw quite well after wearing them a while. Christa asked if she wanted to wear them while go to a the restaurant, she had some more pair for wearing. So she does and it was one of the best evening for me watching my girlfriend in glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gino</b>&nbsp;07 May 2008, 03:18</p><p>Adalle, it's fun to read your contributions. I very seldom try on other people's glasses, but my girlfriend often does. I really like it when she takes off her glasses to try one someone else's, and she knows it. </p><p>Last week we spent the weekend at her sister's, who is also a glasses wearer. One evening in the bathroom she teased me by putting on her sister's spare pair, which are much stronger than hers, and keeping them on for about 15minutes!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;04 May 2008, 04:28</p><p>No Charlotte. I have perfect eyesight, but I like to try other people's glasses. The weird thing is I like trying women's glasses and not men's. Somehow, a woman entrusting me with her glasses makes me want more to try them on. I have sometimes spent about 20 minutes wearing a woman's low minus prescription pair of glasses, indoors of course, or even more time if it's during sex. </p><p>About two years ago I was dating a woman who was an OO and although she didn't need glasses, she had purchased a pair with no prescription lenses (clear glass) and we used to wear them in turns.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Charlotte</b>&nbsp;03 May 2008, 22:48</p><p>Adalle </p><p>Do you wear glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;03 May 2008, 05:03</p><p>Since my early high school years I remember myself been attracted by girls with glasses. Almost all of my girlfriends needed glasses and the ones who didn't need to wear, liked to try glasses on or had several pairs of sunglasses. All those who wore glasses were in the -2 to -4 range, never lower and never higher.  </p><p>I can't say I ever was very attracted by high prescriptions, but mostly I was fascinated by the interaction with the glasses. Putting them on, cleaning the lenses, readjusting them, pushing them up, playing with them by lowering them to give me a sexy look, etc. </p><p>Almost all of my girlfriends knew I liked to see them with glasses and most of them took advantage of it, whenever they could. They had them on when having sex and a couple of them liked to put them on me or didn't have a problem wearing them over their contacts, when they didn't have enough time to take the contacts off. </p><p>But the best ones were, when I started dating them to find out a week later that they needed glasses. This happened twice and of course I convinced them to wear their glasses more often ad gradually they ditched the contacts. </p><p>The funny thing is that almost all of my female friends need glasses, some of them reaching even a -11 prescription. Whenever I see them with glasses, I love to see them interact with them. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra myopicblur</b>&nbsp;02 May 2008, 02:55</p><p>I will be curious when I heard someone without glasses complaining their eyesight. I expect the one complaining might need presciption lenses very soon. Amongst those I have observed, most of them did, while a few did not. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra myopicblur</b>&nbsp;02 May 2008, 02:47</p><p>Re Sourgrapes: When the prescription is -6, -8, -10, -13 or more, it does add a whole other dimension of charm, somehow very different from that of weak prescriptions. </p><p> </p><p>For -4 and more: They often have interesting minifications, power rings, strong cut-ins, often thick lenses, a "heavy" look, and often substantial reflection. </p><p> </p><p>For -4 and less (up to around -1): Weaker minus prescription gives almost a totally opposite kind of fetish, mainly on the thin lenses, mild cut-ins, sometimes exceptional small or large frames. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Willy</b>&nbsp;24 Apr 2008, 06:27</p><p>Actually a presbyope, unless she has some hyperopia to be detected at a real exam.  Anyway, saw the glasses last night; they are kind of a coral color frame, very nice.  She did not wear them much, though, other than to show me....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Willy</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2008, 13:08</p><p>I did not realize how soon I would have more to report... turns out my wife had lunch with a friend today and the subject of her needing reading glasses came up.  Evidently the friend said something along the lines of "it's about time" and convinced my wife that they should go get her some glasses after lunch and the friend could help her pick out frames.  Apparently there is a store near where they had lunch that carries some fairly stylish readers (in other words, not the CVS) so they went in there and my wife tried glasses on and picked a pair along with a nice case.  I asked what they were like, and she said that they are half glasses so she can look over them.  I also asked what strength they were and she said they were +1.75.  She said she had worn them to read a magazine after getting home and before picking up the kids from school and that it was a big relief.  She also said that after she took them off, she found she could not focus on anything up close for several minutes.  I told her that the more she wore them the more she would need them, but that there comes a time when you have to do what you have to do, and at least she did not have to wear bifocals like me (yet).  I told her I could not wait to see them and my plan is to reveal to her (as if it were a surprise to me) that there is something arousing about her in glasses....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Willy</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2008, 09:24</p><p>What turns me on today is that last night marked a turning point in my encouragement of my wife to get glasses.  We were learning to program our new TiVo box (remote and manual with small print!) and she was having trouble, so I produced my old +1.5 readers and asked if she would like to try them.  She grudgingly agreed and admitted they made it much easier for her to see up close.  She agreed that she needs reading glasses and said she would make an appointment with an eye doctor (but since she is often busy with kids during the day and does not have a current eye doctor, this may take further persistence on my part; my eye doctor is downtown where I work and not a convenient option for her).  I told her in the meantime she should use my old glasses when she needed to or buy a pair at the drugstore.  I let the matter drop after that but will continue to report any new developments...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2008, 12:02</p><p>Oh, P.S., of course it's really neat when the rx is SO high that the lenses are the high-index extra-sparkly kind and STILL thick! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2008, 12:01</p><p>As EHPC says, there are few things hotter than rectangular black plastic frames, though I must say I do fancy a few other styles, as well. Variety is the spice, and all that. But if everyone is going to wear the exact same frame (which, of course, they are, humans being the copycats that they are), I can't think of a better one for it to be then the black rectangles that are now (and hopefully will be for some time!) in fashion. It's a great time to be a glasses-watcher! All except for this high-index stuff, but I even kind of like those sometimes, those thin(ish) but obviously powerful lenses, their whole little being absolutely jam-packed with power rings, with a little miniature crystalline world visible when looking through them, can be most beautiful! Especially when the edges are polished, the high-index, high-minus lenses often seem to have more sparkle to them than the thicker, lower-index ones, though I don't know why, has something to do with the increased density of the high-index lens I suppose, but I think there's some physics involved in figuring out that little mystery, and I never took physics so... And when I look at the face of a person wearing such glasses, I always smile to myself thinking "I bet you really think you have me fooled, don't you? You think because you're lenses are so thin that I can't tell that they're quite a high prescription. Well, sorry, but you forgot to take into account (or probably more likely, couldn't do anything about) that I can still see those lovely white rings when you tilt your head, the bite-out of the sides of your face, the minification of your obviously (no matter how hard you try to hide it!) very myopic eyes".  </p><p> </p><p>I ALWAYS make passes at guys who wear glasses (especially the sparkly ones!), Marie </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SZ6</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2008, 07:38</p><p>Cut-in UK, </p><p> </p><p>She actually brought up the idea of getting more pairs of glasses, including at least one pair specifically for sex! I imagine the "sex" pair would be some sort of large yet stylish frame with CR39 lenses. She could probably get a good 5-6mm of edge thickness in such a frame. </p><p> </p><p>I think we'll probably let ourselves explore and enjoy the glasses fetish before we try GOC.

<p><b>Cut-in UK </b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2008, 23:15</p><p>SZ6, I add my congratulations to those of Lazysiow. It's always a triumph for an OO to 'OUT' themselves and discover their partner is an instant 'convert' who is willing to embrace the culture. As a -5, she will be able to get, at modest cost,CR39 equivalent low-index lenses to fit into a stylish frame of her choice, for 'sex in spex' or just going about at the weekends. Of course if you were both to embark on GOC with a really comfortable contact like Acuvue2, the opportunities are limitless ! </p><p> </p><p>Are you based in Europe, or 'across the pond' ?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cut-in UK </b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2008, 22:40</p><p>Nick, this sounds like a job for 'optical4less'. Check out their website, especially 'special making' department.  </p><p>To answer your questions,  </p><p>1. if you want to increase 'sphere value' a lot depends on your age; most people can tolerate up to 1.00 extra minus dioptre for distance, but more if you are younger than say 20 years. The figures for 'cylinder/axis' remain the same.  </p><p>2. On the net you just have to fill in your requirements, and don't normally need a prescription. However stick with o4l who technically are very precise, and a reputable site. Get to know about lenses and bifocal styles and get it all planned BEFORE placing the order. </p><p>3. o4l does low power myodisc as well as progressives/bifocals, and will, if requested, speak to you about your requirements. Obviously it costs, especially the myodisc, but the normal bifocals/progressives are extremely good value.  </p><p> </p><p>They have also supplied me with a high quality product for GOC. I can think of no-one better, but ask around if you want to check other makers as well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SZ6</b>&nbsp;14 Apr 2008, 11:08</p><p>Well, over the weekend I bit the bullet and told my girlfriend about my fetish for women in thick glasses... it went better than I could have possibly hoped for. She was completely receptive, intrigued, and even turned on herself by the idea. Both of us have, in the past, acknowledged having a "thing" for people in glasses, so telling her this felt more like playing on an existing theme than broaching something completely new. </p><p> </p><p>She is naturally a -5, so she is used to wearing strongish glasses. I'm -10ish myself, so she was able and very willing to wear my glasses while we fooled around, without straining her eyes toooo too much. One time when we were playing with this new discovery, she wore an old pair of mine - huge frames from the 90s with CR39, half-inch-thick lenses - and said she loved wearing them. </p><p> </p><p>The great thing is that the thick glasses thing fits PERFECTLY into our sex life! Our interests and fetishes are totally complementary already, and this new thing melds perfectly with our existing fantasies and themes. I even broached the possibility of GOC as a way for her to wear really thick glasses but still be able to see through them without straining - as well as making her feel like she really needed the glasses to see... and she was receptive to that, too! </p><p> </p><p>It was like our (already very good) sex life got taken to a whole new level...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cut-in UK </b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2008, 15:13</p><p>Rayjess; for those really into glasses, and for absolute authenticity, GOC (glasses over contacts is 'the thing'. Serious prescriptions, balanced by contact lenses to a bespoke formula, give you the 'look' of real glasses. Planos do not convince people, even in nice frames.</p><p></p><hr>

Over the years, I've fallen in love with a few girls mostly because of their look in glasses but have mostly hurt them inadvertantly because the decision was not based on whether we fit as people. All the "right" ones so far have been (cursed lol) with perfect eyesight but even then as we drift apart I've not yet gotten to the point where started needing glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>That's the one thing left that I still have to wait for, the love of my life and the one day when she starts squinting and the day my heart jumps out of my mouth when I have to go out with her to pick up frames. Ahh for you guys that have experienced this I envy you :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DWV</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2008, 02:40</p><p>0.25 of astigmatism, or anything, is very little.  The left and right axes add up to 180 degrees, which is fairly normal.  Something to do with how symmetric something is that causes astigmatism. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ES-Visitor</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2008, 00:32</p><p>My wife's astigmatism is 120 at +0.25 (R) and 60 at +0.25 (L). Any hints into what that really means?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2008, 14:05</p><p>I understood that the angle of astigmatism is also a factor. I have the smallest amount -0.25 at 140 degrees and even with my exceptional aspheric contact lenses, I can still tell the difference. I was once told that oblique angles of astigmatism, such as mine, are the most difficult to correct. </p><p>More than that, I don't know.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Willy</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2008, 09:18</p><p>The issue of degrees of astigmatism, and compensating for it, is an interesting one.  Based on my own experience, I think hyperopes can to some extent compensate for astigmatism.  The astigmatism in my left eye is now -1 (versus a +1.5 sphere) but when I was younger I could see 20/20 out of that eye, so either the astigmatism developed over time, or perhaps it was always there, but in focusing to overcome the hyperopia, I was somehow focusing different amounts on different axes?  </p><p></p><hr>

This happened with my wife when at age 34 she got glasses for the first time. </p><p> </p><p>She had a mild plus scrip but I really hoped she would go FT as her glasses were for both reading and distance. I used to try and make her wear her glasses for TV and when we were out but unfortunately it had the reverse effect and made her wear them less, saying she didn't want to become dependent on them. </p><p> </p><p>Four years on and two prescription changes later, I have learned to back off and not become obsessive but just enjoy when she does wear her glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Now at 39 she is wearing them more but still not FT. One small recent story concerning this - my wife was becoming a British Citizen and to finalise this we had to attend a citizenship ceremony in the evening at the town council offices. I picked her up early from work (where she usually wears glasses all day)and was just a little disappointed when she came out bare-eyed. Despite this I knew it was her evening and she must be as she wanted. </p><p> </p><p>The drive was about one hour and soon she started to carefully brush and get her hair ready, then she carefully applied the full make-up, filed and varnished her nails and changed her top. </p><p> </p><p>Then she looked in the mirror making sure everything was ok and said, 'Which glasses shall I wear, the red ones or the brown ones?' </p><p> </p><p>My heart suddenly beat faster, hands gripped the steering wheel harder than needed, and in a voice I tried to make sound normal said, 'Darling, I think the red would be really nice'.  </p><p> </p><p>The red glasses she rarely wears, they are dark brown on the outside, red on the inside, with red strips at the hinges. </p><p> </p><p>We had a lovely evening, glasses on all the time, and some nice pictures for the record.

<p><b>ES-Visitor</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2008, 03:35</p><p>Despite all the problems this attraction for women with glasses and especially high myopes with strong glasses has created with my wife along years now, I still keep to it and enjoy it in my private and intimate times when I'm alone especially on the web. My wife decided to ignore the matter completely, she used to wear some very low prescription glasses for a very mild hyperopia mostly to please me but then she decided she wouldn't do it as she doesn't really need them to see and that she's not to please that way (ie with glasses), she sustains I have to love her as she is and not as I would like her to be (needing glasses)... So i'm alone now in trying to satisfy that attraction, i'm not betraying my wife in any manner but I'm just enjoying sightings and different stuff about women in glasses. Sometimes I just have a glance at the colelction of readers my wife had bought to play with and to wear from time to time on the computer as she has some troubles after a long time in front of the screen. Now she has kept them aside and she's not using them any more. I see her squint at times when using the computer and i start wishing she'd get back to glasses... But she's not to... When we go out shopping for example, it's hide and seek game as she knows i'm all the time spotting women with glasses so she tries to ignore the fact while I try to avoid her taking me red handed... It's a game where i'm winning and at times she spots thje girl for me and truns around to see if i'm looking while i'm not aware of her...then she attracts my attention and I end up looking with her believing that i haven't seen the scene... Interesting game... On TV as well, every time there's a woman in glasses she glances at me secretly to see if i'm interested... really looking forward to the day when she'll have to wear glasses  herself. She's 34 now and her mild hyperopia hasn't increased at all...Or else she's hiding the fact and still able to accomodate... That was my story my friends...</p><p></p><hr>

He has been posting for many years. Many of us consider him an important member of the group because he has accomplished many "impossible" things, that astound his eye doctors, in spite of his vision problems.  </p><p>Many of us admire his spirit and tenacity. In a recent post, he was somewhat upset that he couldn't play goalie on his soccer team that day, because the weather had turned bad and he was concerned that he might fall and damage his new glasses. What astounds the doctors is that even with extremely high prism, he cannot fuse the two images into one.  He is able to process the two individual images and switch from one eye to the other to track the ball as it is aimed at the goal. The ball is simply not allowed to get past him, period.

Everything looked so sharp and clear in glasses! Without glasses I could not see the car plate clearly just 6-8 feet away, but with glasses I could see them 20-25 feet away, for example. It was the conscious rejection of wearing my glasses full-time that drives me curious in minus glasses, as well as the wearers. </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h282/dasneravo/faces/me.jpg" target="_blank">http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h282/dasneravo/faces/me.jpg</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ed</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2007, 03:29</p><p>Chris. You encapsulate my views on the OO stimuli, the majority of my girlfriends have had a minus prescription though. The stimulation for me is more pronounced the higher the prescription, and this has been so since manhood arrived in my teens. For me the attraction is part of my life. I too would have dearly liked to have been myopic to a level of around -10, and like you, have thought (or maybe fantasised) about surgery to achieve this goal. Having a website like this enables us to help to understand our feelings on this somewhat rare subject.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Highmyope</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2007, 11:25</p><p>Very interesting--I too have found that the intensity of my "OO-ness" has paled over time. I had written it off to a function of age, but I think what's been suggested here is the better answer: the ability to do GOC (and to find the "handicap" isn't as severe as I'd assumed); to get any glasses/contacts I want--no questions asked; to see pics of women in strong rx's anytime--in short, everything the Internet has provided, and which I've long thought of as a godsend--has sort of reduced it all from something rare/exotic/forbidden to something (almost) ordinary. </p><p> </p><p>To be sure, I still get a "tingle" when someone takes a long look at my strong lenses as I do GOC; and there will always be something--for lack of a better description--*emotionally* satisfying about it. (We'll let a team of psychiatrists sort that one out :) ). So, yes, I still have an interest, still get a thrill to see a truly major rx "in the wild," still enjoy GOC'ing.... But still....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>benn</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2007, 09:05</p><p>I agree with Chris. My fear would be that after surgery I couldn't correct. I know people who can't and have given up driving at night due to lasik.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chris</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2007, 08:46</p><p>cut-in. I've always had a healthy, "normal" sexual response to women with perfect vision, the majority of my girlfriends over the years have had 20/20. However the level of arousal I get from OO related stimuli is more intense. I've always considered it an extra/add on/bonus, even a gift. My attraction though has primarily been due to the "handicap" conferred on a woman by her myopia and hence I've always preferred higher prescriptions. My experiments with GOC plus my relationship with my myopic girlfriend have revealed that even very high prescriptions are not really the handicap I perceived them to be. Glasses and cls are so readily available and there's practically never any reason to be without correction. A myopic woman just puts her glasses on or cls in and she's as able as someone with 20/20 vision. Even without correction my gf can do most things, she's not in any way helpless. Doing GOC day in day out has taught me that "needing" strong glasses is really just a minor inconvenience and soon becomes a way of life. I think these things are what has caused the diminishment in intensity of my OOness. </p><p>Of course I still turn my head whenever I see a gwg and almost subconsciously assess her rx. I still love the look of girls in glasses (although to me the appearance was always secondary to the degree of myopia). I don't think my OO tendencies will ever disappear completely, they're too ingrained. It's really just a case of familiarity breeding contempt I think. One thing I do still experience though is something I can only describe as envy for gwg's. Maybe it's a kind of deep respect or empathy for the way they handle their myopia, I don't know, it's a weird feeling. As such, I do wish I was much more myopic myself, the one thing GOC doesn't allow me to do is experience the permenance of severe myopia and I think that's where the envy comes in. Maybe the next (and final) stage in my OO journey is to become highly myopic myself by surgery. I've thought about it for a while and I'm sure I could convince a doctor to carry out the procedure, the only thing I need to do sort is the logisitics.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;18 Dec 2007, 22:42</p><p>Well I haven't been lucky enough to find anyone I would bare my soul about it to yet. That's really the last frontier for me, the other thing is the vulnerability aspect. I have dated a few girls with small-moderate rx's but most of them are very closeted and protective about their eyesight and always prefer contacts with me.

<p><b>cut-in UK </b>&nbsp;18 Dec 2007, 15:06</p><p>So, Chris, where do you go from here? Interesting that the 'buzz' has diminished, having bared your soul to this fascinating lady. Surely, it doesn't alter your basic view of myopic women. You need a new stimulus, but what will it be? </p><p> </p><p>How deep was your relationship, and how significant do you feel the glasses were in a 'sexual way'? Did they fuel the desire or were they the 'icing on the cake'?    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chris</b>&nbsp;18 Dec 2007, 13:41</p><p>Lazysiow, it was very interesting to read what you wrote about glasses/gwgs/myopia etc losing their appeal. I'm starting to find that myself now. I've been into gwg's in a big way since I was maybe 8 or so years old (I'm now 43) and as time has moved on I've gradually developed my interest and moved onto, as you put it, "bigger highs". The internet of course has accelerated this development over the last few years to the point where for the last two years I have been full time GOC. I'm mildly myopic naturally but I do GOC using glasses with an rx of around -9. This has become so utterly normal and run of the mill to me now, it's how I see. I don't have glasses in my correct rx and instead of putting glasses on in the morning, like normal myopes, I put cls in AND glasses on, it's part of my routine. </p><p>There was one "holy grail" of the OO experience for me though and that was that I've never had a girlfriend with a significant rx. This changed in April last year when a woman called India wrote on this very site. I wrote back about my OOness and after a while we became very close, exchanging emails every day, then onto phone calls and webcam IM's. It remained like this for a long time as she lives in the US and I live in the UK and we both have partners. However we met up for the first time earlier this year in a neutral country. She's wonderful, everything she said she was and more and I adore her. My feelings for her are completely independant of the fact that she's a gwg (-8/-8.5). Having slept with her and experienced a myopic woman first hand for the first time, I honestly feel that my OO tendencies have dwindled somewhat. Her myopia just didn't play much part in my level of arousal and I feel I'm getting to the point where I'm almost "cured". She knows all my deepest OO secrets and has been incredibly supportive and I owe her an incredible amount. Don't get me wrong, I still love looking at gwg's and get a real buzz from doing so but like you say, a lot of the mystery that captivated me for so long has gone.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Serna</b>&nbsp;18 Dec 2007, 04:28</p><p>Glasses... well I was fascinated in them simply because my habit of observing their lenses... strong or weak, minus or plus, etc. I simply could not understand what... sexual appeals? Maybe I myself looks  average and wearing old-fashioned metal frame and I see no point... that is glasses fetishism, right?  </p><p> </p><p>Actually what catches my eye is often the cut. I think I am a bit strange because I often avoids those with too much cuts. Well , this is subjective. But probably around -6-7 is the maximum for me. Yes, I dislike too strong minus prescription as they seemed unhealthy... or aroused me of induced myopia or glasses fetishism... both of which I do not enjoy at all. </p><p> </p><p>For me, glasses is used for helping people to see clearer... As far as I know, strong myopia is terrible and I think we should get rid of them... consider lasik surgery, I think.  </p><p> </p><p>Um, actually I like some gwgs with moderate minus lenses (around -4 to -7)... I have just seen an image of an gwg and I quite like it... I could not easily estimate its prescription from this angle, but I expect it is somewhere between -3 and -7... and I guess it is most likely around -4 to -5.5. </p><p> </p><p>Well, I like this kind of "peeping"... peeping other's glasses... for many times I feel a bit regretful not to peep someone in more details... of course, I would not take photos of them unless they ask me to do so.  </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.vaad.lv/images/images/dscf2547.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.vaad.lv/images/images/dscf2547.jpg</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2007, 10:28</p><p>Hm after an almost 10 year fascination I think glasses are losing their sexual power over me.

Going from the fascination for them at an early age, to getting the first pair of "clear lensed" glasses to play pretend, to getting some of my own and then now with the advent or cheap online retailers, finally seeing through every type of lens etc. A big part of the mystery is gone :( and that was fueling a big part of the sexual exhilaration. Maybe GOC might make it fresh again, I've considered it but really can't stand putting anything in my eyes. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VFL</b>&nbsp;13 Dec 2007, 15:44</p><p>Oh, Jennifer! </p><p> </p><p>I agree wholeheartedly.  A pair of well chosen glasses sets off a man's face making him look more "definite." </p><p> </p><p>Of course there is the vulnerability factor.  A big, strong man with that little "need."  Yeah, that'll do the trick for me.   </p><p> </p><p>There was one guy I knew who was a diver. He was the live in boyfriend of one of my friends.  I was at their place when a UPS package arrived hodling his new mask.  You guessed it.  There were prescription lenses mounted in it.  He also had prescription wraparound sunglasses for biking.  (He was a one of those ironmarathoner people.)  They had a little clippy thing that looked like a pinznez that you could take off or put on.  When they were on you couldn't really tell since the lenses were kind of mirror like.   </p><p>No contacts for him.  I can't remember why and didn't ask.  I never questioned my men too much about their eyesight until recently.  It was always best to just observe what they did naturally.  Lately I've been asking about sight in a commiserative way.  It's amazing how they open up.   </p><p> </p><p>Men are dying to talk about their vision correction.  At least that's my experience.  </p><p></p><hr>

From now on, and not just on Eyescene I  be open and honest in my appreciation, fetish and love for females in glasses in my day to day life.  Apart from my last gf (who was ,now that I recognise it, an OO herself) no one has known of my interest, which ,if Im honest, has been there for some time.

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2007, 12:27</p><p>Cactus - on the whole I guess that's true at a young age. When, as I was, you get to be driving and don't feel confident you can see as far as you should you certainly get the feeling that kind of vision isn't normal!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dependancy Factor</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2007, 05:57</p><p>The most important turn on to me is the dependancy factor.  I find it very attractive when a woman needs glasses but either doesn't have any, or just doesn't wear them, and it results in a visible change in her such as squinting, disorientation, dizziness, etc.  I love hearing women talk about getting glasses, or trying on other people's glasses too.   </p><p> </p><p>That's why this site is such a pleasure for me.  While there are alot of people here who want to see women wear their glasses, I feel like a second cousin to the family here, someone who enjoys a similar but different attraction.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2007, 14:49</p><p>Clare, </p><p>Vision occurs in the brain and I suspect tht your brain is used to having two similar (in clarity) images to work with.  With only one eye corrected the brain is having to work much much harder than usual to process the blurry image from the uncorrected eye. </p><p>When you are not wearing any correction the images are almost equally blurry and the brain just does the best in can with the two blurry images.  If you wore correction for only one eye for an extended period, your brain would likely learn to ignore the blurry image and the discomfort would disappear. </p><p>The human visual system was designed to work with two good images and that is where it works best. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2007, 13:14</p><p>Serna - I hope I don't misinterpret your post. What was the difference in Rx that you experienced when you were a child?  confused by your reference to -3. </p><p> </p><p>Cactus Jack - do you know why it would be more comfortable for me to be uncorrected (-2.75 + -3) than the -2.75 corrected and the -3 uncorrected?  I'm surprised that the level of discomfort is greater with one eye corrected. Two uncorrected eyes would have seemed a better option had I not known better.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Serna</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2007, 07:38</p><p>I think the difference between plano and -3 is even less tolerable for me... for the much larger difference I have experienced before lasik surgery I merely felt that one of my eyes seems "almost blind", and I was quite accustomed to that. (I was like that since I was 6 years old) However, the disturbance from -3 could be more significant as I would expect some sort of "double acuity" feel, which is weird but nonetheless bearable (could be subjective), unless there are astigmatism in one or both eyes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nicole</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2007, 14:06</p><p>R Ed </p><p>Thanks for your kind comments. My main issue is that the -1 eye looks like there is no prescription and the -3 obviously looks stronger. I guess your sister in law has the same issue and it's great that she doesn't have a problem. I hate people to try my glasses because it's nearly always that they say that one eye is really strong. I also think the difference makes the weak prescription look like its just clear glass. I learnt this week I can't wear contacts so am stuck with it for now. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2007, 13:39</p><p>R Ed - it's not comfortable to be plano and -3. I only know because in the past I've lost a contact lens on a couple of occasions and the effect was to make me corrected to 20/20 in one eye and -3 in the other. There is some visual disturbance in the distance which is tolerable for a short time, but what I found most taxing was reading.  That was pretty difficult but not impossible.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>R Ed</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2007, 06:52</p><p>Guest, </p><p> </p><p>My sister-in-law wears full time. She has not commented re her vision with out glasses but I suppose she'd have a double image. </p><p> </p><p>Sue, </p><p> </p><p> You sound totally well adjusted viz-a-viz your vision: after some time I think Nicole will also be. What is the alternative? One's vision is simply a fact of life and one selects the preferred alternative to correct it from the options. Nicole would prefer CL's, but apparently that is not an option.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sue</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2007, 00:29</p><p>I have a similar problem to Nicole. My rx is R-12.50 L-15.25 a difference of -2.75. Whilst i can see the difference between my lenses, I am not sure that most people would. Unless they were really looking, or I had mentioned the difference to them. But it has certainly never embarrassed me, and I never mind speaking about my glasses to anyone that asks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2007, 22:27</p><p>R Ed </p><p>How des your sister getby with an Rx like that, does she just wear glasses for dstance or fulltime?  Did she ever mention what her vision is like without glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>R Ed</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2007, 19:01</p><p>Nicole, </p><p>  From the "Induced myopia" thread you noted your Rx -3 &amp; -1, so I now better understand your issue- one lens is triple the other. </p><p>  My sister-in-law has a similar problem- 1 lens is ~ -3, the other is plano. She has never complained about people asking questions, but she has ~30 years of glasses experience (no CL's). I've heard her draw attention to her situation first; she mentions her good eye and her lazy eye. </p><p>  As time passes I hope you'll have a higher comfort level and reduced concern.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2007, 14:12</p><p>Nicole, </p><p>I have a 3.5 diopter difference between my eyes. My prescription is R -11.00, -.50 X 017, L -14.75, -.25 X 005, so the difference is a small percentage of the total, but it is noticible. I've decided it looks a bit exotic and that I like it. But I have no other choice, why not enjoy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>R Ed</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2007, 13:58</p><p>Nicole, </p><p> </p><p>  What sort of comment(s) is most unwelcome? I suppose any but what is worst. I'd like to ask how different the Rx is in the two lenses but I'm pretty sure that might be exactly what you wouldn't like people to ask. Would you mind telling your age? </p><p>  I'm nearsighted and mine are 1.50 D different; I can't recall anyone ever commenting; so it is mainly a nuisance trying to read without them- closing one eye works best.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nicole</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2007, 13:43</p><p>From someone who has a big difference in the two eyes, I hate it! I feel like people are always staring because my lenses look very different. And I don't let anyone try them anymore because they always comment.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Zorab</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2007, 15:51</p><p>whatever the script, there is more fun in looking when you can see past the temples of people's frames. This fashion for wide temples is not only ugly, but the wide arms acts as a very annoying screen against those of us who like peering into people's lenses from the 3/4 rear view.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Visitboy</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2007, 14:41</p><p>Hi Zorab, </p><p> </p><p>I do the same on the London Tube. There was a good-looking City guy standing in front of me on the Tube today. I thought at first that his frames were black, but they were actually dark green. Small metal frames that suited him nicely. </p><p> </p><p>Best of all, he was low minus in the left eye, but moderate minus in the right. </p><p> </p><p>Anyone else like it when one lens is visibly stronger than the other?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Zorab</b>&nbsp;09 Oct 2007, 09:53</p><p>Serna: I enjoyed reading your postings (apolgies for the slow response). You are not the first person to have mentioned the high incidence of myopes in HK/China. I live in London, and travelling on the tube gives plenty of opportunities to observe gwgs, especially when you are crammed next to each other during the rush hour. You could never normally get that close to a complete stranger. Of course you have to develop trechniques to look without appearing to stare. Standing behind someone, to get the rear view is often best.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Serna</b>&nbsp;01 Oct 2007, 03:34</p><p>I live in Hong Kong. </p><p> </p><p>It is really fortunate for me to live (and work) in a city where relatively high proportion of population of both sexes wears glasses. Of course, we have many girls who wear contacts, but it is still very easy to find girls wearing glasses here. I used to commute by bus for about an hour every day, and that could be a rather fascinating time for me if there are pretty girls wearing glasses sitting in front of me... well,  I have a quaint preference: I prefer "neat" lenses that are not too blurry or dark for me to observe them. Glasses of high prescription are still enjoyable for me if there are no myodiscs and front view (A real deterrent for me!!!, face back and I would shift my focused eyes away)... Actually I often blushed when such girls suddenly turned their heads back and realised that I am staring at them. I think such fetish is still not quite acceptable by the general public. </p><p> </p><p>If there are not any, I love to see the magnificient scenery of the suburban part of our city. Thus, commute time is usually very pleasant for me.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Serna</b>&nbsp;01 Oct 2007, 03:13</p><p>To Zorab: A very good point--- a low script usually leads on to a higher one and then the glasses become necessities for them rather than accessories.  </p><p> </p><p>In my experience, not all of them do, but most of them do. However, I would not mind that if the girls are wearing them as purely accessories... after all they are destroying their eyes if they do so. ;) As far as I know, wearing as purely accessories often cause much faster prescription growth, about 2-3 times faster I think.  </p><p> </p><p>I am always curious about the fact that many girls with prescriptions between -1 to -4 are neccessary to wear glasses, rather than as pure accessories. Up till now, I consider main the reason for their myopia is mostly because of their long exposure on close works--- and I am curious about this too--- about their general lifestyles, so forth. My pleasure is to observe them...  </p><p> </p><p>I actually dislike too much minification and distortion like that caused by -5 or more minus lenses, combined with thick lenses, which is rather unpleasant for me as I have worn such lenses before and I understand the discomfort caused by such lenses. Thus I dislike seeing girls wearing such "heavy and thick" lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Zorab</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2007, 16:59</p><p>Serna: my ideal gwg has a script of around -4, and if higher than that, has high-index lenses. I love watching the distortion that lenses make, but seeing the thick edge of a powerful lens does nothing for me. </p><p> </p><p>Girls with really low scripts hold a special fascination... in some cases, I think they wear their glasses because they like being seen in them, not because their vision really has to be corrected at all costs. However, in my experience, a low script usually leads on to a higher one... and then the glasses become a necessity rather than an accessory.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Zorab</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2007, 09:58</p><p>Frames are an important part of the appeal of glasses, but for me it is really the lenses which fascinate me most. It follows that I have a preference for frames which allow the lenses to be seen: rimless is best or thin metal ones. The current vogue for thick plastic may be very striking on certain faces, but they also seem to be designed to frustrate lens watchers like me. I hate these extra wide temples, not only because they are ugly but because they prevent any chance of getting a glimpse from the wearer's rear-side, to gauge the script. The front view is not so much better as the heavy shadow cast by thick plastic rims make it really difficult to see what is going on around the edge and often completely conceal the edge thickness of the lens. Does anyone agree? Bring back rimless!</p><p></p><hr>

I just love to sit on a buses behind one of those and look at their glasses--- preferably of light rim or rimless such that I could see the reflection of the lenses... as well as the sharp image from the lenses.

<p><b>Newbe</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2006, 13:48</p><p>I am not new to wearing glasses. I started wearing them when I was in first grade at 6 years old. I have a minus prescription and prefer prism in my lenses to help me read. What I am new to is this website and finding out that there are men out there that prefer gwg. My boyfriend showed me the site after dating a couple of weeks. At first I didn't really understand because I fell for the old 4 eyes cliche' that tends to make a girl feel unattractive in her glasses. Now, my man makes me feel so sexy in my glasses and it is a real turn on for me when he plays with the earpiece and gentle rubs on it behind my ear. This has turned into one of the ways that if we are in a public place, he lets me know that he is thinking that I am sexy without everyone knowing that we can't wait to be alone and intimate. That is another advantage that I didn't even realize before was that while making love I wasn't really able to see my lover's face clearly. Now I can see his handsome face and the intensity of his passion. I want to thank him for loving me and thank you for helping me to understand. </p><p></p><hr>

I've had glasses since I was 18, and when I was 28 I was bullied into full time wear by an eye doctor who was obsessive...they were prescribed for distance and I should be wearing them &amp;c.; But I never had any problem about full time wear.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2006, 18:48</p><p>yes - that was finger trouble. I have no add on my computer glasses.

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2006, 07:33</p><p>R +1.50,-0.50x90 add +1.50 ; L +1.25,-0.50x90 add +1.50 and for computer work (actually I wear these always indoors since I can focus quite sharptly to about 10ft, sometimes more and reading is easier for me than with the progressives): R +2.25,-0.50x90; L +2.00, -0.50 x90 add +1.50 </p><p> </p><p>So nothing earth shattering. I could do without them for distance, but then the fine details are missing, i get a headache and anything close is really blurry, so i just wear them.

<p><b>Larika</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2006, 01:34</p><p>Actually why most people who don't like wearing glasses would eventually wear them when their eyes are about -2 or -2.5? That's about 20/100. (20 % of normal distance eyesight)... I think when they were 20/40 or so they would only squint rarely, but when they are 20/100 they probably wear their glasses full-time. So how blur is that actually? We have not many  pics showing how blurry is the sight of those who suffered from mild nearsightedness. It seems glasses of about -1.5 does help their sight, but they are usually very thin and they wouldn't seems diminish the image a lot. (Only noticeable when they took off their glasses and looking at their glasses to see if there are dirts on their lenses, again we don't have much pics like that) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2006, 16:44</p><p>Seeker - Removing contacts really isn't a tricky procedure for a myope.  For a high myope, it's a good idea to have the glasses and contacts case ready (or at least know where they are) before you start.  The glasses would go on *after* the contacts are out, normally; it can be hard to handle glasses while also holding a contact lens, and while there's no serious risk of not finding the contact lens case on the countertop in front of you, there is a very real risk of not finding a dropped contact lens.  None of this is particularly difficult for a myope, regardless of how strong the myopia, as long as the glasses and lens case are located beforehand.  Being myopic, things come into focus once you get close enough.  The same is not true for someone who's very farsighted; I could imagine a high-hyperope wanting to put their glasses on to be sure the contact lens went into its case...otherwise he would have to do it by feel.</p><p></p><hr>

But when they were too strong, it made me so dizzy because I would have to concentrate so hard to keep focused. </p><p> </p><p>But like the earlier person who posted here, it wasn't the best solution because my summers were always blurry.  By the time I graduated, I could barely recognize people until they were a few feet away and it became more embarassing for me to admit just how bad my eyes were.  Between going to high school and college, I gave in and got my own first pair of glasses and have worn them mostly ever since.  I say mostly because there was a few months that I could not see well because I lost my glasses and could not find them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2006, 20:08</p><p>Dawnie, I liked your story..I was the same way in high school..Right after high school graduation I went and got glasses for the first time that were -2.00 or so, after being nearsighted in high school, borrowing friends glasses and struggling to see the board.. Nine years later, I'm 27 years old now, my prescription is -4.50 and -4.00 in each eye.. How old are you?  What is your prescription now? How long did it take for your friend Jenny to finally go and get glasses??  Do you still keep in touch with Jenny and Sarah and if so do both still wear glasses and what are there prescriptions??  I enjoyed your story, I think its funny how all of us espeically in our high school years are so self-conscious of things like glasses.. Thanks again for sharing your story.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dawnie</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2006, 16:41</p><p>I've been visiting this site for a while, but never posted. But the topic of glasses borrowing among girlfriends reminded me of my own experience.  </p><p>During my senior year of HS my freind Stacey got glasses, and me and our other friend Jenny began borrowing the from her so much that we had to work out a schedule of what period we would need to wear her glasses. I got them for chemestry and english (I sat in the back in those classes). Although there was the time I got them for three days to myself, because both of them were out sick. After graduation, I was glassesless and nearsighted all summer, my first day at college, I went and got my eyes examined and got my own glasses and have worn my own ever since, and as a bonus, I've gotten thicker lenses almost every year since. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2006, 00:36</p><p>Glinthia, I have the same type of vision as you, my left eye is- 7.50 with i.75 astigmatism, my right eye is -2 .25 with 1 .25 astigmatism, normal lenses it did look strange, I converted to high index and its hardly noticeable the difference, I also reduce my frames to medium round and this also stops the difference being noticed, so maybe you could try high index lenses and slightly smaller frames and this may help to compensate for the difference in the lenses. That a lovely unusual name Glenthia. Good luck. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glinthia</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2005, 20:49</p><p>I love watching people who borrow other's glasses. I remember when I was in university, my prescription was weird: -1.25 in left eye while -6.5 in right eye. </p><p>A friend who was about -1 (both eyes) borrowed my glasses and she rejected my glasses immediately after wearing it. Of course she can't see the screen clearly! My prescription is for sure not suitable for her because she thought I was wearing weak prescription glasses, but she didn't notice my "blind" right eye! Of course she was surprised by then. We work in the same company now and she is wearing a rimless -1. But I think actually she has about -1.5 or -1.75 right now because she wears it full time and she told me her eyesight is terrible without her glasses. I think her glasses looks really good with her, it is very light as I know. Of course I can't see clearly with her glasses (But I can cover my right eye and have the same sight as her, and she tried my glasses by covering her righe eye and she told me everything's so crisp that surprised her). I'm now -1.75 left eye and -9.5 right eye. It's comfortable to wear them but I look really strange. I also have a  +1, -7.75 glasses for reading because recently I can't read with my stronger minus glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

I was hoping she was reaching into her bag for a pair of glasses, and low and behold, out came a fantastic pair of silver rimmed large round glasses that covered a lot of the top 1/2 of her face. We had several conversations and she would look straight into my eyes when I was talking, and to my delight, she wore them all throughout the meal. </p><p> </p><p>It was a fantastic sighting that still tops my list now as she was extremely hot, I unfortunately haven't seen her since then.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lazysiow</b>&nbsp;17 Dec 2005, 06:34</p><p>Well sadly no borrowing glasses in my story, but a few weeks ago an attractive girl at my work (brunette, long hair, kind of youngish but with a shy smile) showed up with extremely thick cross between harry potter and oliver people's style -8's. She got a lot of questions about them, pity I was working on some machines behind a cubicle wall :( Another girl who was a full timer started up a conversation with her and they were comparing prescriptions, when she said she was -8, the full time girl said oh my god. You must be blind, I'm only -3.5 something like that. Then they tried each other's glasses on. </p><p> </p><p>As soon as I heard -8 I was immediately making up excuses to pop out behind the wall and pretend like I was looking for someone else. Both of them were holding out each other's glasses and looking at the rings and the -8 girl tried on the -3.5's and said, its a bit better but I still can't see a thing. She was then talking about how normally she wears contacts but every now and then she just likes her eyes to breathe.  </p><p> </p><p>Now I'm sure she's noticed that I've been checking her out a lot lately lol</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Slit</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2005, 20:09</p><p>Adelle, </p><p> </p><p>Go ahead, post more of the incidents you remember, real world stories are very interesting to read.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2005, 19:02</p><p>I've encountered the same situation many times. Especially back in school years there were many students, mostly girls, that borrowed glasses to see the blackboard. I remember a close female friend of mine, who denied to buy glasses for a couple of years, although she badly needed them. She would always rip her friend's -2.5 glasses off her face during class in order to see the board. Finally, during the last year at school, she showed up with a wonderful pair of plastic rimmed -3 glasses! </p><p> </p><p>One day, about a year ago, I was playing bowling with some friends and the sister of another female friend of mine had troubles with her contact lenses. She was wearing them all day and finally her eyes had given up. So she took them off, but with a prescription of -5.5 she wasn't able to bowl bare-eyed. Fortunately for her, her sister was wearing her -4.5 glasses that night. For the rest of the game they were sharing the glasses, even though the girl still complained that she couldn't see well. Nevertheless it was fun to watch all that taking-off putting-on all night. </p><p> </p><p>Also, a few weeks ago, at the cinema, a friend's girlfriend forgot her glasses and, as my friend has a lower prescription, he gave his glasses to her to watch the movie. If I remember well my friend had a very low prescription, about -1 while her girlfriend had -2 or -1.5. </p><p> </p><p>Finally, the most exciting incident of all, happened some years back. I was dating a girl that had the exact same prescription with her older sister (about -3). She would wear only glasses, while her sister wore mainly contacts. I had seen only once her sister wear her glasses and I was really thrilled by them. They were the most amazingly huge round frames and they would cover large part of her face. They were not stylish at all, but I was very excited about them. I dreamed for a lot of time that my girlfriend would wear them just for once. And my dream came true. One night that we were to go out, she showed up wearing her sister's glasses. In her hastiness to be ready on time she sat on her glasses and totally broke them. So her sister gave her her own glasses. For three days I was totally turned on. Whenever we met, she wore her sister's glasses, even during sex! I went to the shops with her, made her try several pairs of glasses and helped her pick up new frames. Sadly, after those three days I never saw again her sister's glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I remember many more incidents, but since there is the limit of 600 words, I will stop here.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2005, 02:26</p><p>Hi, </p><p>I love to watch girls or women who wear glasses borough from a friend. Ten years ago a secretary in the office I worked come to work one morning with glasses. I told her that she looks very nice with her specs ans ask if they are new ones. She told me that it were the spare glasses of her sister. She said that she could see not very well in distance but quite good while working and she wanted to try them for the day. </p><p>Is there anyone who can tell stories like that?

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2005, 14:08</p><p>Had a hard time classifying this post. </p><p> </p><p>After the turkey, we all gathered at my brother-in-laws house. He has a six month old "main coon cat."  (very fluffy thing.) Anyhow, we were all sitting around and a certain female that was along took off her glasses and slipped them into her purse. I noticed how this got the cat's attention. Sure enough, a few minutes later, the cat had worked her way over to the purse and was digging out the glasses.  My brother-in-law yelled at the cat, which ran away, and then apologized, stating that the cat had a bit of a glasses fetish! Of course this became the topic of conversation. His wife, who also wears glasses, indicated the cat would go so far as to climb to the top of the couch and come over to her and try to get the glasses off of her face!  Meanwhile, kitty had worked her way back and was once again foraging for the glasses in the purse, forcing her to put them on for safe keeping!  </p><p> </p><p>I could not help thinking to myself what a unique cat this would be to have if I were dating! What wonderful conversations it would prompt! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Not only was she wearing her hair back, so her BTE hearing aids (normally quite well hidden under her longish blonde hair) were plain for all to see. She was also wearing glasses, the first time I have seen her in glasses. Rectangular gold-framed, a bit larger than is fashionable now but with quite a significant prescription, -4 or -5 I guess. The only downside was that she has wonderful green centres to her eyes and they were not so visible behind the glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>My friend is in her late 20s. I find disability in eyesight and hearing, when it contrasts with otherwise perfect health in someone so young, quite a turn on. Am I the only person on this forum who finds the combination of hearing aids and glasses attractive? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>T2</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2005, 18:36</p><p>Tim - that boy you described, could be me!  I was the most reluctant spex wearer and absolutely refused to give in.  Of course, I wandered about blind as a bat at school and it was always a rush to sit in the front row where at least I could screw up my eyes and try to peer at the board or look at the work of the boy next to me.  As for recognising people, I just pretended to be in a "dream" and just stare into space until whoever it was came near enough for me to recognise.  But it was awkward when waiting for a bus and being asked by some old lady "What's the number of this bus coming along?"  I hated it being obvious to even strangers that I was so shortsighted and used to walk away - of course missing the bus myself!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;16 Jul 2005, 13:48</p><p>Great stuff, Willy. Do you happen to remember any more details about the girl in the chemistry class? There's something very enchanting about people who refuse to wear glasses... I have never seen girls do that 'Chinese' squint myself, but I have known a boy who did it for quite a while. About five years. He was that determined not to get glasses (though his nearsight was glaringly obvious to everybody). It was just when he simply couldn't see the board in school anymore that he started pulling the lid of either eye. That way he seemed to cope very well. But he had to do it a lot, he even got some kind of squinting wrinkles. Kinda creepy ;) But overall, he was quite lost with his poor sight, having to read everything so close and you can't really use that Chinese squint to recognize people...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Willy</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2005, 11:39</p><p>I find it difficult nowadays to find "age-appropriate" inspirations like the ones from my youth I've recently recounted.  Very few late-30s to mid-40s myopes going around squinting and uncorrected.  Presbyopia is more of an issue, but I wouldn't think women (or men for that matter) would let it go uncorrected for too long, at least once it gets to the point where she has to hold a paper at arms length and squint.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Willy</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2005, 10:14</p><p>Another fond memory: </p><p> </p><p>In junior high one time at McDonald's with two female classmates, one a full-time wearer, the other myopic but without glasses yet.  The non-wearer commented on needing glasses and having to squint to see the menu and was reassured by the full-time wearer that her eyes couldn't be that bad yet, since without her glasses she could not read the menu even squinting.  Their conversation then turned to a third girl not present, who had glasses but did not wear them often, and how both the other girls noticed how often and in what circumstances she squinted.  Their tone was one of respect, along the lines of "boy, her eyes are bad, but you've got to admire how she avoids wearing her glasses."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daffy</b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2005, 23:39</p><p>Back in the days of my schooling, i remember doing the squint and pulling the eye area to see the board. I must have looked rediculous. Funny thing though, i never knew i needed glasses. I don't know what i thought, i think i was oblivious. I tried a friends pair but only saw worse (now i know that they were plus glasses), so i concluded that i don't need glasses or they don't help me - I didn't understand optics back then (I was only like 11-12 years old). It was later in high school that i seemed to struggle more. </p><p> </p><p>One day, i had to take a friends school bag home with me because he wanted to go out after school. Half way home, a thought suddenly hit me...he wears glasses...and they are probably in his bag. I looked inside and sure enough - there they were. I looked at them intently before putting them on. I noticed that everything through the lenses was clear, but small. This made me wonder. As i started to slip them on, a sudden rush came over me (like when getting caught speeding by the police is how i can describe it the best). Everything was crisp and clear - it was unbelievable. I took them off quickly because i didn't want anyone to see me. Then i though it was silly-everyone wears glasses-and noone cares. I think i put them on and realised that i could read road signs and house numbers. It was then that i realised i needed glasses. But, it took me another 4 years to work up the courage to tell my parents. It was only when i went to college that i realised i was being silly. I went and got my own pair. </p><p> </p><p>I think that was my turning point in desiring glasses and my facsination with them. </p><p> </p><p>In a way, i wish that i was discovered earlier and wore glasses since grade 4 when i think i started to notice. Oh well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hansel</b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2005, 14:36</p><p>Thanks Willy for bringing back a memory. Similarly, girl at college in Manchester in the 70s, pulling back ide of her eye to "improve" her view of the board. </p><p>Always a shy one, keen to ask her out, but never plucked up courage.  </p><p>Our lectures didn't tally so much as time wore on but probably 18 months later spotted her, having finally given up the unequal struggle, wearing full time.

<p><b>Willy</b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2005, 14:09</p><p>Just wanted to maybe bring this thread around to the named topic by harkening back to the greatest squint of my youth.  It was a girl in a college chemistry class who sat in the front row, no more than 10 feet from the board.  To read the board she had to both squint and use both hands to pull back on her temples, resting her elbows on the desk.  So when there was note-taking to be done, it was squint and pull, then pick up pencil to write, squint and pull, etc.  I sat a couple of rows behind her and to the side and was mesmerized every class. </p><p> </p><p>When she finally got glasses, she did not go full-time at first, but did after a couple of months and then went to contacts. </p><p> </p><p>Anyone else care to reminisce or report? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Matthew</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2005, 06:13</p><p>Thomas - There are new contact lenses now, like Focus Night and Day, that are a lot better for dry eyes.   I don't think that particular lens goes up to your prescription normally though.  You might ask your doctor whether something like that is available up to your full prescription. </p><p> </p><p>The idea of GoC might be worth considering, but I think wearing contacts at your full prescription would be much much better.  Plus, when I've done GoC, I find that the glasses seem to encourage my eyes to dry out a little more (can't explain why).  So I think the only reason you'd want to do GoC is if there is a lens available that you find more comfortable than others but you can't get it in your full prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;09 Jul 2005, 03:31</p><p>Thanks JD - Yes I too had a lot of trouble with dry eyes causing my lenses to drop out unpredictably.  I gave up (3 yrs ago) buy my RX has got worse now -18.50 and have thought about GOC to try to have thinner lenses and make up the rest with contacts, but am very undecided now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JD</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2005, 12:11</p><p>Thomas - I use eyedrops throughout the day, but when I get home I remove the contacts.  Air conditioning and ceiling fans seem to make my eyes dry out faster. It's a pain but I manage.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2005, 15:59</p><p>JD (Jun 27) Can you tell me how exactly you deal with dry eyes please?  Is it just by using eyedrops or anything else? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2005, 07:47</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>HMG, </p><p> </p><p>Good question.  Both the front and the back are concave -- hence biconcave.  The myodisc is then ground into the back so there are two concave surfaces on the back of the lens.  Yes, my lenses are thicker to accomodate these three concave surfaces.  The edges are about 6 mm thick.  I would rather have the negative lenses and have edge thickness than deal with the plus (convex) lenses which are used to correct farsightedness but are also for the correction of high myopia. In these cases the plus lens is reversed for the high myope so that the back of the lens for the high hyperope becomes the front for the high myope.  What had been the front of the lens for the high hyperope is now the back for the high myope.  This center portion of the lens is the thick part of the lens into which the myodisc is then ground.  In some cases of extremely high myopia, a second myodisc can be ground into the front of the plano surface creating a "double myodisc".  The advantage of plus lenses is that they are thin at the edges (since the thickness is in the center) and thus the wearer can use a wider frame and have a larger bowl through which to see.  What I don't like about them is the magnification that the plus carrier produces juxtaposed against the minification that the myodisc produces.  Therefore, from head on you will have the typical myopic small eyes surrounded by magnification of that part of one's face that falls within the carrier portion of the lens.  So the observer will see that portion of your face in three sizes: tiny, magnified and then normal.  Too, when my eyes stray out of the myodisc, I'm still looking through a negative lens and have some limited vision.  With the plus carrier I have none. My prescription has increased slightly over three years and has gone from OS-25 to -26 and OD -23 to -23.75.  I've ordered new lenses which I know will be a bit thicker than current ones.  Hope this helps and doesn't confuse.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>HMG</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2005, 21:55</p><p>Patrick B, I'm having a little trouble visualizing your biconcave myos.  I understand that the front of your lenses are concave and that you have a 20 mm blended myodiscs on the back of the lenses, but is the back carrier portion plano or biconcave, or do you consider the concave front and the myodisc on the back to contitute a biconcave lens? It seems to me that if both sides of the lenses were biconcave and the myodiscs were ground into a back concave side you would need thicker lenses to achive this.  I hope you understand my question, thanks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoffrey</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2005, 12:23</p><p>Hi Ree, thanks for your concern. </p><p>I am almost 23 (next month).  I have been evaluated on several occasions for IOLs, with the same result, no way.  So I live with the glasses and poor vision.  One doctor at Mass Eye and Ear said the IOLs would not improve my vision much anyway because my retinas are in such poor condition.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JD</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2005, 10:41</p><p>Thomas I wear contacts and deal with the dry eyes thing.  By the end of the day my eyes are uncomfortable and then it's glasses for me.  For reading when the contacts are in I have readers which helps out.  Somehow having to put on reading glasses doesn't seem so tramatic as having to wear -14 glasses all the time.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2005, 10:36</p><p>Sorry, the contacts!  Well, my brother and i did try them a while ago.  it was a nightmare.  they were uncomfortable, moved about it my eye and one of Tim's got behind his eye and he rushed round to the doctor in a panic.  they got it out of course but it gave him a fright.  We both have kind of 'dry eyes' too (is there a technical word for that do you think?)and that meant putting in drops all the time.  People thought we were weeping all the time.  It was enough to put me right off. </p><p>Thomas.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2005, 10:29</p><p>Thanks juilan.  I went on anothe rthread and replied to a rude message from some weirdo - glad to find sanity here again! </p><p>I do understand all you say - and it helps quite a bit so i'm going to see someone soon.  I've discovered oakley glasses - they are cool too!  i'm going to ask if my Rx will go in them - a mate of mine has just got some and man, they are really hot!  So maybe your second point is right on!  I laughed at your 4 remark (of 3).  But I can'tjust push them down - i have to take them off to see close up - but only when i'm by myself.(Cringe again). </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2005, 10:10</p><p>Thomas: Three things. 1. The most important thing not how your glasses look to other people but how they look to you - when you look through them I mean. Bifocals, myodisks...if they improve your vision that's the main thing. </p><p>2. On the other hand, whatever they are like there are people (of both sexes) who will think you look hot in them. </p><p>3. Someone asked if you've tried contacts - you haven't answered that one. If you CAN wear contacts you'll have better distant vision, and all you'll need for near work is a simple pair of reading glasses. </p><p>4. The fourth of my three things [::)] is that pushing your specs down your nose may make reading easier - and it's certainly cheaper than the other options!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2005, 10:05</p><p>Brian-16.  Yes, either bifocals or I could have progressive lenses I suppose or would that not be possible with my high rx?   </p><p>I'm seriously considering not going to university now, mainly because of the reading probs.  You be careful mate - your eyes will end up like mine if you do 4 yrs study!!!  Possibly I'll go and visit friends in Australia or New Zealand and maybe get some work experience on their farms.  I might also do some visiting of my father's friends in Hong Kong before coming home to do ....? </p><p>Anyhow, all the best and thanks for your help. </p><p>Thomas</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2005, 04:32</p><p>Thomas-I think bi-focals are the way to go for you.I also have the worst vision in my extended family,both un-corrected and corrected.Probably be even worse after 4 years of college studying.Go for the bi-focals!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thomas</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2005, 17:30</p><p>Patrick B &amp; Mattp - I really want to say thanks for what you both wrote.  I do realise that even with my poor eyesight and thick specs at least I can still see things, and I'm going to get some advice from the optician about bifocals - it looks as if that's my best hope now.  btw, yes you are both around my father's age and he too is shortighted, as are my brother, mother, grandfather and uncles and cousins!  It's really frightening to think of it but I'm the one who has the worst eyes of the whole family and I know my cousins look in horror at what might happen to them.  BUT I'm learning to love my new rimless spex too, so it's not all gloom.  Thanks a bunch for helping. </p><p>Thomas</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mattp</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2005, 11:38</p><p>Thomas-- </p><p> </p><p>I'm a lot older than you (50) and my RX is quite dissimilar to yours (in the -4.75 range), but I have shared some of your embarrassment and self-consciousness about wearing glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>I first got glasses in 5th grade and hated them--refused to wear them.  I was always afraid kids would laugh or call me 4-eyes, and they did when i would wear them.  I remember one incident at summer camp when I would not wear them on the rifle range and couldn't see my target.  When the instrctor looked at my target, he saw no bulltet holes while others' targets all had these mysterious extra holes.  Rather than put on my glasses, i never went to the rifle range again. </p><p> </p><p>By the time I was in college, I had to wear glasses all the time, but still took them off for pictures and such. </p><p> </p><p>In my early thirties I needed reading glasses and refused bifocals (too young), settling instead on two pairs of glasses.  As with wearing glasses all the time, I finally had to admit I needed bifocals (then trifocals).  At that point, I tried progressives but found peripeheral vision too poor to wear them. I finally wore the trifocals willingly, saying they were cool because I was too young to need them so they were a fashion statement. </p><p> </p><p>Now, at 50, I've gone to progressives because I'm afraid the trifocals make me look older than I am.  But i don't see as well. </p><p> </p><p>What I'm saying through all this, is others share your feelings. Of course, no one can do anything about how well you see, but others share the feelings you have.  From my old man perspective, if i were you I'd get a pair of bifocals.  At 17, bifocals aren't going to make you look old, and the reading vision might make your bookistore experiences more comfortable. </p><p> </p><p>Good luck--Matt</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2005, 08:48</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Thomas, </p><p> </p><p>Although I'm old enough to be your father (46) I was 17 once and do remember being embarrassed by having to wear such thick glasses.  And in those days they were really thick!!I None of the high-index materials were around. I was around -15 back then.  By the time you get to college virtually nobody will notice or care.  I'm convinced that most people are hardly aware of lens strength and only focus on the glasses themselves.  Most of what you deal with today is normal teenage angst. </p><p>Like Brian and me, you will probably never have 20/20 with glasses.  Have you tried contacts which Brian can't do because of his prism correction.  </p><p> </p><p>I fought bifocals until I was in college and loved them when I got them.  It was such a pleasure not having to pull my glasses down from my eyes to see up close or put on another and older pair with a weaker prescription.  What a hassle!  Your eyes will probably stabilize when your major growth is over.  My progression started to slow down when I was 18/19 with small increases every so often over the years.  I just had an exam and over three years I had an increase of -1 in the left eye and -.75 in the right.  Enough to warrant getting new lenses.  Hope this helps.  You're not alone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

(sorry for the pun).  i too have to squint a lot or else try to get close to what i'm trying to see.  objects are ok but people don't seem to like it when i attempt to focus on them - at least my friends understand why i do it and they don't really mind.  i've two real friends only i don't see them much in the summer because they go abroad to their villa in Italy.  We have a boat in the east coast and do a lot of sailing which i like.  they never ask me to be the 'lookout' though Iwonder why?

My new specs are ok for distance (well, up to a point) but don't seem to help me to see to read.  I've been trying to manage without glasses but using a magnifier but only when I'm alone - it's embarassing to me.  In shops and especially bookstores I'm always having to get help to see where the stuff i want is and I guess the staff know me now, but i think they laugh at me because of my poor sight.  It's the constant knowing that you are the object of people's shock, horror and even pity that really gets to me sometimes - I just hate being thought of as the "poor boy in the coke bottles".  My brother is asking me to try myodiscs which someone he knows has or get a new prescription with a reading bit at the bottom.  I've just got a new pair and find them light and confortable to wear so i'm not going to change them quickly.  I guess that a lot of my probs are caused by my own feelings in a way.  As people my age, have you found the same or have you somehow escaped all that or if not, how do you cope?

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2005, 13:51</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Geoffrey, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for the information. I'm supposed to have an exam tomorrow and will once again ask my doctor about bifocals.  The problem with a larger bowl is that I would need a larger diameter carrier lens which would be considerably thicker if I continued to use a negative carrier.  With a plus carrier it would probably be OK but I don't like the plus carriers not only because of the contrast between the negative bowl and the positive carrier itself but because of the somewhat jarring lack of vision if my eyes stray outside of the bowl into the carrier part itself.  At least when I look through the negative carriers I do have some limited vision (blurry but a bit better than without glasses) so the contrast isn't so unsettling. </p><p> </p><p>I think I am going to have a slight increase in my prescription since I have recently been finding myself pushing my glasses up against my eyes more frequently to see properly, especially at dusk or inside. Even after a lens update I still do this, but not as often. Someone I know caught me doing this a couple of weeks ago as I was trying to spot somebody across a hotel lobby.  He asked if he could help which is always a bit embarrassing.  </p><p></p><hr>

So i guess you are an adult now, and if your posterior capsule has been left behind during your lensectomy,, then even now yopu can be fitted with intraocular lenses,, which should give you far superior vision, thus requiring glasses only for intermediate and close work.  Did you get a medical opinion for this?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Geoffrey</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2005, 10:09</p><p>Patrick B: </p><p>I have worn the bifocal lenticulars since a lensectomy about 12 years ago.  My first ones had fairly large frames and 40mm bowls, later 35mm bowls and now around 32mm.  My prescription has not changed much except the add is stronger than originally.   </p><p>When I had the lensectomy they would not implant IOLs on someone my age.  Have tried aphakic contacts but my eyes are too dry, so glasses.  I also have separate glasses for intermediate distances, also with bifocals, and some just for reading.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>stingray</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2005, 19:36</p><p>Its interesting about what we think of our eyes.  When we go to the dentist, we do not want him to find cavities.  When we go to the doctor we hope he doesnt find anything wrong with us.  Yet, when we go to the eye doctor, we hope he finds our vision has deteriorated and more correction is desired.

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2005, 18:12</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Geoffrey, </p><p> </p><p>That's quite interesting.  I just don't think that it's doable with a 20mm bowl.  I could have a larger bowl, I suppose, but I haven't come across any optical dispensers who have access to bifocal myodiscs. That outfit in Hong Kong doesn't do them either and  my doctor simply says for me to use a weaker pair of glasses for reading and one pair that I have are about 3 diopters less than my current myodiscs.  They're conventional biconcave 1.67 lenses from Lenscrafters and are very thick with heavily rolled edges.  They really distort my face, and I so much prefer the myodiscs in the 1.8 high index.  I recently ran into a highly myopic friend of mine the other night (he's around -12) and he commented at how much more attractive my lenses were.  It took him a bit to realize that they were myodiscs because they don't really aren't that noticeable.</p><p></p><hr>

Here in Brasil I can not find "lenticular" or they are way too expensive, and I never been able to use contact lenses so my actual glasses are real thick and I look "highly unusual", as somebody pointed out. I have +25,50 and +25,75 top and 15 prism base out.

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2005, 09:25</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Deidre, </p><p> </p><p>The term "lenticular" is the technical term used to describe what are more commonly known as myodiscs.  It also is the term applied to high-power plus glasses which were -- as you note --  used primarily by post-cataract surgery patients before the widespread use of implantable lenses.  However, the concept is the same in both cases:  a high-power inner lens (whether for plus or minus correction) in a carrier lens.  I saw a handsome twenty-something man last year who was wearing plus lenticulars which, in my opinion, made him highly unusual.  Perhaps he was naturally super farsighted or perhaps he had had cataract surgery (rare in someone so young) but couldn't have the implantable lenses for whatever reason.  I'm not, incidentally, an opthamologist.  In any event, he moved down a staircase with great care:  he held onto the rail and bent his head over so that he could look straight down at the stairs.  I find I do that somewhat since I cannot see where to step if I don't look directly down  at the stair.  Oftentimes I will let someone else go first so I can take that extra bit of time to look deliberately down through my glasses to see where to take my first step. Similar problem with escalators.  Going up is less of an issue. </p><p> </p><p>Brian, </p><p> </p><p>Glad my information was of some use.  I'll be curious to see how much my eyes have changed next week.  I think my increase will be around -.75.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2005, 08:49</p><p>-14, </p><p>Where did you get your plano carrier myodiscs? Mine are plus carrier. The good part is that they ae very thin at the edges but the bad part is that the plus carrier is more evident than the plano version. I have not had any luck finding the plano version.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DEIDRE</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2005, 18:40</p><p>Patrick B </p><p>MYODISCS are for heavy minus corrections. LENTICULAR lenses are for plus corrections like the ancient heavy plus corrections for post-cataract patients, now practically non-existent </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2005, 18:28</p><p>Patrick B-Thanks for the update and info on your rx and v.a.Before I head for college in late August I have to another exam.Now my rx only allows 20/25 in my right eye and about 20/20 I guess in my left eye.Unlike my brother I do not see as well as he does with his specs.And I am also aware of the minification with higher rx lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2005, 16:42</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Brian and -14, </p><p> </p><p>I was so busy describing myodiscs to T2 that I left out my own prescription which is OS-25 and OD -23.  I'm in my mid-forties and the big changes were over by my mid-twenties.  Still ... last year I had a small -.25/-.50 increase which I did nothing about.  I think I have had another small increase and will find out for certain next week at my exam.  I'm pushing my glasses up against my face a bit more than usual so I'm probably due for a lens change. </p><p> </p><p>Re my visual acuity (after a lens update) I probably see about 20/30 or 20/40 depending upon the lighting.  With bright sunshine or bright interior lighting I see pretty well, even with  minimization which prevents full 20/20.  If the day is dark or I'm in a darkish interior I would say my visual acuity declines to 20/50 or 20/70.  Much depends on keeping my glasses close to my eyes.  Therefore, I sometimes wear a headstrap to keep them tightly in place for optimal vision.  Usually I do this when I'm driving as I think it looks pretty bad otherwise.  I rarely drive at night with glasses.  I suspect, Brian, that unlike your brother you will never quite achieve 20/20 either.  Some people have amazing acuity with very high prescriptions and others of us sort of limp along.  After all of these years it really doesn't bother me. I can pretty much get 20/20 with my RGP CLs. More important is maintenance of general eye health which can be so problematic in a high myope.  So a bit of blur with glasses is the least of my worries. </p><p> </p><p>I kind of doubt that story about trifocal myodiscs, and I have never found anyone who said that it was possible to do bifocals with a 20mm bowl.  I think it would drive someone crazy!  You're lucky, -14, to have the options you do.  I don't with my prescription. </p><p> </p><p>Keep well, and have a great weekend. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2005, 13:54</p><p>Patrick B </p><p> </p><p>like RL i'm only -14 but i too have myodiscs. mine are regular, not blended, and have a plano carrier. they are only 3mm thick and the bowls are 25mm. the fronts are plano but with the AR, reflections are minimal. the entire bowl is useable so the viewing area is much like the "sweet spot" of my regular lenses. </p><p>althought i have never seen them, i have chatted with people on ES who claim they have bifocal lenticulars. in fact one young man from the state of rhode island in the US said he had trifocals. when i asked the size of the segments he was rather vague. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2005, 11:01</p><p>Patrick B- </p><p>I am intriqued by myo-discs.I am not there,yet.Was curious about your rx and do see you 20/20 and do things look smaller?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2005, 09:28</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hi T2 </p><p> </p><p>I'm surprised that your brother hasn't been told about myodisc lenses. At -16.5 and -18 he could be wearing them now like RL who is "only" a -14. </p><p> </p><p>Myodisc lenses (technically called lenticular lenses) are designed for highly myopic people where the lens thickness of a conventional lens would simply be too thick to be worn practically.  Usually they become an option for anything over -15 but generally become mandatory for anything over -20. This was especialy true before the introduction of high-index lens materials.  Not too many people have them but what you have is a sort of lens within a lens which looks like a circle within the outer (or carrier) lens.  That is where the extra power is located and you only see through that part of the lens.  The carrier lens can be either a plus or a minus lens. </p><p> </p><p>In my case I have chosen a 1.8 high-index negative carrier with biconcave fronts. (Are your brother's lenses biconcave?  I would think that they would be.)  The myodisc lens is only 20mm across in a frame which is 46 mm wide by 26 mm.  The myodisc has been blended into the carrier so that it isn't as readily noticeable.  The edge thickness is a bit over 5 mm.  I like the negative carriers rather than the plus ones since the area around the mydodisc in a plus carrier magnifies that portion of the face while ones eyes behind the myodiscs (already small in appearance) seem even more so in contrast.  The good deal about the plus carriers is that there is almost no edge thickness.  If you look at me head on you will notice a substantial cut-in from the neegative carrier which would be even greater if it weren't for the blended myodisc.  The viewing area really isn't that much different from what you and your brother have right now since you look primarily through the center of your lenses for the sharpest and least distortion-filled view.  You can always spot the high myope because we always have to turn our heads more if we want to see something off to the side since we haven't any peripheral vision and the distortion outside of the center portion of the lens is troublesome. I also like the biconcave fronts (as opposed to plano fronts) where some of the power is located because  light doesn't flash so readily off of the front immediately giving you away (even at a distance) as a high myope.  Not that I'm fooling anyone who has any knowledge of high myopia. </p><p> </p><p>Hope this helps and doesn't confuse.  There is a picture of myodisc glasses at a Hong Kong optical website called Optical4Less.  These people specialize in high prescriptions of all sorts. </p><p> </p><p>Re your brother's reading problem myodisc lenses won't help him on that front because they're only a different type of a single vision lens. He's going to have to have bifocal lenses if he wants to see up close. Too, myodiscs can't be made as a bifocal because of the small area involved so they won't help your brother with his reading problem.  With his progression (I was somewhere around -18 at 20) he'll probabaly have no choice in a few years but to go with myodisc lenses.  I have several older and weaker pairs that I use for reading and simply switch back and forth.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Would they help someone like Tom with his high RX to both see in the distance and read a  book up close?  you see, that's what seems to be the difficulty now - he can't focus on small print with his glasses on and so has taken not to wearing them.  Someone else has suggested bifocals but Tom's reluctant because as a 17 year old he thinks those are for 'old people'.  If he's still holding out, maybe the next time we have a change I'll have them and see if that helps me to read better.  I must admit, I sometimes go "bareyed" last thing at night when reading in bed.  I usually polish my specs and pop them away before reading myself to sleep - only to waken up because the light is on and have to fumble for the switch!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>T2</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2005, 11:01</p><p>Hi, Mattp.  I've been talking to you on another thread!  Actually, we are far from being reluctant and shy specs wearers - with our RX we have really no option!  If you've lived in a place or gone to school where glasses are unusual or considered "weak" then wearing thick bottle-bottom specs soon marks you out and the names begin to fly thick and fast.  We've had more than enough of that and so sites like these are a way for us to get our own back.  Does that make sense?  Until finding eyescene I'd no idea of the sheer breadth and depth of interest in this subject - and just how much onecan learn.  Tom's going to have to go some to catch up!</p><p></p><hr>

Yes, I imagine Tom first tried the guysglasses site and was refused because of age - although he's now nearing 18!  Anyhow, when he returns (Sunday night I think) I'll give him an intro to it all and let him do what he wants.  He doesn't have a computer of his own (he's avoided computers because of having to get quite near the screen and at school was too selfconscious and just opted out!) I know he's now got out of all that and will be fine.

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2005, 17:32</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>T2:  It looks like your brother will soon be wearing myos if his progression doesn't start to slow down.  I began wearing mydodiscs when I was around -16 and started by getting used to them in sunglasses. In those days they were far more noticeable cosmetically since the high-index materials hadn't been developed.  Also, they weren't blended. You could really see the myodisc surrounded by the carrier portion of the lens. Anyway, now when I want to read for any length of time I use one of my older and weaker pairs (as Geoffrey advises) or just pull my glasses down my nose a bit for up close work.  I'm great at threading a needle without glasses!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>T2</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2005, 13:06</p><p>Geoffrey.  </p><p>No, that's the trouble - he came off his bicycle and smashed them up real bad!  I lent him one of my own pairs but we had to go and have a new examination and both opted for rimless.  It took us a good bit of persuasion for the optician to agree to Tom's request but they did it in the end with a very high index lens - he told us the name but I don't remember what.  Very expensive for a teenager but my parents are used to that by now! </p><p>Thanks for taking the trouble, Geoffrey. </p><p>Tim2.</p><p></p><hr>

I qite understand about being turned on by a good looking woman or man but surely whether they wear glasses is not important - but rather the personality of whoever it is.  Although, come to think of it, I suppose people in uniform have a sort of effect on me.  I remember being stopped by a policeman who was about my own age at the time (23) and noticing how smart he looked.  AND he wore glasses too - how interesting to have that memory jogged!

<p><b>T2</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2005, 16:47</p><p>I'm intrigued by what you said about thick specs turning you on.  What is it that attracts you - is it the specs themselves, or the thick lenses, or the wearer?  Having worn thick specs like that for 16 years now they have sort of just become part of me that I take for granted but when I think about it I could never do without.  But I never think of them as kind of desirable so they don't hold any fascination for me.  I used to keep all my old glasses but when we last moved my mother decided to give lots of our old glasses away to the charity that uses them for blind people overseas. when I found out, I was really mad at her  it was as if she'd given away part of me!  But she never discovered those which were my old favourites because I hid them in an old shoebox where she never looked so I still have about 8 pairs which when I look at them, represent almost my half my life.  Unfortunately I don't know what power the lenses are as I never took much notice of my prescription in those days.  </p><p></p><hr>

Can you tell me what "ft" means.  being new to this there's a lot of jargon with terms I don't understand.  I've worn glasses nearly all my life but have never really wondered about how it all works - ignorance I suppose!

How do other high myopes manage theirs?  (I hope I'm not offending anyone by saying I mean real myopes as opposed to those of you who do it for fun). </p><p>T2</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>murky</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2005, 05:17</p><p>My favourite fetish is borrowing someone elses glasses, especially womens, with mild + or -, and wearing them. I once borrowed a girls +1 s, with a gorgeous red frame, and wore them round the office, getting odd looks from colleagues. I now buy womens used glassses in second hand stores,(10 dollars or less) and have outings to the supermarket, looking unconcerned, as if they belong to me , does anyone else enjoy this harmless pursuit?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2005, 18:15</p><p>Hi Tim2. Nice to hear from you, and welcome to the EyeScene community. But where do you and your brother get the idea he's too young to join us? We have a regular contributor of Tom's age who's been with us since he was 16 - and his myopia is about half way between the two of you. Looking forward to hearing more from you. Either or both of you!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim2</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2005, 16:58</p><p>Sorry, that last bit should read - 9.50!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim2</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2005, 16:56</p><p>Hi!  I've just found this site through my younge brother who's really more myopic than me.  He's too oyung yet to jon so I'm his proxy!  We are from a family with very high levels of myopia - grandparents seem to have handed it on to their children and so Tom and I seem always to have had to have thick specs.  I'm 24 and am -8 &amp; -95.0 and Tom who is 6 years younger than me has -14.50 &amp; -13.00.  I often wonder why his degree of shortsight has outstripped mine.  You would think that it would be me who was more given my age and the fact that I've spent nearly all my school and university life huddled up in libraries with my nose in a book.  This is my first posting so I'm not entirely sure that I've got the hang of it yet.  Be good to get some feedback from some of you more experienced ones.  I've got some stories to share - if thiss is the right place. </p><p>Tim2 (just to ensure that the other Tim doesn't think I'm an interloper).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wolf</b>&nbsp;17 May 2005, 08:22</p><p>Hi Tim, it was very interesting to read your posting. At your age I needed glasses with -6. For some time I stayed at this degree of myopia, but instead of stopping at a certain age it increased and suddenly it was a passion for me to wear stronger and stronger glasses. Today I like to show off myself with -12 glasses in the public. Without my glasses I can hardly find them though lying on the shelf near the bed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jane</b>&nbsp;17 May 2005, 05:39</p><p>Tim, you can contact me on minusjane@yahoo.com</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jane</b>&nbsp;17 May 2005, 04:54</p><p>Tim </p><p> </p><p>I love your posts because, like you, I'm myopic (-7) and VERY interested in seeing members of the opposite sex struggling without their glasses. Also, like you, I don't really like taking off my specs in public, though these days I wear contacts. </p><p> </p><p>As a teenager, this only really presented a problem when I went swimming. I felt self-conscious taking my glasses off, putting them in my locker, and then following my blurry friends into the water. They soon discovered that I couldn't recognize them unless they were two feet away from me, and that was really embarrassing when they had to come to find me rather than the other way round. </p><p> </p><p>I'd love to hear more (lots more!) about any times you've had to take your glasses off in front of other people. How do you feel about having to look at things close up if your friends can see you, or feeling for your specs in the morning?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;16 May 2005, 23:46</p><p>Tim, </p><p> </p><p>Some quick maths tell me that a myopic eye with prescription of -5.75 sees clearly to a distance of about 7 inches (17 cm.).  Would you agree with that?  I can't imagine what it would be like to go bare eyed with that Rx.  My son is -3.5, -4.0 and he holds a book quite close to read without his contacts. </p><p> </p><p>I am very attracted to minus women and wish I were mypopic myself.  I've had this fetish for a long time.  I remember being incredibly interested in a girl's glasses from my grade one class.  I was 6 years old.  I always tried to peek through them from behind her and wondered what it was like to need them.   Even then I was careful not to be noticed doing it.  I must have suspected or known this was a little taboo.  It was such a long time ago.  I have no idea what might have "imprinted" this on me at such an early age. </p><p> </p><p>As an adult I am obsessed with just about everything vision related.  It is my biggest pastime and also my biggest source of frustration.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;16 May 2005, 15:23</p><p>Wurm, a good list. There really is no shortage of different things to like about glasses. Now that I think about it, among all kinds of fetishes a glasses fetish can't be that rare. An awfully lot of people need glasses. Add to it the fact that to many having a weakness like needing glasses is a bit awkward, and so you have the grounds for a common fetish. On the other hand, it's weird how nobody talks about it while all kinds of rubber suit thingies get publicity... </p><p> </p><p>Jane, I sort of like being bare-eyed. I do it only when I'm alone, though. Sometimes I go jogging without my -5.75s if the weather's bad and then I get a slightly uncomfortable feeling. It's funny how the world seems to get smaller in the blur, you don't even bother to think that things in the distance exist. But I don't like it when people with moderate myopia say that they are blind without their glasses. It's even offensive. Hazy outlines can make you a little helpless but it's no blindness. </p><p> </p><p>I do avoid taking off my glasses in public because I don't care to draw attention to not being able to see. When alone, I sometimes go bare-eyed for fun. It's interesting to imagine what it would be like to go around like that (especially as I have followed closely two persons who did). -5.75 seems to be a little too much to be able to read comfortably. Squinting then, ahh, that's an exercise that doesn't stop fascinating me! I find I can see the text on the screen from 6 feet away when I stretch the corner of me eye. </p><p> </p><p>Seeker, being totally without glasses and not seeing well is more breath-taking than simply not having up-to-date glasses. Of course, the latter is much more common...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;16 May 2005, 08:50</p><p>I remember a girl at school who for some time - I think 3 or 4 months - got along with inadequate glasses. They were quite weak, not even full time - I remember seeing her put them on and still struggle to see the board. And then there was that day she turned up at school with new glasses, of course, wearing them full time and no more squinting. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Seeker</b>&nbsp;16 May 2005, 01:11</p><p>Jane and Tim </p><p>Is there two steps. The person struggling to get by without glasses and then the person with glasses possibly as an alternate to contacts whose glasses are no longer strong enough and squints through them. I've seen both and must be even more frustrating to have some glasses but still not able to see a sign or in the case I observed read a white board at a training course. At least this person could read my notes and copy from them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jane</b>&nbsp;15 May 2005, 16:07</p><p>Tim - I know exactly how you feel, share your feelings exactly, but I'd like to know more about how YOU cope without your glasses, and whether you feel helpless without them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>--</b>&nbsp;13 May 2005, 06:30</p><p>me too!!!! I especially like guys wearing thin lenses with some noticable astig correction. I like to look at the distortion in the distance (usually there is no distortion to the face, just maybe some cut in or out at the sides) My favorite is when he is sitting on a couch in front of venetian blinds. I also like the way these lenses lend a look of precision to my (hopefully) nerdy companion.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;12 May 2005, 12:17</p><p>My favourites are thin lenses (I know I'll never be like everyone else on this site!) in the -3 to -4 range, thin frames or rimless, often rectangular and never round!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;08 May 2005, 19:28</p><p>Hmm, good question. Here's my attempt at a comprehensive guess, in rough order: </p><p> </p><p>1. Strong Myopia/Thick Lenses </p><p> </p><p>2. Strong Hyperopia/Thick Lenses </p><p> </p><p>3. Needing stronger glasses </p><p> </p><p>4. Wearer losing glasses </p><p> </p><p>5.

Glasses on chains </p><p> </p><p>Also there is various role play involving glasses (secretary, librarian, etc.) to consider.

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;08 May 2005, 16:05</p><p>Hi. I'm a new guy here. I've been going through the Eye Scene archives with enthusiasm. It was very nice to find a community with this special interest. I had already began to think that I was a unique freak of nature but it seems that I'm not a curiosity at all. </p><p> </p><p>I'm 19 years old and -5.75 in both eyes. I go for myopic girls. I'm not interested in glasses per se, they're just an indicator of bad eyesight for me. In other words I'm not aroused by glasses but actually more by the lack of glasses. Squinting and refusing to submit to weak eyesight is the thing for me. I guess I'm in a slight minority here. Or do you have a good overall impression of what are the main "trends" in our fetish and how they are represented? </p><p> </p><p>Myopia is the only eye defect that turns me on, and not even that when it gets to severe numbers (like from -10 on). That's probably because my fetish stems completely from my own experiences. I haven't known people with worse myopia than my own and therefore I can't relate to such a condition. But I went to school with two people whose myopia progressed at the same rate as mine and they were a terrific source of excitement for me all the way from elementary school to high school. I was a boring person myself, starting to wear glasses full-time as soon as I got them (-1.75) and not giving a squint in public ever. But these two schoolmates caused me to acquire a fetish. At least I think so, I'm not a psychologist.  </p><p> </p><p>There was a girl who got strong glasses very early but didn't go fulltime until high school. It was thrilling to see her get by trying to use her glasses (which went up to -6 I guess) as little as possible. Then there was a boy who didn't wear glasses at all until high school although he went up to the -5 territory, too. It's interesting that a boy could have an arousing aspect like this although I'm not gay. It just goes to show that these things are complicated! Anyway, there hasn't been a shortage of squinting people around me. I couldn't help but to start liking them :) </p><p> </p><p>I'd really like to know how common the different types of our fetish are. What do you think? Would it be possible to organize a clear poll?  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

I never saw women (and partially men) dressed in a strange manner. Even if they have normal clothes they look elegant. It's a kind of habit.

Oh.................plastic framed minus lensed glasses covering nearly all a woman's face....................perfection..............glasses these days are just toys by comparison. I think as a woman you should simply by a new pair of glasses which you can use for reading (that is what I did).Then you have the opportunity of sexily swapping the two pairs around,displaying your sexy glasses on the table in a restaurant etc when you use the reading glasses to peruse the menu.Definitely the way forward.And what colour hair do you have? </p><p>Pete XXX</p><p></p><hr>

She's wearing a frame that was very popular back then (translucent (optyl?) plastic with metal temples).  Half the glasses-wearing girls in my grade 12 class wore that style (grad 78).

<p><b>Sandy</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2004, 19:26</p><p>Pete, I am 47 years old.  I grew up in the big frame era also.  My glasses were so big that they covered a large portion of my face back then.  If it comes to the point of bifocals, then I will probably go back towards the larger frames because one of my friends went to bifocals with a smaller frame and she is having serious trouble adjusting to them.  I have tried her glasses on and I can tell that the reading segment should be a lot larger, the smaller frames don't give you that luxury. My eye doctor told me last year that it would be a couple of years.  Lately, I have been having trouble reading the newspaper first thing in the morning.  So I figure that I am about a year away.  I go in for an exam in December, so I'll see then.   Take care.</p><p></p><hr>

Also the hair was pretty big back then.   </p><p> </p><p>Pete, I would love to wear one of my big frames, maybe for Halloween costume.

Which is, of course, followed by the nerdy, geeky, sexy "push up". </p><p> </p><p>Then there's simple, lovely eye magnification: </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v478/jellis/ceccbebf.jpg" target="_blank">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v478/jellis/ceccbebf.jpg</a> </p><p> </p><p>I realize this one is Photoshopped, but there IS such a thing as a woman having her strong plus glasses slide down her nose just enough to "hide" her eyes, which just drives me wild: </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v478/jellis/9417acee.jpg" target="_blank">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v478/jellis/9417acee.jpg</a> </p><p> </p><p>Here are 2 of my all-time favorites from Smudge Report, where their glasses are just WAY too big for their faces: </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v478/jellis/c3eaa894.jpg" target="_blank">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v478/jellis/c3eaa894.jpg</a> </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v478/jellis/0ab80ce5.jpg" target="_blank">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v478/jellis/0ab80ce5.jpg</a> </p><p> </p><p>Big turn-on for me, in that I might see "the big glasses girl" in the store, or in one of my college classes, and she put those glasses on in the morning and looked at herself in the mirror and might have said to herself, "God, I HATE my glasses!  I'm so UGLY!!!"  And maybe overhearing her talk about how blind she is, and that her glasses are "a big pain in the ass".  And, I imagine making sweet love to her, telling her how gorgeous I think she is and how much those huge glasses turn me on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2004, 09:56</p><p>Dear "crazy" can you give some more detail about this? What facts let you to discover this about shiny eyelids?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>You can call me crazy</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2004, 10:16</p><p>Something you might consider is alot of women I have noticed over years of watching tend to have shimmering, shining eyelids when they need glasses.  You can call me crazy, but I have made this connection many times and have been accurate in identifying that the person needs glasses.  Because of the connection, sometimes just seeing the shiny eyelids on a woman can be highly erotic to me.  Has anyone else noticed this ?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Flash</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2004, 19:01</p><p>     A hot day at the festival found me polishing a box I had made of fine cherry with a small rose carved into its lid.  While I was working, a small group of people had gathered to watch handiwork.   </p><p>The sign says you are blind.  Is that true? </p><p>Dont know, says I.  Cant see it. </p><p>This brought a chuckle and helped to release a little tension. </p><p>How are you able to do such fine work if you cant see? </p><p>That my friend, says I, Is the power of love.  If one loves, one can do anything.  When you love, you dont need eyes to see what is before you. </p><p>With this, I gazed blindly in their direction and whispered. </p><p>These boxes are magical.  Wish for anything you truly desire , open the lid, and it will come true. </p><p>A blue blurry figure came closer, selected a box, and paid what I hoped was the appropriate amount of money.  Then she and the rest of the group left. </p><p>It wasnt until a soft voice spoke that I realized someone else was there.  Is it true what you say?  Is the box truly magical?  It was a sweet voice with a hint of shyness </p><p>Yes, says I, it is magical.  It is as magical as the winds that blow through the forest.  I could feel her come closer.  It is as magical as ice-cream on a brownie. My skin tingled as she sat next to me on my work bench.  It is as magical as life. </p><p>I have come to this festival three days in a row to watch you work, says she.  I want to make a wish. </p><p>Then open this box and make your wish?  </p><p>Ignoring the box, she slid close to me and put her hands on my face, her fingers rubbing over my eyes.   </p><p>My wish, she breathed, is for you to love me as much as I love you. </p><p>Then your wish has come true, says I as I leaned forward to share a kiss. </p><p>Kissed delicately, her hands sliding down my face to my shoulders and then to my sides. </p><p>For a moment, I wondered how this woman could love a blind man.  Then sliding my hands down from her slender waist to her hips and then to her thigh, I felt it.  Leather and iron around an unnaturally thin legs.  My heart fluttered. </p><p>Tensing, she said, I have MS.  And then hesitantly, do you still love me? </p><p>Yes, and I always will, says my heart. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>angie</b>&nbsp;22 May 2004, 13:53</p><p>flash: you got it so right when you used the word "intimate."  glasses are a private thing...glasses-wearers all have their own styles of wear, their own rituals for taking care of their glasses, their own habits of taking glasses on and off or playing with them during classes, etc.  and very often, they are not a thing that wearers show the rest of the world...it's always a nice surprise when someone i'm with comes home to take off their contacts and put on glasses, or when they get into bed with a book and slip on a pair of reading glasses.  it's like, "ahh...this is you." </p><p> </p><p>then there's public wear, which says different things to me about men and women.  of course, there are all the typical stereotypes of intelligence and sophistication and maybe a little mystery of "what's underneath that polished demeanor?" which are always turn-ons.  but when i see a woman wearing glasses, i usually think that she's confident, she doesn't feel pressured to conform to what beauty is supposed to be but rather she finds a way to balance trends with her own private style.  when i see a man wearing glasses, i think instead that he's very open, he doesn't have that macho ego thing going on because he's not afraid to let people see that he has a "weakness," and he's someone i could be comfortable around.  and the funny thing is, for me, the sexiest thing about a woman is when she's completely herself, and the sexiest thing about a man is when he's not trying to be macho and impress people...and glasses transmit those traits to me. </p><p> </p><p>of course, electra is right too...aesthetics are certainly a part of it.  nothing like a stylish pair of frames on a cute face.  :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;22 May 2004, 08:38</p><p>I like plus but I prefer the look of minus</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus Crazy</b>&nbsp;22 May 2004, 08:28</p><p>Flash, </p><p>your style of writing is very good &amp; artistic! </p><p> </p><p>Go ahead man write sone GWG stories PLEASE!!! </p><p>Make sure that you write about girls with plus glasses/ reading glasses as well!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Flash</b>&nbsp;21 May 2004, 20:50</p><p>The blury "bedroom eyes" look of a beautiful woman with her glasses off.  The shine of highly polished lenses.  The elegant contour of the frames on a delecate face.  The moment of slipping her glasses off and kissing her delecate lips.  Teasing her into a chase and finally letting her have her glasses back.  Slipping them on her face.--- Glasses are such an intimate part of a woman.  Glasses are like looking through a waterfall into the soul.  I couldn't have one without the other.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;11 May 2004, 09:57</p><p>Tod, it's very hard to put into words isn't it? I've dropped by the chat room a few times lately for stress relief (anyone want to take out a contract on my boss?) and it seems to be a different group of people there to here. Mostly nice people, a couple of jerks, but they're a small percentage compared to most chat rooms. Anyway, soon as they find out I don't wear glasses myself they're curious what's the big deal for me and my MIG fetish. And I can never put in succinctly (hence the website). So, this one guy says "Is it esthetics". So, my answer is yes, because I like the way a guy looks in glasses. So far so good. But then the whole deal about props and planos comes up, and, no that won't cut it folks! So that need thing is there. Why? I have no idea.</p><p></p><hr>

More you will find in Italy or Spain moreover those girls tend to have brown/black let's say dark hair. I prefer dark haired to blonde maybe it's because I'm blonde myself.  </p><p>But I have to say in Germany you can see plus glasses to an age of 14-15 years than the glasses mostly disappear. When they turn to get 30 years they will be often seen in glasses again. </p><p>But as I can see there seems to be trend towards glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2004, 12:39</p><p>Right - I'm going to Germany! Actually - I was booked to go there before reading anything posted below. But it's true that in Germany you do find people are more than happy to wear their specs - and to chop and change styles - and it's interesting to have a look at what's current in the optician's windows and see how many of those styles are already wrapped round people's heads!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2004, 00:53</p><p>Hi Plus Crazy, </p><p>in germany a lot of girls wear plus glasses for reading. Last week I saw two young girls, 16 or 17 years old, who bought reading glasses with +1,5 diopters. A female collegue, she is round 30 also wear full frame readers from the drugstore not only for reading. She take them off in the evening. </p><p>Michael</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus Crazy</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2004, 21:03</p><p>What tuns me most aboutglasses will be to hear m ife say, "Honey, please bring me those readers which are on the table.

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2004, 20:46</p><p>Tod: Well, to save time I could cheat and do THIS: </p><p> </p><p>I hate being this blunt or crude. I like the way some men look in glasses and the fact that they need to put them on each morning in order to function and to see. I just know that they get me hot, its a sexual arrousal thing. I want to be honest here. Their dependance on glasses, corrective lenses sets them apart from other men and makes them very special and perhaps strangely, more masculine. Some guys try to bypass glasses for vanity sake or other reasons by wearing contact lenses. But once known to be a contact wearer his lens wearing need takes on its own sensuality. I hope I have been some help here. You know, if we were all perfect it would be a very boring world. A handsome man who wears glasses is 10 times as sexy as a guy with perfect vision. ......... there is nothing more sexy in the world than a nearsighted man. Its true!</p><p></p><hr>

The myopia they inherited from me is a small price for them to pay.  I do not dwell on their eyes except here, as this is a site for that purpose.  I have good vision with my strong glasses; I assume you do too. Wearing strong glasses is hardly one of life's big handicaps.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>High Myope</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2004, 07:53</p><p>What turns me on about glasses is watching the progression of girls myopia as shown by the changing appearance of their lenses.  As a university professor, I have many myopic female students, at an age where myopia progresses rapidly.  Even those who usually wear contacts sometimes show up in glasses.  For moderate and high myopes, new frames are an excellent indication that theres more minus in the lenses, as evidenced by increased cut-in, flatter base curves and brighter power rings.  Sometimes, I even notice that new lenses have been inserted in the same frame.  One GWG who showed up as a freshman in the 6 range has turned up at the start of every semester with new glasses and now, as a graduating senior, has got to be at least 10. </p><p> </p><p>My 16 and 14 year old daughters inherited my nearsighted eyes and have exams every six months, inevitably resulting in stronger prescriptions.  We have tried every measure recommended by the doctor, including bifocals, hard contacts and reading glasses over contacts, but all have been ineffective, so I do not feel guilty about their ever-thickening lenses.  Indeed, I enjoy seeing them in their glasses, which are currently 12 and 8.  The younger one is squinting and tilting her glasses, so she will surely have stronger ones within a month or so. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>OTish</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2004, 17:11</p><p>Jason, </p><p>Women generally want a taller guy (than they are) because our society really looks down on any woman who is percieved to be big.

Aren't they afraid of rolling over and hurting them? And why don't tiny women go for guys closer to thier own size? Don't they get tired of having to tip thier heads so far back, and aren't they afraid of getting squashed? </p><p> </p><p>The good news for you is that when you hook up with someone, you will probably be able to feel good that she is really there for you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Progressives</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2004, 00:55</p><p>Clare,     Electra is right! I have always been strongly attracted to women with glasses, especially with a prescription like yours(-2.50). The rimless frames you describe, and your lens combo. must make you stunning. Someone does need to create a singles with glasses web site, so people like us could meet, chat ,etc</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2004, 18:22</p><p>Curt, yeah I figured that out after, sorry. I don't buy newspapers...long story, but I don't. But more reason to grumble really, as I can't obtain it!

But where to find him? Maybe your site should take personal ads!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2004, 11:11</p><p>Electra: Parade Magazine is the tabaloid-type insert that comes with many Sunday papers.  I don't believe you can buy it as a stand-alone document. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2004, 08:43</p><p>That would be a find. Anyone know if it's on-line? Where did you buy it?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>---</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2004, 08:26</p><p>speaking of contacts in photos, how about that closeup of Viggo Mortensen on the cover of Parade Magazine this week? Do you see evidence of contacts there? I thought I did.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2004, 06:16</p><p>This thread has been a bit quiet, so instead of posting my current thoughts to my Train of Consciousness page, I'm going to waffle on a bit here. Eustace reminded me how I DON'T like chains and cords that keeps a guy's glasses on. I understand that the gay guys like these, which may be why I don't - I find them effeminate. Yes, and that goes for you too Sting. Cut it out.  </p><p> </p><p>Next can I point out that red eyes are never sexy? Clear white is what we want. So, just say no to contacts. I was thinking about contacts a lot this week. Blame Johnny Depp. He disappointed me for not wearing his glasses to the Oscars, and I even had my hopes up when I saw him outside with his sharp new haircut and superb outfit that he just might thrill me, when he went into the building, with new glasses to complete the new look. maybe the rimless ones we've read about but never seen...but oh no. He wore contacts. You can see them in some of the better photos. I've spent more time than sanity would allow just looking for contacts in photos of celebrities lately - and on DVD's. It's hot stuff, because you can only just see them, and it just feels good because you know the man needs correction. But up close, I mean real close, in person, contacts look pretty weird. I have read on some threads how the guys like to watch girls put them in/take them out. Well, it just grosses me out! Keep your fingers out of your ears, nose AND eyes guys. Ugh. Anyway, where was I.......I do understand that celebrities often need to wear contacts when working, obviously. But I do wish they wouldn't offscreen/offstage. We need more photos to drool over. At least Johnny Depp lets us have plenty of those, but most don't. Considering MOST handsome movie stars (yes, MOST, the math is breathtaking, it's easily 75%) wear glasses SOMETIMES, these pictures should be easier to find, but I'm the Queen of Google and I have so much trouble finding them.  </p><p> </p><p>(And I get so little help, nag, nag) </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2003, 08:30</p><p>Jules, it is available for the Mac, but some 3rd party objects won't work on the Mac. Because they aren't tested on it beforehand creators don't know which work and which don't, so it's trial and error. Most sites put a disclaimer to the effect that Mac users are "on their own". There's very little support for Macs, but there is SOME. I HAVE seen some adult Sims that WILL work for Mac here: <a href="http://www.simplayhouse.com/wageofsim.htm" target="_blank">http://www.simplayhouse.com/wageofsim.htm</a> (scroll down to near the end) </p><p> </p><p>If you know your system well you may be able to troubleshoot. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2003, 03:12</p><p>Oh that's sweet! It's a game, for the PC. You get to play God really because you create people, well, Sims, and then you run their lives. At the basic level you decide on when they wake up, go to the bathroom, eat breakfast, go to work, etc, but with expansion packs (add-ons, more $$$ sadly) you finally get to tell them to do..anything. The actual Game itself is quite awesome, but what makes it so much fun is that hundreds of people create new items that work in the game. I'm not very good at this, but I'm getting better, what I have is mostly just altered a bit from other people. Some allow you to do this, some don't, you have to check their copyright info. The only limit really is your imagination. There are some limitations imposed by the gameplay and the strange version of 3D that it uses, but you can get round most of it. Today I'm going to put up some screenshots from the actual game itself of events taking place. Just to wet your appetite.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2003, 16:49</p><p>OK, I've joined. Maybe some day I'll find out what this is all about. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2003, 11:04</p><p>You're the only person who has shown an interest so far:( I will put some screenshots up, maybe that will lure a few more in.I'll set up a Yahoo group, they allow you to upload files. I can put it all there. I'll post back here as soon as I've set it all up. I just did it for my own fun initially. The Sims already has a wealth of user-created add-ons including a generous supply of adult requisites. Much of my items are just converted a bit. It wasn't that hard, you know, I just fiddled about a bit. The hardest part is getting them to sit still in a chair with "nothing to do", then a light bulb went on, so I now have an eye exam chart that they think is a TV. That's the sort of fiddlin' about I mean. hence, it isn't any great sacrifice to give it away free, you know? I mean come on adult+glasses fetish=fun, and they can't lock you up for it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2003, 17:39</p><p>I've discovered that growing old is not all that bad. I am over 50 and got divorced several years ago after a long marriage. I've learned there's one good thing about dating at this age. Most, if not almost all, women over 45 or so wear glasses. </p><p> Some wear reading glasses and even better many wear bifocals. And then many wore contacts for years, but have had to switch to glasses as their eyes have gotten older. Women over 45 also seem much less self conscious about wearing glasses. What's particularly interesting is watching someone go from reading glasses to bifocals part-time to wearing bifocals all the time.  </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

Head skins with myopic gaze. More......If this is popular I'll do more work. Currently toiling over a kinky optometrist office.

<p><b>Just Browsin</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2003, 21:26</p><p>Thanks Francine </p><p>I think it's more to do with the fact that I am not physically perfect. </p><p>I'm sure he thinks I don't really need to wear them, how could he possibly be married to someone who has eye problems. </p><p>I'm hoping that one day he will need to wear them! Can't wait lol.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Francine</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2003, 07:28</p><p>Dear Just Browsin, </p><p> </p><p>That is a sad story. There is no explaining what men like. It really doesn't have to do with logic or anything. I might hazard a guess as to why men like GWG but it's probably different for each guy. I will say that I took a look at one of the pictures of Courteney Cox with her glasses on, and IMO she looks more vulnerable and gentle that way. Without them she sometimes looks sort of tough. </p><p> </p><p>It's easy to feel like a victim in this situation, but maybe you have preferences about your husband's appearance, too. </p><p> </p><p>I might suggest contacts but it is up to you what you want to do. Marriage is a compromise; it's all too true. Maybe you could make a deal with him or something, like you will wear contacts if he shaves or bathes more often or something, LOL. </p><p> </p><p>Good luck... </p><p> </p><p>Fran</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Just Browsin</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2003, 07:17</p><p>To all the GWG 'S lovers out there, I think you are very special guys and only wish my husband was like you all. Why does he hate glasses so much? </p><p>I have been reading all of the threads for a few weeks now and would like to thank everyone for making me love my glasses. </p><p>I wear + glasses (sorry). My distance vision is adequate bare eyed, but I really need my glasses for reading and for anything else within 10 ft. </p><p>My husband hates me wearing them, so as he (luckily) works really long shifts, I only wear them when he's not around. </p><p>I need stronger lenses and am afraid to ask him for the money, so I wear two old pairs together - sad isn't it</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2003, 08:57</p><p>Bob, I think you are pretty safe in assuming that your girlfriend likes guys with glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2003, 08:57</p><p>Bob, </p><p> </p><p>I'd be very careful.  A lot of women think guys look cute in glasses, including myself.  I tend to find guys with glasses more attractive than guys who do not wear glasses.  But, that is in most cases a far cry from being an OO.  It's very likely that your girlfriend just thinks glasses look good on guys, but doesn't give it much thought beyond that.  Talk of GOC or anything like that would most likely freak her out.   </p><p> </p><p>So I'd assume she thinks guys with glasses are cute, but I would NOT assume she has a glasses "fetish."  Besides, fetishes in women are really rare anyway; most of us who think guys in glasses are cute could take them or leave them, and do NOT want them to play a special role in sexual play in any way. </p><p> </p><p>Lore</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2003, 08:00</p><p>My girlfriend and I have been dating for several months. Recently we were watching a television show together and she made an off the wall comment, almost to herself, that she was glad the host was wearing his glasses. I wear glasses. Her former boyfriend and her ex-husband also wear glasses. Should I assume she likes guys who wear glasses. She wears contacts herself. Haven't figured out a way to talk to her about this.</p><p></p><hr>

My favourite are a rimless pair with +2,50 but she said +1,00 are quite enough. So I bought this glasses and she looked great in their. The whole afternoon she wear it while shopping. I was very lucky. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom for Tammy</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2003, 05:37</p><p>Tammy! </p><p>Dear, I'd like to be close by you on the sofa to help you put on your glasses. What about you?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2003, 14:00</p><p>Johnny, a year or so ago i went to visit friends who were totally blind, or so i thought. Anyway, i spent much of the weekend going bareeyed. I think that she could see a little bit, as she did have a print enlarger that she used. Anyway, she wanted to know if someone was poking fun at her. I was too shocked to answer, and her boyfriend said "Not me". That's when i decided that if i came back to visit i was going to wear my glasses all the time i was there.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Johnnyb555</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2003, 13:45</p><p>Tammy, </p><p> </p><p>I had a friend who lived in California during the 1994 earthquake, whe was 32 at the time. She freaked out when it happened at 4am, as her -15/-16.50 glasses fell from her night table and she couldn't find them.  </p><p> </p><p>She had to walk outside bare eyed; her spares, clear and sunglasses, were in the car and she couldn't find the keys either. I had to come over to her apartment and rescue her -- at least she found her cell phone which worked. (it was pretty cool seeing her bare eyed though... didn't you go bare eyed for a day once?). </p><p> </p><p>J.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2003, 09:55</p><p>Puffin, I am -12.50/-11.00 currently, and when i take off my glasses, and lay them down on the sofa beside me, i can barely find them again. If it weren't for light reflecting off the lenses i might not be able to.</p><p></p><hr>

You're not alone, many of us are here. :-) Welcome. </p><p> </p><p>STINGRAY: My wife started wearing reading glasses a few years ago (+1.25 with astigmatism). Lost them soon after, and I got another pair for her, +2.50s. She complained about the power, so I found a cute little pair, red plastic, small round lenses in +1.50s, no complaints. I wish she would wear them full time. She doesn't know a thing about my GOC. I had her try on my -23s once, she hated them... what a blow. </p><p> </p><p>J. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2003, 07:30</p><p>This is pretty speculative Puffin, but with a pair of minus glasss it all depends on the distance, and the circumstances.  I would say that anyone over around -10D would have a hard time finding their glsses in a familiar room in good light.  In the same room, in poor lighting conditions you could probably drop to about -7D.  In a strange room, I think a -5D would have trouble even in fairly good lighting conditions, but a -3D would be fairly safe.  Now in a familiar room, in the dark, a -1D would have about as much trouble as a -20D.  See - it is all relative.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2003, 07:29</p><p>Puffin: it depends on the circumstances. But if you mean "when they are within arm's reach", then I think it's between -8 and -20...a wide range because black glasses sitting on a white table are going to be a lot easier to notice than if they're on a black table.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gl</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2003, 07:19</p><p>my girlfriend wears-20glassesand has astigmatism. If her glasses are moved from where she put them she is helpless in finding them as all she sees without her thick glasses is a big blob.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LongTimeLurker</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2003, 19:46</p><p>If I was walking past, I would like to think that I would "accidentally" stand on the glasses (repeatedly, if the situation required it), and then, after apologising profusely, take the it from there...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bianca</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2003, 05:47</p><p>I would help someone if they had lost their glasses, it would be a natural reaction I think.

<p><b>Martin</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2003, 02:23</p><p>Yeah, me too - the dependency really does it for me. I was in Wall-Mart yesterday and saw this really cute guy, tall, mid 20s, dark cropped hair and cargo pants. He was wearing small rimless glasses with about a -8 Rx and I thought, hey, I bet those specs are a nightmare to find. So I had this little vision of him patting down his bed after coming out of the shower and sticking his head really close to the bedsheets to see where they went to :) Kept me happy ...</p><p></p><hr>

But what if you saw someone lose their glasses, couldn't find them and there was no one else around? Would you help that person find his/her glasses or just stand back and observe to see what they would happen? I'm not sure how long someone who is completely helpless without their glasses would grope around for them before giving up or what they would do after that.

I guess it's a good thing to 'come out' really; I keep a low profile with friends in the real world, but I sometimes wonder how many others might share our interest. I was with a friend the other day - he's about my age and we've known each other prettyu well for over 3o year - admiring the young men in the street, and he remarked that he likes student-looking types..."short hair, and glasses, and that" and I really did wonder. Might find out some day. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>stingray</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2003, 09:05</p><p>As many of you know, I regularly post eyeglasses for sale on the marketplace segment of eyescene.  I sell quite a lot of eyeglasses on ebay.   </p><p> When people come over to visit us, my </p><p>wife remarks how I sell glasses on ebay and usually they are quite astonished.  The question I get all the time is "Who would buy other people's glasses?".  I just casually explain that there are collectors of just about anything out there and most of those people who buy the glasses are collectors either of the frames or lenses or both.  My wife then interjects that most of my buyers are eyeglass fetishists who get turned on by glasses.  Most of our friends are shocked to hear this.  My wife then informs our friends that us (me included) eyeglass fetishists kind of stalk people in public who are wearing glasses.  It seems we kind of get close to people and check out their glasses by peering through their lenses from the side of their face and wondering just how strong the prescription is.  "Egad!" they remark "There are people out there that do that?"  Yes, there are and we are harmless.  I am sure no one here nor have I ever had the urge to rip a pair of glasses off anyone's face .  My wife then remarks how there is a website on the internet entirely devoted to eyeglass fetishists.  Well, we all know what website she is referring to.  </p><p>By the way, my wife knows that I am an eyeglass fetishist myself and while I collect some glasses to sell, there are others in my inventory that I would never part with.  On rare occasions, my wife will put on a pair of these glasses to turn me on.  It works every time.  However, she is always afraid of germs and stuff, so I have to assure her that the glasses have been disinfected and cleaned.  She then examines them for herself before taking the risk of actually putting them on.  She is a myope who has glasses that are -3.75 or so and many times I ask her to determine the strength of newly acquired glasses by trying them on and comparing them to the strength of her glasses.  Most of the time she just says they are different which doesn't mean much to me, but I do like seeing her in different pairs of glasses just for the effect.  While I am comfortable discussing glasses with my wife, I have never had the nerve to suggest that I would like her to do glasses over contacts.  But then again, I can imagine, can't I?  I too would like to try GOC, but then again how would I ever explain this to her?  I guess I do not want to fall into a category of being a serious fetishist in her eyes (or a freak as most people would think us to be).  Sorry for rambling on and on.</p><p></p><hr>

I'm at  eyelovegwg@hotmail.com - one of my aliases  </p><p>Any she is petite  and trim with it, unnatural blonde, and wide honest face and pretty smile. Her eyes are bright blue and her glasses too, and they are wonderfully magnified,; she doesn't do eye make-up - there are difficulties I guess and I would love to apply some shadow and mascara for her, then put the glasses back on for her to revel in the look. </p><p>She's got new  glasses which I will see when next we meet - Keep you all posted.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Loonyettes</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2003, 12:29</p><p>Tell us more about her, Frank. I love plus wearers ... the lenses make them so mysterious. How does she feel about wearing glasses? And for that matter, how did you meet her? Yours nosily, Loonyettes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Frank</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2003, 15:58</p><p>Why thank you tortoise. There are many more where that came from.   </p><p>I have just read Loonyettes admission that he showed his girlfriend Eye Scene. I am thinking of doing the same with a woman I would like to become my lover. She is a strong plus wearer and has been since she was five she says, never overly confident of her attractiveness as a result, but a delightful person and very pretty, even without her glasses. </p><p>I have been fantasysing about how to tell her how she presses my buttons. Maybe I'll just take my clothes off in front of her, while she is equally free of such impediments, except for her glasses which she will have to keep on  - And like baking powder IT will be sure to rise. She may not make the connection. Anymore and I'll have to post in XXX link.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Databastard</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2003, 00:09</p><p>I've read statistics that at least 50% of boys like (or at least don't mind) girls who wear glasses. I think that at least puts to rest the idea that glasses are some kind of impediment to attractiveness. </p><p> </p><p>As far as people who are into glasses wearers, that can fall into a couple of categories. I'm sure some may just like it for dress-up in private. There are some who like glasses as part of a whole package, like dressing up as a nurse or librarian. Personally, I think glasses make a woman look ever better than without and usually warrent a second glance. That's probably the group most of the posters are in.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GWG's Rule!</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2003, 13:08</p><p>There is a difference between "OO's" who will post over here, and guys who just think girls with glasses are especially hot.  With the latter, it's a lot more common than you'd think, I'd guess over half of the males out there would agree that GWG's are cute.  But, again, that's not the same as being the type to research 'glasses fetish' in a search engine.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob W</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2003, 10:57</p><p>Hi! </p><p>My 2 bits. We might get some kind of gauge of frequency of GWG, or OO's, if we could somehow convince a woman with specs, not overly attractive or dressed up to attract, to go out with a couple of friends and hang out a bit where she could be observed. She plays with her glasses a bit, not playing up to anyone, and her friends note how many seem to be watching, by glancing around a bit. </p><p>Not very likely to happen, but I'd be curious. I've partially justified my own watching by assuming that there must be quite a few men who were interested in this. I might find a crushing reality that it's not so frequent! </p><p>Best regards, Bob W</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Frank</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2003, 03:03</p><p>I find I am coming out more and more - with people I trust not to laugh. ie male friends. </p><p>Years ago, during a period of sexual difficulty in an stormy and often traumatic six-year relationship, I confessed my OO and said it was all that really turned me on - and the reason for my non-performance at times was that she did not wear glasses (although she had an ornamental pair of gold wire-framed John Lennon glasses that she dressed up with at times - not often enough - and otherwise kept them in an old-fashioned glasses case.  </p><p>She said nothing at the time. </p><p>One night, when trying to get aroused was proving again difficult, she suddenly leapt from the bed and rummaged in a draw - I heard the tell tale snap of the glasses case and there she was, prancing back into bed with nothing on her girlish figure but a pair of gold-rims and big grin - and heightened my interest no end - as you British would say, Puffin. </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2003, 16:01</p><p>Elektra, </p><p>It is very difficult to tell how many people are closet, however something can be estimated.  </p><p>Just some examples: </p><p>There is a club at www.quick.cz called Silny bryle jsou nejhezci (Eng." Strong glasses are the nicest) founded by a reader of the Eye Scene. The club is in the Czech language and has 29 members, Only 3 of them have ever sent some contribution. One of them founded another fetishistic Czech club at the same server. So this is 3 to 29 at a club in a language spoken by some 12 mil people in the world. </p><p>The Glasses over contacts Yahoo group has 381 members, out of which about 50 have sent a contribution during last 12 months. About 8 people join and leave the group a week. I think all members of the group are readers and/or contributors of the Eye Scene discussion. </p><p>I meet a lot of new people in my job and sometimes I notice a person who mentiones glasses in such a way that I must consider the possibilty that he/she is ... however I never ask them. </p><p>So my opinion is that there are people who like GWG, MWG, glasses generally, or who have a kind of this obsession.  </p><p>This community is probably only a small part of the number of people. </p><p>I think I should sit and look back to find all moments when I met or heard about anybody who might be one of us ... :-) </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2003, 10:27</p><p>Familiar really? I used to post here a long time ago then lost it! But as I said it's risky owning up about any fetish (although people seem to brag about the *in* ones) because you'll quickly be labelled a freak or something. I wonder just how many people are closet. How many are reading this not daring to post. How many are ashamed even? I've learned to keep it a bit quiet but my list of favorite celebrities would tip off a fellow fetishist.

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2003, 11:51</p><p>Hey Hearty! I'm running late with this reply just wanted to tell you how I relate to the "flaw" thing. In trying to anylise just what it is about the BWG that make me go all funny I have always known at least that much. I had a really myopic boyfriend once, he got lost at the beach after a swim. Pity he was such a ditz, he was gorgeous. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>maddog</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2003, 11:24</p><p>There is a sexual interest which ties into this whole glasses and squinting thing. If my mother was nearsighted and power- squinted all the time, I would not in the least stand in awe and watch with interest, however if it is any female who is not my family and is below 55 or so, I would be attracted to watching her. Think about this, if you could spend time with a woman who was clad in a bikini at the beach, really well endowed who did not need eye correction, or spend time with a woman in a one- piece who was not built like a model but was nearsighted and had to squint every once in a while, which one would turn you on? I'd take any nearsighted woman any day over the most endowed woman on the planet.They make my world go round.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob W</b>&nbsp;30 May 2003, 15:20</p><p>Hi Angie, </p><p>Sorry it took so long to get back. It is getting really hard to explain the attraction or turn on. I thought it was about the woman being adventurous, or overcoming an obstacle, or being rebellious by resisting wearing her glasses, something of that order. Somehow I felt that very exciting and arousing. Usually it's when I notice a woman straining or squinting at something that attracts my attention. Othertimes, I'll see one walk up close to something to look at it, and I'll realize that she's nearsighted or I know she took off her glasses. I really seems pretty stupid when I write it down here. The woman is just trying to look at something, and she might be very self conscious of someone looking at her when she squints! That brings up a whole other matter about how she feels in that predicament in the first place. If the woman is actually having significant difficulties or distress, that's an immediate turn off! </p><p>That's probably as close as I can come to explain. It's been that way since 7 or 8 years old. There has been quite a discussion over in Psychology of glasses about some of this which is interesting. I'm going to post more of this there. </p><p>I've looked thru a lot of the archives. They are huge! There a several women who describe a freedom being bare eyed, as they call it here. Other women describe enjoying the soft blur, or as you put it, seeing things naturally. There are several who describe a thrill out of putting themselves in situations away from their glasses, forcing them to get along without. Then there are examples of women feeling aroused going around bare eyed with other women, or trading glasses while out or things like that. Their experiences run the whole gamut.  </p><p>I've run on quite a lot here. Again, sorry I didn't return earlier. </p><p>Best Regards, Bob W </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gus</b>&nbsp;25 May 2003, 22:02</p><p>Hearty - After they took away his glasses, did he somehow manage to get them back? I've been doing GOC with -21.5 glasses for a few months.

One time a couple guys ganged up on him, I guess they figured he was an easy mark, and he later told me, "they took my eyes from me" Of course, in those days lenses were thicker, so it's hard to tell. Ohh...I used to let him keep his specs on in the bedroom, because he really needed them...but sometimes I'd remove them and massage his eyes.

<p><b>ToTo</b>&nbsp;21 May 2003, 16:49</p><p>I was thrilled when discovering this site and reading about others' experiences. As I have a real turn-on for beautiful female feet and shoes, I can recall many memorable events as well. </p><p> </p><p>One of my most cherished is about my babysitting at Mrs Dynyncks house in Malibu. Back 2 years ago, I was 18 at the time, our neighbor asked me if I was available for a babysit evening at one of her friends. Since my agenda was free, I agreed and showed up at Mrs Dynynck's house by 8pm that night. I rang the bell, and was in a kind of shock when she opened the door. She stood almost 6 feet high, stylish light brown hair, she was wearing a summer outfit and was in incredible 2 inch heeled red leather open toed slippers. I followed her up the stairs to her little girl's bedroom and couldn't keep my eyes off her feet and the slapping slides that made her so unbelievably sexy. Audrey, her daughter, was already asleep so the evening promised to be a calm one... or maybe not. </p><p> </p><p>When she left for dinner with a friend, I noticed that she had changed into trendy sneakers. I waited for 10 minutes after she'd left, and went back upstairs searching for her slippers. Don't need to tell you my dick was rock hard by that time I quickly found her shoes in the bathroom and started unzipping my pants and unlacing my own shoes. On her washtable I noticed a pair of goldrimmed glasses, which explained her squinting when leading me through the house. I couldn't help trying on the glasses, while carressing my dick with the inner sole of her slipper and trying on the other one on my foot. She must have had a pretty strong prescription, since the bathroom started tolling in front of me when I had her glasses on. I found this kind of horny, knowing how nearsighted she was, and ket the glasses on. I inserted my dick through the front toe opening of her slide, and started rubbing it faster and faster over the white-leather inner sole of her shoe while the leather band of her slipper gently squeezed my willy. In the meantime I licked the inner of her slide, which tatsed like heaven. I started cumming streams of sperm within the minute, which flooded her slide and made the rubbing even more delightful. </p><p> </p><p>I repeated this "exercise" 3 times over the evening, using another pair of shoes as well. I'll tell you more about my adventures another time. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;15 May 2003, 16:03</p><p>A lot of people here are turned on by seeing other people wearing glasses, but I like fooling around with my own glasses.  On Lens Chat the other day, a guy asked me if I could see four ears when I looked in the mirror.  I had never thought of that before, but I could!  Two normal ears outside the frames and two smaller ears through the lenses  and four earrings, too! When I tried on my old (weaker) glasses, there were only two ears, there wasn't enough cut-in to see the little ones. </p><p>Another thing, I can see reflections of my cheeks and lights behind me through the side of the lens, sort of like cut-in in reverse.  It's more noticeable with these glasses.  On my old ones, the reflections are way out on the margins, and on the oldest ones, there aren't any.  That's a little annoying, but it's offset by the ghost reflections of lights in front of me.  When I first got glasses, they were very bright and annoying, and stayed close to the actual lights.  With each new pair, they have gotten smaller and moved further away from the actual light, and sort of faded out. </p><p>I also like to compare the size of the reflections when I take my glasses off to look at them.  As you probably know, there are two reflections on each surface, large and small.  On my first glasses, they were almost the same size, but as my RX has increased, the large reflections kept getting bigger.  On the latest glasses, the large reflection on the outer surface is way bigger than ever before.  For the first time, the two reflections on the inner surfaces go in opposite directions instead of the same way.  It's also interesting to look at the concentric circles and try to measure them.  I haven't figured out an exact way to do the measurement, but subjectively, each new pair of glasses has more circles than the previous one and each circle seems more prominent. </p><p>It's also fun to compare the minifying effect by holding glasses up to a measurable object, like tiles on the wall, and see how small things look.  I like to use the kitchen tiles in my house.  I start at a specific spot and hold the glasses out at arm's length.  Each lens opening is wide enough to cover 2-1/2 tiles, but with my oldest glasses , you can see 5 tiles.  With my last pair you can see 7, and with my current ones, 9 tiles fit into the same amount of space. </p><p>I'm not deliberately trying to make my eyes worse, but as long as my nearsightedness keeps progressing, I'm glad that each pair has a different appearance, which keeps wearing glasses from being boring. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob W</b>&nbsp;13 May 2003, 12:23</p><p>Hi Angie, </p><p> </p><p>I'll probably regret this, but at times do you enjoy looking through the blur? I'm refering to the part about looking at signs. In archives of this site, which are huge, there are many women who do. I was hoping Susanne DK would take note of your post in that regard.

<p><b>Hearty</b>&nbsp;13 May 2003, 00:03</p><p>Mmmmm, the vulnerability factor is a big part of it, for me! My ideal man is strong in appearance, yet has some fatal flaw....although I HAVE dated deliciously OBVIOUSLY vulnerable men, as well! Some have been overweight, underweight, even a man who had some slight brain damage and a limp. But the most compelling to me, is poor eyesight. </p><p>I wrote, many moons ago, about a blonde, long-haired dude I dated, who was extremely myopic....so much so, that he mainly wore thick, black glass lenses, because his eyes appeared so weak in clear lenses. However, his doctor told him that the constant darkness of the shades, would diminish his eyesight even more! </p><p>I was kinda flower-child-ish at that time....he had the long blonde, flashy hair, boots and earrings. We'd go out to the mall, and for some reason he'd play even more vulnerable than he was. He would lean on me, and it would make me feel strong! He'd lean on me and put his hand in the back pocket of my jeans, and I'd lead him around!! I loved the way people looked at us, with wonder (he looked soooo blind, but sexy too....the girls were attracted to him, and I definitely had to fend them off!!) I guess, as we've said before, there can be an amount of exhibitionism involved in this. </p><p>Now, as I am searching for a soul mate to share the long haul with, I am TRYING very hard, to see the real man first, and not just look for one with a flaw or weakness...perhaps fate will be kind to me (or have a sense of humor!) and lead me to a true heart, who just happens to have a beautiful, vulnerable streak, as well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>angie</b>&nbsp;11 May 2003, 01:34</p><p>i'm a 20 y/o college student and i've been wearing glasses all my life.  i used to want contacts but now i know i look much better with a good pair of frames than without anything on my face.  they make me look older and smarter.  they're like my favorite accessort now.  and i think glasses were sexy on both men and women, especially the black frames that are in style now.  they make women look so intelligent and powerful and they make young men look mch more serious.  especially with dressy clothes, they're great.  i guess i also like the 'christmas package' aspect, but in reverse.  most people are reluctant to wear their glasses in public, so seeing them with glasses on is a private serious kind of thing.  i remember when i was with this girl who never wore glasses and one night i slept over her place.  i woke up and there she was sitting up in bed, reading a book with glasses on.  it was so cute.  that was when i realized that glasses can really change the way you look. </p><p> </p><p>but i didn't know it was a serious fetish for some people until i came upon this site and started reading about why peolple like gwg.  the day after i saw this site i was so much more conscious of my glasses.  i fidget with them a lot it seems.  they slide down and i have to push them back up and blink to adjust, or i take them off and clean them with the edge of my sleeve when they're smudged, or sometimes i take them off to read a book and suck on the earpiece, or  i take them off to read a sign even though i'm nearsighted, and then i have to squint at the sign.  i never knew till this site but that must drive some gwg lovers crazy!  now sometimes when i'm out in public i realize i'm fidgeting with them and i wonder if a gwg lover is enjoying it.  its weird to think a little habit like that would excite someone but it also makes me feel kind of special</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JM</b>&nbsp;09 May 2003, 05:03</p><p>been lurking for a while.  iam a 35 yr old male  and i love women in low to  medium lenses. i love seeing them squint to see far or strain to read.and putting their specs on. i actually secretly enjoy wearing glasses i find at used clothing stores. i usually go for bifocals- as long as i can see a little with them. i guess this makes me a glasses freak</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gus</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2003, 21:29</p><p>What turns me on about glasses is wearing GOC with +14 contacts and -17 glasses. What I really like to do is to pretend to have lost my glasses since everything is a total blur with just the contacts. I kind of like feeling vulnerable. I'm trying to work up the nerve to try it in public. Something like driving to campus and walking about a mile away. Then at the right time, I would put my glasses in my pocket and act like I had lost them. I would litterally have to feel my way back. I was reading some posts in the archives where some of the women on ES (Suazanne I think was one of them) mentioned that going barefoot made them feel more vulnerable. Does anyone think that this might work well with the lost glasses act?</p><p></p><hr>

She normally wears contacts and is very sensitive about her appearance with glasses, which I've yet to see. Her objections to glasses are the decreased peripheral vision, thickness of the lenses and the limited number of frame styles that will handle her Rx. She is serious about Lasik. How can I convince her of the downside of surgery and that she's not doomed to, as she puts it, "butt-ugly frames" and how do I do this without sounding like an OO?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob W</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2003, 11:08</p><p>I posted this to the Joy of Spex site, I probably am totally off my rocker, but I wanted to try and influence them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I am wondering how you hope this site will develop. I tumbled on this from </p><p>the "Eye Scene" site, which, of itself, isn't a porn site. It's where all kinds </p><p>of folks interested in all aspects of glasses communicate, text only. There are </p><p>areas for porn postings, but most of it isn't. I was hoping to find a "soft" site </p><p>to entertain my interests. I think there are lots out there who have similar interests </p><p>to mine, could be wrong though. </p><p> </p><p>Are you getting into this because of so many regular sites popping up causing too </p><p>much competition? I really don't go looking around for porn, but I was amazed at </p><p>how many and how aggressively marketed the sites are, while looking around for </p><p>sites of my interest. Had you ever considered a "lite" side to your site besides </p><p>what you have to offer. I'm gauging by Leila's and Becca's current sites. I'm not </p><p>a member of either one, but they appear to be regular porn, but Leila wears her </p><p>glasses some, I guess. It looks like you would be doing the same, but wearing </p><p>your glasses to catch a little different group. </p><p> </p><p>On the very soft side: </p><p>There are sites with galleries of pics of women who really wear glasses with their </p><p>glasses, such as "Girls'n'Glasses" ( <a href="http://kickme.to/gng" target="_blank">http://kickme.to/gng</a> ), or "Eddy's GWG Page" </p><p>( <a href="http://www.geocities.com/eddy2001l/" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/eddy2001l/</a> ). There is a site with models wearing  </p><p>frames without real lenses, though a few are real. These are pretty limited in </p><p>erotic appeal. </p><p> </p><p>A good site to explain the obsession like I have is "Those Girls with Glasses" </p><p>( <a href="http://www.geocities.com/likeglass55/" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/likeglass55/</a> ). He can certainly explain it better than </p><p>most, as well as the range of interests. The "Eye Scene" site  </p><p>( <a href="http://eyescene.net/" target="_blank">http://eyescene.net/</a> ) is years old, and text only. It can be tedious </p><p>going through it to find out the erotic interests, except the Fetish, XXX links  </p><p>thread, which is the hard core porn crew. There, you will find the term Optic </p><p>Obsessive. That would fit me very well. I downloaded your pics and blew them up </p><p>a little to see if I could find out roughly your prescriptions. The breasts and </p><p>peeing just gets in the way! Becca looks like -3 or -3.5?, can't really tell about </p><p>Gala, Leila might be -2.5, and/or astigmatism, Rose seems to be strong minus, like </p><p>-6 or so, and Starri seems to be in the -2 range. I'm no expert, but you get the idea </p><p>about where my interests lie. I didn't try and figure out bust/cup sizes, or </p><p>Leila's bladder capacity, or problem. </p><p> </p><p>I get really excited when some nearsighted woman is explaining what she can and can't </p><p>see at such and such distance without her specs, or describing going around </p><p>without them. A good example of this can be found in the Rx section, Post your </p><p>Prescription, click the "view all posts" link, and then search for Clare around </p><p>June 2002 and a few months after. She clearly was not </p><p> intending any erotic arousal </p><p>for anybody. </p><p> </p><p>If you want to explore this further, go back to the home page, and follow the links </p><p>to the archives. When you finally get to the files, you will find "Polls80.zip". </p><p>Download this and unzip it. It's html. In Polls 82 thru 84, Becky describes </p><p>enjoying pushing herself to go without her specs in a variety of situations </p><p>because she enjoyed the challenge. Again, not overtly erotic intent, but for men </p><p>like me, this is powerful stuff. For overtly erotic stuff, look up Susanne DK, </p><p>starting in Polls 81, and Caitlin, starting in Polls 80. These two, and their </p><p>partners really get off on playing with their glasses, trading, teasing, going </p><p>out without, etc. </p><p> </p><p>This all has little to do with humiliation, disability, or things like that. </p><p>For the severely nearsighted, like -8 or -10 and above, the men do get excited </p><p>about the helplessness, but also very much about the distortion that the lenses </p><p>provide. In the mild to moderate nearsighted, it's much more the overcoming </p><p>the difficulties, flaunting or showing off the nearsighted eyes, as well as </p><p>the mystery of the lenses. There can also be the mystery, can she really not </p><p>see it? Never really being sure since she acts like she does see ok otherwise. </p><p> </p><p>Is this anything you had considered at all? All of this was in text only, and I </p><p>found it was pretty strong. It appears others did too, but I can't prove it. </p><p>If you haven't played with this sort of thing yourselves, and it isn't too  </p><p>demeaning, you might try a short trial run yourselves in real life to see </p><p>what kind of response you can get without really getting into a coming on </p><p>to anyone kind of situation, much less any other kinky dress or behavior. </p><p> </p><p>Dream up some short scenario for yourself with one or a couple girlfriends. A </p><p>few important things. It has to be real. You really can or cannot see it, and </p><p>you are doing this for your own entertainment, oblivious to anyone else </p><p>watching or noticing. Someone, not directly involved (who can see) can glance </p><p>a little at a time to try to gauge the response in general. You wouldn't be </p><p>drawing attention to yourselves by talking loudly or gesturing wildly either. </p><p>Let the glasses and those beautiful nearsighted eyes do all of the attracting. </p><p>The worst would be that very few would pay any attention. </p><p> </p><p>Some scenario could be walking together, or seated at a mall, talking, remove </p><p>glasses, but don't put them down, The power and mystery lies in being able to </p><p>see the images being distorted through your lenses! Perhaps nibble on the  </p><p>temples a little, or just hold them up, casually move them around, slowly. </p><p>Look towards something, a little straining trying to focus, squint, raise the </p><p>glasses to the end of your nose, squint, then back down. Or trade glasses with </p><p>your friend, comparing what you can see with hers with the other way around, </p><p>or if one has strong glasses compared to the other, the one with strong glasses </p><p>try the weaker glasses to see, and the other compare what she can see </p><p>without. Or both compare what they can or can't see without. Any combination </p><p>in between. By now you can get the idea. </p><p> </p><p>Any reaction to this would be welcome, particularly questions.

<p><b>maddog</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2003, 10:57</p><p> I guess if you think you have a twisted mind, then I have one too, because I think squinting, nearsighted women are the best. Glasses are somewhat erotic themselves, but the thought of a nearsighted woman squinting without her glasses on takes up most of my thoughts during my day. I don't know why, but it does. There are probably millions of myopic women that do it daily and have no idea that it is an arousing sight.</p><p></p><hr>

Is there much interest in sites that stick to the women with glasses, the interaction/space between their eyes and specs, without the "porn" part. </p><p> </p><p>For myself, reading the posts of mild to moderately nearsighted women describing going bare eyed, or straining/squinting to see, is very exciting. It might be upsetting to them to know that this perverted and twisted mind could twist it in this disgusting manner. When reading their posts, it's clear that the women posting it were not intending that. </p><p> </p><p>The exception would be in the archives with women like Susanne DK and Caitlin who themselves got off on it.

<p><b>Bob</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2003, 03:29</p><p>So, what the hell is the big deal about fakes. This is the Internet, where a fat middle aged loser can pretend he or she is a rich 30-year-old movie star. We are all fakes. We all look and post to this web site because we are embarassed, ashamed or for some reason unable to talk in the real world about the fact that we like glasses and we like the way people look when they wear glasses. Who the hell knows who or what any of us are? I actually stopped posting and even for a while stopped visiting this site a few years ago when I was accused of being a fake. I guess maybe I am a fake, because I sure express things on here I would never in a million years talk about in my real life, whatever the hell that is. Everybody is on here for a different reason. We all have a different fantasy. I personally like to read stories about people who need glasses, get glasses and eventually wear them all the time. I am a smart person, college degree, lots of life experiences. I know many if not most of these stories are not true. You can usually tell from the language if a person claiming to be an 18-year-old girl is really a 60-year-old glasses obsessed man. This is just a little diversion, a few minutes with people who share what most people consider a very strange diversion. Lets just let people people be what they want to be on here. And if you don't think the whole Internet is one big fantasy land, go to one of those Internet dating sites, and read the post from the beautiful, thin young woman with long blond hair and a body to kill for. Then go find her and meet her and you'll find a 53-year-old sad and lonely divorcee, who turns out to be a lot like yourself. None of this real. Cut the foolishness and lets get back to talking about glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2003, 05:04</p><p>I'm not really into making a big deal about fakes.  I can kind of relate to where they're coming from.  They used to bother me, because I wanted to learn things about eyes and glasses and so it was a pain to not be sure what to believe.  Now I don't really care.  I sort of assume there's a decent portion of the posters here where their reality differs markedly from their posts.  It's interesting how the more fascinating the post, the more likely it is to be a fake.  Don't underestimate me - I guess when I wrote "Absolutely fantastic, even" I should have put a "(wink)" in there too.  C(r)ool Dude, I can see the point of trying to discourage false posting, because I think we are likely to feel like eyescene is more meaningful if we feel that it is real - the posters are real.  I'm just not really into worrying about it.  In a way, this site represents a fantasy, a place where - unlike in the real world - I can be open about the degree to which I like glasses and it wouldn't be crazy of me to admit that I'm 100 times more likely to notice a girl wearing glasses than one not wearing glasses.  OK, so a girl wearing 3/4" thick glasses that are always falling off her face is obviously not a real girl...but damn, it would be awesome if she were.  Glassesluver told us a little about what turns him on about glasses, in a more interesting way than most of the others on this thread.  This does seem a little more admissible to me than someone posting on "Post Your Prescription" saying they have -65D -15.5D axis 32, 22 Base-In, +7.5 Add quintrifocals. </p><p> </p><p>Val: C(r)ool Dude meant "loser", I'm fairly confident.

<p><b>glassesluver</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2003, 07:30</p><p>thanks for the response Alan.First  iforgot to respond to one of your questions  in your last post. I started dating her because of her not her glasses but then developed an intense infactuation for her thick loose glasses.I really think she must have another pair that fit better that she wears when she is not with me because as you said it could be daangerous for her and I don't understand hope she could cope if she lost them.Some people in lens chat said perhaps she wears the looses ones for her own reasons when she  is with me. I havenever asked her,but after chatting with people her i intend to .she moved across country and i am flying out to see her next weekend.anyways  ,if she does wear other glasses which i am begining to think she has to to function i hope she will still where the loose ones for me that turn me on......weird huh?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2003, 05:56</p><p>Glassesluver - that's a pretty amazing scenario.  I think it's pretty crazy that she would wear her glasses loose and not try as hard as she could to keep them from ever falling off (since that could be pretty hazardous to her). </p><p> </p><p>As for being ashamed, if you *are* as obsessed with her as you are with her glasses, then you're probably in an excellent position.  Absolutely fantastic, even.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glassesluver</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2003, 14:52</p><p>i would appreciate others comments obout my obssesion with my girlfriends glasses as i wrote about in several posts belo. thenks in advance for your responses</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Billy</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2003, 14:09</p><p>Back in 1971, when I was almost ready to leave school, I want to the school christmas disco. I met a girl who I had known on and off but nothing serious, and, she wore glasses. On the disco night, she turned up wearing fashionable clothes, with lots of jewellery and, new glasses!They were typical early 1970s fashion, being large octagonal gold  metal frames, worn slightly "off" the nose, she looked absolutely fantastic! We danced all night to T-Rex, Mungo Jerry, and the like. We decided to take a walk later on, and went out to the football  field. It was frosty, and I can recall her saying how her new metal framed glasses felt cold in the frosty weather. We stopped to chat,held each other and listened to the music from the disco, it was playing a slow instrumental number called "I will return" by a one hit wonder band,called "Springwater". We eventually kissed. It was my first ever kiss.I eventually married a girl who had 20-20 vision and still has, I now wear glasses myself as presbyopia takes an ever increasing grip, but I still can't kiss my wife outdoors, without thinking of that night, all those years ago back in 1971...... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glassesluver</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2003, 14:07</p><p>She has moved across the country and i cannot wait until next week end when I fly out tto see her. I am almost ashamed that I am obssesed with her glasses almost as much as i am with her. I canit wait to see those glasses slipping and push them back up and have them almost turn me on as much as she does</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glassesluver</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2003, 12:03</p><p>I would guess her glasses are at least3/4 thick or more.They are inblack plastic frames . The sides of the frames go straight back and do not hook over her ears, i think that fact and the weight of the lenses cause them to slp and fall off. Yes I have seen them falll off many times when we fool around and goof off .Many times I have held them on her face  to keep them from sliding or falling off. She is lucky they have not broken otherwise whe would be up a creek. Helping her with her thick heavy glasses is a treat for me  and  perhaps she is entertaining me like you said ..i hope so that would be great </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2003, 11:45</p><p>Glassesluver - How many times have you seen her glasses fall off?  How large are your girlfriend's frames?  And how thick are the lenses?  (You said 'extremely', but can you guess a measurement?) </p><p> </p><p>You can probably ask her in a kind way why she has her glasses worn loosely.  She might tell you it's because she finds them more comfortable that way, but perhaps it is to entertain you really.   </p><p> </p><p>Were you attracted to her because of her glasses? </p><p> </p><p>(No, I don't think this is weird at all.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glassesluver</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2003, 11:19</p><p>thanks for the reply. i was begining to think i was odd that i enjoyed her thick glasses almost as much as her as my girlfriend.I haven't asked her how she gets buy wearing them so loose , it seems it would bother her. I am begining to think she really does have another pair to put on when i am not around.if her looses ones fell off and she couldn't find them she would be totally helpless. Anyways thanks for telling me that i am not wierd for feeling that way about her glasses turning me on when theynslip or slide off.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2003, 10:07</p><p>I've heard all that before and it does not seem in the least bit weird to me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glassesluver</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2003, 04:14</p><p>I am new to this site and this is my first post. My girlfriend is a beatiful wonderful person. However she wears extremely thick glasses. I have found myself becoming infactuated with her glasses. They seem to add to her beaty and are like icing on the cake.I especially like it when they slip down her nose and i push them back up for her or if they fall off and i have to help her find them.She cannot see without the glasses. She seems to like it when i help her with her loose glasses.I oftenwonder how she manages when no one is with herand they would slip off. Can anyone advise me if they think i am abnormal for enjoying her thick glasses.Also someone in the chat room said she probably has a better fitting pair of glasses that she wears when she is not with me and that she probably wears the loose ines because she knows I like them.Do you think this is possible . The loose glasses are beatifulbut the have sides that go straight back and do not hook over her ears.I think that the weight of her thick lenses pull them down her nose and allow them to fall ,however I love the way they look when she has her hair tied backand I can see the sides as well as her thick glasses.......am i weird or what.She freaks out if she can't get her glasses back on right away so i don't understand why she takes a chance on losing her glasses if they are so loose but it it is such a turn on to help her with them. any responses would be appreciated </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2003, 07:42</p><p>Tony -- There are people who are turned on by hearing aids.  I think there have been some posts to eyescene where people have said they were, and at any rate, some of the reasons glasses might be a turn on could also apply to hearing aids -- the perception of weakness or vulnerability, some sense of emotional charge attached to the glasses or hearing aids. </p><p> </p><p>Then again, glasses seem to be broadly considered a *lot* more fashionable than hearing aids.  I had about 4 discussions with various people this past weekend (including two in a bar) where I heard, among other things, the opinion that men look sexier in glasses.  I wouldn't expect too many people to say the same thing about hearing aids at this point.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2003, 06:08</p><p>Regarding the squinting discussion, does anyone know, generally speaking, how much it makes things clearer by?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2003, 06:01</p><p>Portia: I asked my eye doc about the pinehole test.  He said that is was used to find out if your vision problems are purely refractive, or if there is some underlying pathological (disease) reason why you can't see well.  Whether you are nearsighted, farsighted or astigmatic, if you look through a pinhole the image should be relatively clear.  I was told this is because the light rays coming through a pinhole are parallel, and hit the eye squarely.  Apparently it is the light rays come in at less than parallel to your eye that our eyes cannot focus (if we have visual defects). </p><p>My doc has narrowed the chart down to one line, but never to one letter.  The other test that I find fascinating is when the doc purposely gives you double vision, and then asks you to focus on the acuity in one of the images.  I suspect this is to see how the eye sees when binocular fusion (taking the image that each eye sees and making them into one image) is taken out of play. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2003, 01:42</p><p>Squinting...sometimes they do it for you. </p><p> </p><p>Anyone else ever had a pinhole lens used as part of an eye exam? How about when the examiner narrows down the eye chart to just a line, or just one letter? </p><p> </p><p>With the examiners "cheating" on behalf of the patient, it makes me think they don't want us to get thicker lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2003, 11:10</p><p>It's a fact of physics that the smaller the aperture an aimage comes through, the less the blur because there are fewer 'rays' of light to diffuse in diffeent directions (I haven't put that well, I know). This is the principle of the pinhole camera and those funny specs with slits instead of lenses people occasionally advertise from South Africa. So, suqinting by reducing the size of the eye aperture improves clarity, for both myopes and hyperopes. I have occasionally seen a hyperope squint just like a myope, and a presbyope hold two fingers pinnched in front of an eye to read without findin his glasses - and I can read without too much difficulty if I screw my eyes up and squint at the page. </p><p>I think myopes perhaps squint by instinct rather than observation. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anders</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2003, 09:07</p><p>Mad Dog, I recommend getting your hair cut at a men-and-women place.  They are magically and wondrously full of squinting women.  Had the experience just yesterday.  Enjoy!  Anders</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mad dog</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2003, 06:31</p><p>I have searched for information about why squinting helps from the internet, but this is the only place where anyone ever talks about myopia and squinting. I know we all squint when the sun is shining in our eyes, however, do we learn from seeing others squint that it helps in seeing distant objects or is this a natural reflex of the human body? Male or female, it is an arousing sight for me and I tried to supress my intense interest in myopic squinting and my interest in glasses. I could never have been an optician because I would always be putting patients into a position where they would be straining to see. Some guys like Penthouse, Playboy and nudity. I could see a female squint and the same erotic feelings rise up. It's just cool and hot at the same time. Maybe some of you can understand. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Teah</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2003, 10:50</p><p>sure they do! before I got glasses, i would squint around like hell trying to see things. it was pretty pathetic. i would squint all the time, even on eye test, so i just barely passed them for a long time without knowing i had a problem. then one day a friend was like...Teah....you're not supposed to do that...you should get glasses then.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mad dog</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2003, 10:27</p><p>Before glasses were invented, I wonder if humans ever squinted? After someone gets glasses and sees how clear everything is, then usually you'll see some squinting  if his or her glasses are not on. But if no one who was myopic knew how the world looked through glasses, they would not know to try to squint to see better. Just wondering.</p><p></p><hr>

So the next week we both went to the eyedoctor and I just watched her doing the eye-test, the eyedoctor said something like "you really really need glasses, you have definetely weak eyes". we went to the optician then and tried many frames, it was really sweet to see her tryin on those and it made me go insane when she was wearing glasses for the first time. one night we went out and she got really drunk, and combined with her low vision she wasn't able to find the car, (I was sober and drove) and she giggled that I should help her 'cause she could not see anything at all, well...

I don't know what it is and why it is that way, but it is always a flash when I see a woman wearing glasses especially when I see her the first time doing that. But there are so many pictures of women wearing specs in the web which I find just boring and don't turn me on at all, </p><p>so I guess that is no real fetish, more a preference, what do you people think about it? And a real fetish means that you need the object of your fetish to be turned on. My girlfriend wears contacts and from time to time she wears her specs too(med-myope I'd say) and that's definetely something sweet, and I always tell her that, but I would not try to convince her of wearing glasses full-time, it's cool when she wears 'em, it's a fine surprise, like when a woman surprises you by wearing hot lingerie or something... and I know many people who feel about that the same way... now would you call that fetish or preference??? </p><p> </p><p>all the best </p><p>Liam</p><p></p><hr>

Well, I spent these two days with my girl friend nad it was soo good, making love on New Years Eve, looking at her nice bespectacled face. I even put my -20s on her nose, and it was good and very hot. The details are XXX rated, so I will not tell you, he he. </p><p>However. We were talking about the fetish thing too. I tried to explain her some issues, but it is really difficult. I mean, it is. that is the only fact I am sure of. I do not know when and how and why it began. I have tried to find out answers to the questions, but my research has not been successful. The only think I am sure of is, that this site is very important for all of us OOs (optic obsessive people) because it helped many of us to find peace in our minds. Some of us thought they were not normal, some even thought they were deviant. We found out we were not alone who had the similar feelings. It is good to know we are not alone. It is also good to know we are normal, although we may have rather non standard feelings. </p><p>And those concentric rings ... hmmmm ... they are beautiful they make the glasses really nice like a piece of jewellery, yes, that is the right word, a piece of beautiful jewellery - like nice ear rings, like a necklace, like piercing. </p><p>Everything just depends on a point of view. If somebody says themselves that the thick lens is ugly it will ugly for them, and vice versa ... you know, for most of us here the thick lens is nice. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2003, 14:31</p><p>I like the aesthetic qualities of glasses, the thicker ones are better and much more visually interesting (!) </p><p>I love the way they trap light and then release it in lovely concentric rings. </p><p>Sigh! :) </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>High myope</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2003, 11:58</p><p>I like looking at girls and women who are myopic, but not so extremely so that they look grotesque in glasses.  I guess my favorites have an RX between about -4 and -8 with front surfaces that are almost but not completely flat.  Stronger RXs are OK too provided the frames are small and the lenses hi-index so they don't look weird.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2003, 11:35</p><p>Tony </p><p>In answer to your question, I know WHAT turns me on, even if I'm not sure why. (I do, however, have some ideas, which I may share with our readers at some future time, if anyone is interested).  </p><p>Strong lenses on a pretty girl, that's what. The stronger the better, of course, and I don't mind whether they're plus or minus, as long as they are strong.  </p><p>I also agree with the previous posters who said that ill-chosen frames can detract from the appearance, and any face is enahanced by well-chosen frames. I have to say that the stronger the lenses, for me the less pretty the face needs to be.

That probably scarred my wife's opinion about glasses, but she's okay with them.My mother-in-law would flip if she knew that some of us love girls in glasses, even glasses themselves without the girls, squinting, power rings, and refraction. Of course, so would everyone else in my family. That's why only my wife knows about my intense interest in vision.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;22 Dec 2002, 01:04</p><p>OK, now I REALLY want People Mag to do the same survey with a bunch of women.  That will be interesting.  I'm scared about the outcome, but optimistic.  (The outcome really just has to do with the glasses and whether they fit the wearer well enough, but I'm not sure I trust celebrities' fashion sense very much!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;22 Dec 2002, 01:02</p><p>I think I've decided once and for all that the vast majority of people seem to think that if *they* wear glasses, then it means everything bad (weakness, dorky-ness, whatever).  But these very same people think glasses look good on other people. </p><p> </p><p>Proof: </p><p> </p><p>That great pronouncer of truth, People Magazine, in their Dec 2 issue, published results from a survey I think we saw online a while back.  Out of 8 male celebrities (all of whom are considered, at least by many, to be RAG's - Really Attractive Guys), 5 were considered by the pop-culture masses to look BETTER in glasses.  The ones who were voted to look better without glasses were either wearing glasses that were a bad fit (Matthew Perry) or it was just a bad picture (Adam Sandler - the 'with glasses' picture has him with a realy dorky smile).  And there were enough votes that (unless we all voted many, many times) Eyescene couldn't have really skewed the verdict too much.  Besides, if we did skew it a lot, then all the guys would have looked better with glasses, according to the voting! </p><p> </p><p>So people like glasses, on other people.  And the 'weakness' thing definitely doesn't figure in, because this voting was on *men*, who are "supposed" to be strong, not weak.   </p><p> </p><p>But people are still reluctanct to wear glasses themselves.  Why?  They see themselves differently, it seems.  Very odd. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2002, 12:22</p><p>No-one wore glasses in my family - though I do remember my father once coming home after a medical check at work - and he said he might have to wear glasses. He never did. He's only recently succumbed to readers - same as my mother. I don't recall that my family was ever anti-glasses. The subject never cropped up in conversation. I eventually got glasses when I was 30 - and one of my brothers got them around the same time. Only one of my many cousins was a full-time glasses wearer.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2002, 10:22</p><p>RE: Musey's comment about wearing glasses=weakness. </p><p> </p><p>There was a lot of that sort of attitude years ago. Do YOUR parents have anything resembling the knowlege about vision and glasses of this group? I can't be the only one whose parents passed on the idea that wearing glasses, especially for a girl, was a horrible fate. Or said things like, "She'd be so pretty without those glasses". </p><p> </p><p>I hope people growing up today are not getting the "all glasses are bad" message that was pervasive when I was younger. Or the unforgettable, "Glasses are for old people, why does your daughter need them in first grade?" Just credit it to ignorance, I guess. As a child, most of the time I refused to wear the damned things and there are almost no photographs of me in glasses to this day.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Musey</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2002, 01:21</p><p>Alan, I know you're right, and I'm trying to overcome that habit, but I think it stems from the fact that my folks only wore glasses for reading, and I know my Dad always thought it was a sign of weakness to need glasses for distance.

She was wearing -5's at least in a thin plastic light frame. She came to a van right in front of me and yelled at her mate to get out and pick up this bag. He wouln't get out and she had to pick it up and put it in the van. Another GWG that probably gets treated like trash, I thought.I would have loved to know what it was like to see through her glasses and how limited her vision was.

See, the odds of something fairly bad happening after having lasik done is about 1000 times more likely than winning the lottery...yet a lot of people buy lottery tickets all the time.  (Well, and a lot of people have lasik...basically people can easily warp their perception of probability in a way that makes them feel better.) </p><p> </p><p>Do you think your boyfriend would understand your feelings about glasses?  Actually, what *are* your feelings about glasses -- I mean, are you always more attracted to someone who wears glasses?  If your b/f had surgery, would you lose interest in him, or just be sad?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Marvin</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2002, 00:04</p><p>Thanks for the responses!  Yes, I've recently told my boyfriend that I like the way he looks in glasses, and I'd be sad if he got surgery.  But he is soooo bitter about "being blind." He feels like he has been "cursed" with bad eyesight.  Oh, what I would do to be a  </p><p>-5!  He thinks my real perscription is somewhere in the higher minus threes when it's really barely a -2, so when he complains about his bad eyes, I pretend that I know what it feels like not to be able to see, but that I just have a different outlook about my "bad" eyes.  I suggested that sometimes it can be nice to choose whether or not to see fuzzy...etc etc, I've tried to act as if I'm not really very emotional about the issue but just have a preference.  Of course when he starts actually taking the steps towards finding a lazer surgery doctor, I'm going to start feeling desperate!  Aghh, why oh why did science have to discover lazer surgery!  </p><p> Julian, I think I will definitely start looking up horror stories online, of course like you, the few people I know who actually had the surgery, including my step father, were just raving about how GREAT it is hmph. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Dec 2002, 03:33</p><p>Marvin: there is plenty of stuff on the web. I seem to remember a site called 'I know why refractive surgeons wear glasses'. I had one or two horror soriues I'd saved but I cleared them out the other day 8) - there was one about a woman who had surgery; her tear ducts dried uyp? got blocked? her eye lashes wera causing ulcers on her corneas; she was unable to work; got into clinical depression; attempted suicide several times and was rescued; and finally her husband decided she'd had enough and helped her to end it all. There was also a young guy who wore -12s till he had surgery; after a few months he had to start wearing glasses again (admittedly not as strong) and wished he'd stayed as he was. I think these have all been linked from Eye Scene, so if you search through the topics you ought to find some links; and I think if you can search the archive of the previous BBS there was a whole topic devoted to this. You could do a search using Google or another search engine. </p><p>Or of course you could just persuade him that my motto is the right one: SPEXY GUYS ARE SEXY GUYS! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p>On the other hand the only person I actually know who'd had it done is delighted with the results. I'm not; I thought he was wonderfully sexy in specs; but he's certainly seeing better.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;18 Dec 2002, 01:14</p><p>Marvin -- does your b/f know you like him in glasses?  Why does he want surgery?    </p><p>   Well, there really are lots of bad things about it.  Vision is typically not quite as good afterward.  There can be real problems, both with quality of vision and discomfort (sometimes major).  It's not a good idea unless a person has a very strong reason for wanting it and is willing to accept some loss of best-possible-vision in order to get sort of decent vision without correction. </p><p> </p><p>Musey -- Get rid of that habit!  :)  Seriously, glasses photograph just fine.  Leave them on...if you wear glasses, then you-with-them-on is the real you, right? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

I am interested in all matters related to vision problems and glasses. </p><p>I wear specs myself since I was 12 and I was taken for my first eye test.My first prescription was about -0.5D both eyes.I was impressed how clear I could see when I was given my first glasses.Since then I started to be interested in all that things on scientific way(causes of myopia,methods of vision correction).On the second hadn I always looked at glasses and lenses as a special kind of magic that chnge wearer psychology and world perceiving. My prescription changed slowly and always eyetest was amazing and exciteing experience for me.My current prescription is -3.0R,-3.25L.I wear black squere metal frames with normal lenses.Most of time I use contact lenses.It is more comfortable and allows to live without limits. </p><p>I am also crazy about girls with glasses.I thing glasses makes them very sexy, sensual and intellectual look.In my oppinion glasses(wore by nice, preety woman) are deep source of erotic experience.I like watching other peolpe wear theirs gllasses and estimate prescriptions.My favorite kind of specs is metal frames with normal lenses at medium and high prescriptions.I would like to experience different degrees of myopia so GOC is one of my dreams. </p><p>At my first post I would like to dhare some interesting sighting I had last time.There is opti shop nera my house.Once I was standing at bus stop and I saw girl trying specs.I came closer and looked inside throught the window.I realized she had quite srong minus specs and she chose specs.She put her specs off, put on the table and put new frames on.Then she moved her face very close to the mirror and next...put her old specs on to new frames and watched herself for a distance.She did it few times and chose nice metal frames.Then the salesman showed her table with  profiles od different indexed lenses.When she came out I saw her specs in details.Big plastic oval frames with blueblocked lenses about -10,-12 dioptries.It looked so sexy on her small nose and delicate face...Sometimes I wish I was optican and I helped to choose specs for beautiful girls.Wouldn't it be great :)) </p><p>Hope to in touch time to time </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2002, 21:44</p><p>Frank&amp;Chunky;:- all my life I've been a romantic soulmate believer searching the crowd for my special lover who would be not only beautiful, affectionate and understanding, but also extremely nearsighted...(a rare combination). When I finally found her and saw her sweet smile and friendly eyes looking up at me through myodisc glasses I was totally blown away.  The first couple of times I talked to her at her workplace I remember going out to my pickup in the parking lot after and being literally UNABLE to drive because my knees were too weak to press down the clutch!  We were "together" for about 5 years and we are still good friends. I never had to ask her for "glasses play" because everything (Everyhing!) I wanted happened naturally in time. Did I tell her about my glasses fetish? In the interest of truth I wanted to but...No.  All her life she has struggled for acceptance and self-esteem(not only because of her vision) and I felt, rightly or wrongly, that she just didn't need to hear that I had been attracted to her at first,not because of her inherent sweetness, but because of something she considered her unattractive abnormality; her glasses.  I don't know.  Was I wrong? Comments welcome from anyone (especially any-female-one).   Frank and Chunky, do your respective partners know that you are posting here?  If so how do they feel about it?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Frank</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2002, 03:20</p><p>Chunky you are right - we have to learn the hard way - in the 1970s also I suggested twice (the first time she pretended not to hear me) to my myopic live-in lover, that she wear her glasses in bed. She still ignored the request but later, during a small tiff, she told me tearfully that I 'wanted her to be ugly' - I was young and not so facile with persuasion, plus a little embarrassed at my fetish and couldn't gainsay her attitude. </p><p>Having said that, we split up a few months later and she rebounded with some aplomb, marrying a tall Texan and settling in California,within a few months, according to her Mum who couldn't wait to tell me.... Do you want to swap any more stories,  I have quite a few - you can get me on eyelovegwg@hotmail.com  </p><p>- specially created when I found this yummy site. </p><p>A bientot </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chunky</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2002, 12:23</p><p>Frank. Yes my mate knows and as she loves being a GWG, it all turns her on, and it adds to the recipe. But life is not always so smooth. I recall in the 1970's I had a lover who hid behind her minus 5's,and boy, was she fit!!! I told her what it was about her that turned me on, and she was gravely insulted. Maybe I should have concentrated on her fit personage first, before adding the icing on the cake. There is no rule book to this, we all have to learn the hard(!) way. Cheers </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Frank</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2002, 11:32</p><p>Chunky - but have you told your lover how she turns you on?  That is a subject of much debate on this site and one that has had some unfortunate outcomes and some joyous. The next time I tell, and she keeps telling me her sight is getting worse, it will be personalised - as in ' you know it's a funny thing but I get really turned on by your glasses'. I don't think she will handle being in a long list. </p><p>Cheers</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>S-type</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2002, 14:56</p><p>A couple of years ago a TV show (something like but not candid camera) had a person (with good vision) pretend to have lost her glasses in the street and was asking passers-by for help. Most all who did stop did try to help her.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>S-type</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2002, 14:51</p><p>It may be a fetish or even funny to see a person with poor eyesight having lost his or her glasses and gropping for them helplessly. But everything aside, this is a human being with a handicap in need of help. If it was you, you certinally would want to be helped and would want to think someone was standing by watching for whatever reason. If someone fell out of a wheel chair you would help that person, I would like to believe. And if it just happens to be an attractive myopic lady in need of your help___what better chance of meeting is there?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chunky</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2002, 13:27</p><p>Frank. I live on the other side of the world to you, but your experiences with myopic women mirror mine. I too are in that part of life called middle age, and have had a craze for myopic females since about the age of 7. I suppose the craze became a fetish post puberty. Yes, the first time I made love to a myopic girl with glasses in the 1960's was sensational - turbocharged is perhaps the best word I can think of. Fast forward 30 years or so to today and I have a gorgeous woman friend who wears -7 glasses and all those intense feelings I had when I was in my 20's are still there. She just has to look at me through those strong lenses and she has me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Frank</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2002, 09:55</p><p>To Anonymous Coward  - yes - well within 90  minutes drive of Rotorua anyway. But don't be a coward. I am experiencing such joy since I found I was not alone. All the stories about GOC amaze me too. I have been turned on by glasses since eight years old or less. Was it my little brother getting glasses aged three, and more attention than I? Perhaps.  </p><p>I would love to share my whole story of lovers with glasses, the few rare, infrequent times when the GWGs have kept them on. Now I want to upgrade my pathetic prescription - and my optometrist is the cutest GWG of Asian extraction so what is holding me back? </p><p>Last year it was magic - her close to me in the dark, her breath on my face and just the hint of a clink of her fashiony frames on my cheek as she worked. I can't wait!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anonymous Coward</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2002, 22:10</p><p>Frank, are the caves you're talking about the Rotorua caves?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Frank</b>&nbsp;03 Sep 2002, 04:23</p><p>I like keeping this fetish thread going. I am a middle-aged man fascinated with GWG since I was seven . Imagine. Would that the strong black frames of the 1960s had never left us. The first girl I made love to with her glasses on (I have only recently got a light - Rx) was 1975 - in a boat in a glow-worm adorned grotto in New Zealand - where I was a cave guide. She was a tourist looking for a good time and I had picked her up at the resort's bar. Let's face it, she picked me and I was interested at once - her -5 lenses made sure of that. She was with a friend, both visitors from the USA, and a colleague of mine joined our table. Carole and I chatted and at one stage she took her glasses off. Her friend shot her a look 'you don't usually do that' it seemed to say. But I just purred. We talked about a trip through underneath the glowworms and walked back to my room, at the resort. She needed her glasses to see so they were back on her pretty nose and once inside my room she said "What shall we do now..?  F....?" </p><p>I just smiled. I was utterly turned on and wanted her to keep her glasses on but they came off as I lit the candles. Twenty minutes later we were panting exhausted and her glasses were back on. Instantly I was hard again and I can still remember her saying..."Take my glasses off.." as an initiation for more sex . Sure enough.. </p><p>Then we went for the midnight boat ride and deep in the grotto, with a thousand glow-worms looking down, were made love a third time. She lay on her back on one of the seats and kept her glasses on to relish the view. I relished the view of her, dimly lit but brightly bespectacled.  </p><p>Later she apologised for hogging the view of the glow-worms. I smiled. My happiness was complete. </p><p>I never saw her again - maybe she will read this. I have never forgotten my first spexual encounter. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;31 Aug 2002, 23:34</p><p>I seem to remember a story very like that being posted on EyeScene way, way back - maybe in the polls before the previous BBS.
