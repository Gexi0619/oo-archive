<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2018, 10:09</p><p>Nice to see Brooke Shields in spex but hope she's "gone full-time" may be premature.  On Getty's online photo site, there are a number of photos from the same event as the one posted. And Shields is wearing a tuxedo-type outfit, typically a man's outfit--and I wonder if the spex are just part of the fashion, well-dressed, highly tailored executive vibe, rather than an alteration of her day-to-day eyewear opting. </p><p>On a somewhat related (and sad) note, the death of designer Kate Spade has occasioned remembering her accessory lines and designs, and while glasses have not been specifically noted, a number of photos show her sporting spade eyewear. And she did offer a fashion option for those who chose to wear their glasses. Peace upon all who share her loss.   </p><p></p><hr>

Such a shame you can't go on the show as an existing couple as we both fancy Cici and Laura, but the whole point of the show is for 2 single people to meet for the first time at the restaurant! Even though the show is recorded in a real restaurant none of the waiting staff on the show really work there when they are not making the show, so no chance of seeing Cici or Laura.

<p><b>rafa</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2018, 09:12</p><p>On Netflix it's worth checking out the film "NEWNESS", starring Spanish actress Laia Costa, who in some scenes wears her prescription minus glasses, whose rx I estimate between -4 or -5.  She looks gorgeous in them. It's a pretty good film, actually.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Blind Without 'Em</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2018, 08:12</p><p>Brenda in Adventures in Babysitting, having her glasses stolen, wanders around the bus station blindly and mistakes a rat for a kitten. (The bag lady who steals them is actually able to see better with them; ironically, in Real Life she'd likely be even blinder trying to wear glasses not prescribed to her.) </p><p> </p><p>Adventures in Dinosaur City: Jamie has her glasses knocked off in a bar fight and is left to crawl around trying to find them. Subverted when one of her friends accidentally steps on them before she can find them; while she's clearly troubled by it, it's not a massive deal to her. </p><p> </p><p>Sheriff Albert Earp in Carry On Cowboy  although he is not really much better with them on. </p><p> </p><p>Delicatessen has a woman who removes her glasses in order to look better for a man she's about to see. She is almost completely blind without them and many times knocks something over or overpours tea. We are given a view of her vision a few times and she's pretty blind. </p><p> </p><p>The title character of Dr. Cyclops. He can't see at all without his coke-bottle spectacles; that's why he summoned the team of scientists to his island, because he needed to use a microscope to perfect his shrinking device, and couldn't use one while wearing them. His miniaturized victims try to take advantage of this by breaking them. They only manage to break one lens, but that blinds him enough for them to trick him into chasing them to a mineshaft, where he plummets to his death. </p><p> </p><p>A mall employee from Eight Legged Freaks, who proved himself Too Dumb to Live by repeatedly taking off his glasses, even when on the run from giant spiders. Eventually, he blindly walks up to one and is killed. </p><p> </p><p>Olivia in Final Destination 5 appears to be this. When she loses her glasses on the bridge she is unable to do anything but stumble around and cry for help. The audience is also shown a brief glimpse of her vision  it's pretty dire. </p><p> </p><p>Sinistra, the bikini-clad temptress in the '60s beach-party film The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini. </p><p> </p><p>Gattaca has Vincent lose his contacts and is thus utterly helpless when he tries to cross a main drag (which is plain dumb in the first place). </p><p> </p><p>The Goonies. Stef loses her glasses early on in the adventure. While she complains a few times about not being able to see, she doesn't seem to have much of a problem throughout the rest of the movie. </p><p> </p><p>Geek Charming: It is revealed halfway throughout the film that Dylan secretly wears contact lenses. However, she accidentally loses one of her contacts and is forced to wear her glasses to school. She tries to not wear them resulting in this trope. </p><p> </p><p>In Guest House Paradiso, Richie donned Eddie's glasses as a disguise. They were both rendered nearly blind as a result. </p><p> </p><p>The film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban averts this trope nicely when Harry gets his glasses knocked off by the Whomping Willow. This leads to a fuzzy but still somewhat intelligible P.O.V. Shot that's pretty close to what the world looks like through myopia. </p><p> </p><p>In How to Marry a Millionaire, Pola (Marilyn Monroe) is blind without her glasses, and vain enough to always take them off around men. This leads to scenes like pretending to read a book, which she's holding upside down. </p><p> </p><p>Averted in Jurassic Park. At one point, Dennis Nedry loses his glasses. He looks for them for about a second before saying "I can afford more glasses", being in a hurry to catch a ship. His sight is not drastically affected. However, not having his glasses leaves his eyes vulnerable to the spat venom of the Dilophosaurus. </p><p> </p><p>Major League: Pitcher Ricky Vaughn can't make out the strike zone until he's fitted with an embarrassing pair of glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Minority Report has a man say this to very creepy effect. He is standing over his bed (that he caught his wife with another man in) and as he puts his glasses on he's raising a pair of shears about to stab them. Thankfully Precrime foresaw this and arrived in time to stop him. </p><p> </p><p>Done very scarily in The Mummy (1999). When Mr. Burns' glasses get broken in the tunnel, he must feel his way in the dark. He sees the mummy ahead of him, but his eyesight is so bad he's not sure he sees anything. He looks away, then back, only to be sure that someone/something was there because it's now gone. The mummy appears right behind him, so now he can see the mummy up close. He can only scream before he gets his eyes and tongue ripped out. Which then means that the Mummy, having his eyes, is short-sighted. No wonder he later thinks the lead female is his lover. Word of God says this was the idea in the original script, although they never drew explicit attention to it. </p><p> </p><p>My Cousin Vinny: Subverted when the inept defense lawyer tries to discredit a witness by claiming the man couldn't have seen the perps' faces because he wasn't wearing his vital glasses. The witness replies that they're reading glasses. </p><p>Also subverted with another witness, who was wearing her glasses when she saw the crime. In this case, though, she's half-blind even with the glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Sorority Boys contains what is probably the stupidest example of this trope ever. It's a drag comedy that expects us to believe that a character without her glasses can't tell the difference between a naked man and a naked woman. </p><p> </p><p>The Spider-Man Trilogy. Pete before getting his powers, and when they start failing. </p><p> </p><p>Donald Sutherland's character in Space Cowboys says he only needs glasses for a few things, like "reading, driving, seeing movies, walking..." He nonetheless passes the NASA eyesight test by memorizing the letters: "I may be blind, but I have a perfect memory!" </p><p> </p><p>In a reversal, although not really a subversion, in Strangers on a Train, Alfred Hitchcock wanted the actress who played Miriam to wear glasses with thick lenses so he could show her murder reflected in them, and to make her resemble another character. The actress, Casey Rogers (billed as Laura Elliott), didn't need glasses, and couldn't see at all with the costume glasses on. She wears the thick lenses for close-up and medium scenes, and plain lenses for long shots, but there are still several scenes where she has to depend on other people to make sure she doesn't trip or stumble when she's wearing the glasses. In the scenes where Miriam goes to the amusement park with two men, she is holding both their arms most of the time because she can't see where she is going. </p><p> </p><p>Straw Dogs (2011): the male protagonist, although it's done poorly and not even referenced until his glasses are knocked off during the climax. </p><p> </p><p>Turkey Shoot has a particularly glaring example: Ritter removes one prisoners  </p><p>glasses before setting him out on the field. </p><p> </p><p>An important plot point in 12 Angry Men (and the play on which it was based, of course): Juror #9 recalls that a key witness in the murder case had marks on her nose suggesting that she usually wears glasses, though opted not to in court. He points out that she was unlikely to be wearing them in bed late at night when she claims to have seen the murder from all the way across the street, thereby making her less than credible as a witness. </p><p> </p><p>Black Comedy example in Wild Wild West. Artemis Gordon has a device that can project the last thing a murder victim saw before he died, but to do so, he has to mount the victim's decapitated head onto the device. Anyway, at first, the image is very blurry (they can see someone who's obviously General McGrath, but not a paper he's holding) until West notices the victim's glasses on the table and puts them over his eyes. Then they can see the document clearly.</p><p></p><hr>

I know the first time I ever saw her in anything was a TV series which I don't recall the name of. She played a sort of spy character. I remember some of the earlier episodes she sometimes went undercover in disguise which sometimes included her wearing glasses. I of course loved those episodes. But then in later episodes she was also wearing glasses whole in the office and planning how to handle the new case they were working on.Most likely her glasses were real and in her prescription. I hated to see thta show go off air.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2017, 16:57</p><p>Hayley Atwell is probably most famous in the U.S. for playing Agent Carter in the Marvel movies and TV shows. She originally appeared as Captain America's love interest in his first movie, then later got a spinoff series dedicated to her character. </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3475734/" target="_blank">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3475734/</a> </p><p> </p><p>Yes, a very attractive woman!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Badeyes</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2017, 14:19</p><p>The BBC weather girI Kate kinsella complained that people said she was too plump, too busty or too short-sighted! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2017, 13:57</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Thanks for the info on Hayley. Of course being in the US we don't get the same shows as you get on the BBC network including "Howard's End". </p><p>I will be watching for her ot show up on one of our network shows. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2017, 12:33</p><p>Hayley Atwell is half English and half American and is currently one of the main characters, Margaret Schlegal, in the BBC period drama series "Howards End" (Gemma and I love a good Sunday evening BBC tv drama.) I wasn't that aware of her until now although her name did sound vaguely familiar. I didn't know she wore glasses until I Googled her. The 3rd photo is from her Instagram page and is dated October 2016. </p><p>Apparently, when she was in a film or a tv series a few years ago the director told her she was fat! Looking through loads of photos of her taken over the years she has been acting she is not fat in any of them! She has got quite a big bust but not a big belly. Rude man!  </p><p>She doesn't wear glasses in Howards End, so I presume she wears contacts or doesn't need glasses full time. The drama is set in early 20th century England which obviously means she couldn't wear her own modern glasses as they would look far too modern.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2017, 10:02</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I don't know who Hayley Atwell is but she is attractive for sure. As best as I can tell her glasses appear to be a very weak minus prescription which usually means she may have only recently been prescribed glasses. Have you seen wearing glasses for a while or only recently? </p><p></p><hr>

Very surprising to see her playing with real prescription glasses, I'd say -2 or -3. Very nice views of the rings and of the scenes minified by her glasses. I think they were her eeal glasses at that time, otherwise she woud have used plano glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2017, 06:18</p><p>Pseldonymov (Sept 5th), </p><p> </p><p>Apologies for the long delay. Anna's photo shoot is on my previous weblog:  </p><p> </p><p>lovelyladiesbehindcrystalveil.blogspot.com/ </p><p> </p><p>There are 120 photos of her, most of them in front of a large mirror in a trendy boutique. She was one of five models who posed for me in Paris, January last year (see index on top page). Unfortunately Blogger has changed something, maximizing the column on the right to 100 photos. The best way to get access to Anna's photos is to click the year 2016, then the month (either February or more likely, March) and then scroll down the page and click "oudere berichten"). You may have to repeat this procedure 20 or 30 times to reach Anna's photos. But don't worry, they are there.  </p><p> </p><p>Best of luck!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2017, 08:17</p><p>It appears that Kelly Ripa may be moving towards full time wear.  On her morning talk show, her glasses used to be on the desk.  She and Ryan would walk on stage and sit at the desk.  She would only put her specs on when she had sometime to read.  But this week she has been wearing them walking onto stage and wearing them much more.  She still takes them off when interviewing other celebs since she it typically not reading anything then.</p><p></p><hr>

Bobbi Riggs was a bit of a nut case but this became a major TV event back then and had to be a huge boost to tennis and even more so women's tennis.  </p><p>I watched the trailer and without a doubt the aviator glasses she wears has a a decent cut-in which you can clearly in her right lens of her glasses at the 00:56 point and in her left lenses at 1:36. The round glasses i couldn't get a good enough look at to determine if they also were prescription but my guess all of the glasses she wears has her actual prescription. i have a feeling since this happened so long ago and I don't know how many people even know who Billy Jean King  is or Bobbi Riggs it won't stay on the big screen very long an be available on DVD rather quickly.  </p><p>You're right it is nice to see more and more TV shows and movies with the main actresses wearing their own prescription in glasses.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jan</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2017, 07:16</p><p>First Kill seems good too. Maybe the producers finally get the point that real glasses obviously add big time to the realism of the whole film. I started to give up hope. But there it is...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;12 May 2017, 03:23</p><p>Watching Kelly Ripa, she is wearing her glasses for all but the first few moments of her daily morning show. Eagle-eyed observers will note that these are a new style of frames. Previously she'd worn (for reading only) a pair of black (or very dark) frames.  The current pair is darker on the top of the frames then "fading" to lighter or clear at the bottom. They glasses also look to be a much better fit on her face and so are also more attractive--like she's wearing her glasses rather than just a pair of glasses. </p><p>On a recent show (wedn, 5/10?), they also did a spot about the "latest eyewear styles" tho there was not a lot of info and Kelly tried on only two other frame styles, a clear round and a wire round frame.  Both looked ok but the ones she's now wearing are more attractive.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2017, 20:14</p><p>Soundmanpt, Jamie Alexander is the main character on the "The Blind Spot" </p><p>on NBC here in the States. She doesn't wear glasses on the show. Hayden was on the Harry show last month where he commented her on her glasses, she remarked about her eyesight &amp; age thing. She appeared to be pleased with her eyesight &amp; eyewear. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2017, 12:25</p><p>Spexmann </p><p>Thanks for posting the pictures of Hayden and Jamie. I know you went to a lot of trouble getting them up. Jamie Alexander is a very attractive woman and I have seen her before in shows but any idea what she might be in now or was in recently? When I enlarged her pictures in 2 of them you got a really nice close up of her and I wasn't able to determine what her glasses might be for. It appears that her glasses are extremely weak. Hayden of course has been seen quite often wearing glasses and she must really like this pair because this is about the 4th time she has been pictured wearing the same glasses. She made it clear on one of t daytime talk shows that she is nearsighted when she commented that she was able to see the people in the back of the audience because she wore her glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2017, 09:22</p><p>Well how strange is this. Just the other night it was Emma Roberts trying on Stephan Colbert's glasses. Last night one of his guests was Marisa Tomei and Mr. Colbert what it would be like to turn one of lady Gaga's song lyrics into a scene from a Broadway play. He pulled on 2 cards with the lyrics written for each of them to read. And then he asked her if she needed her glasses? She said yes and for some reason he had her glasses even in the case. He opened it and handed her glasses to her. She put on but she seemed to have a bit of a problem trying to find the right distance that she was able to read her part from. Her glasses were on the bigger side and several times the way she moved I could see that her glasses had the tell tale line that lined bifocals have. I think she may have already been wearing contacts and that caused her a bit of a problem with trying to read with her glasses. Just interesting that he had 2 female guests that both involved glasses. I'm sure if someone looks there must be pictures from the show.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2017, 10:02</p><p>oopsl </p><p>I saw that clip of Emma Roberts on Stephan Colbert's late night show. I can't believe that she really thought his glasses were only for fashion. She seems to have a "thing" about glasses but she clearly doesn't have any idea about prescriptions. When she put his glasses on she even asked if her eyes looked bigger. Colbert even told her before that that he needs his glasses to see the monitor. So his glasses if anything would have made her eyes appear smaller not bigger. But she did look quite nice with his glasses on and of course they were too strong for her eyes. Interesting that she said that she thinks she needs glasses glasses for reading but she isn't sure because maybe it's just because she wants them. Funny she is a well known star with lots of time on her hands wouldn't you think she would take the time to get her eyes checked?  </p><p>I was watching ET last night and they were interviewing Candace Cameron Bure know from "Full House" and her 18 year old daughter Natasha Bure. Natasha was on the Voice and was even selected. But she is already an author with a published book to her name. But it was nice to see her wearing glasses. Her glasses were the bigger style glasses like most young ladies are wearing. Very pretty young lady and easy to tell that she has a lot of self confidence. She apparently doesn't have a boyfriend, by her own choice and she says the only purpose of dating is to find a husband. So she must know exactly what she is looking for in a man. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2017, 11:39</p><p>Carrie </p><p>You posted a set of pictures of Kristen having breakfast with a friend back on "29 Sept 2016  05:16" Quite a few of the pictures if you enlarge them you can clearly see that the glasses she is wearing have noticeable magnification. Also notice the dark circles under her eyes. That is often caused by wearing glasses very often and she doesn't seem to mind wearing glasses so she likely didn't bother doing any makeup and she is dressed very casual so glasses was faster and easier for her. Remember she has been seen many times wearing glasses. Most likely when she isn't on screen she prefers to wear glasses rather than contacts. Don't you get the idea that even though she can glam up when necessary she would rather go casual most often including wearing her glasses. So i seriously think the glasses she is wearing in those pictures "Tiff" posted are her prescription glasses and not "plano".  </p><p>I was wondering where you have been since I haven't seen any posts from you recently.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2017, 11:28</p><p>Nicola </p><p>Thanks for posting the 2 sets of pictures of the very lovely Kate Beckinsale. I wasn't aware that she had lasik. I do recall seeing pictures of her several years ago wearing glasses so she could see the teleprompter. Is there a reason to assume that her glasses are readers other than the fact that it is common for people to need readers much sooner after having lasik. But some also not uncommon for many to become myopic again as well. I think in both sets she appears to have just left a building. So in going outside she likely had only just taken her glasses off so she could wear sunglasses while walking to her car. And because she needs her glasses to see to drive again she didn't bother putting them in her bag. Her sunglasses appear to be non prescription sos once in her car she will put her prescription glasses on again to drive home or where ever she she might be headed.  </p><p>I know of a several people that had lasik and after a few years with perfect or even better than perfect eyesight needed to start wearing a weak minus prescription again. Two of them were opticians that I know. They both have glasses that are only around -1.00 with no further change in their vision.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2017, 10:43</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Have you noticed that one of your favorite actresses has cut her hair to bald? I saw Kristen Stewart on a late night talk show and it must only 1/2" long and the little hair she has is blonde. Just curious what you think about her new look? Personally i don't like that look at all.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2017, 10:19</p><p>DRE </p><p>Thanks for posting the pictures of Ariel Winter. Very interesting because about 6 or 7 months ago I read an article about her. And she got role on Modern Family they decided that she should wear glasses and be somewhat of a nerd on the show and she said at the time she had perfect eyesight and that her eyesight was still perfect. So even though her character is never without her glasses on the show she was never before seen off camera wearing glasses until now. So it's possible that her glasses are fake but odd that she would now start wearing fake glasses when she was never seen wearing glasses off camera before. My guess is that she recently was prescribed glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2017, 10:46</p><p>On Friday while I was eating lunch I had the TV on and I in reviewing what shows were on I noticed that Hayden Panettiere was going to be a guest on Th e Talk TV show. And since I find her be a very attractive young lady I decided to watch. What a pleasant surprise when they announced her and she came out wearing glasses. She had her hair pulled back and she hardly got seated when one of the panel of women said that she looked like a hot librarian. Hayden smiled and replied that her glasses were "very real and that it was nice to be able to see the people in the audience" That was all that was made of wearing glasses. But she of course did look hot wearing her Ray-Ban style glasses.  </p><p>Then while googling her to see how to spell her last name I noticed several more pictures of her wearing glasses and the pictures in The Daily Mail she is wearing the same glasses as she was wearing on the show and in one picture she must have taken her glasses off for the  picture because she is holding her glasses in her hand. But she also has them on in one as well.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2017, 11:02</p><p>FaNaTiKX </p><p>Thanks for posting those pictures of Mandy Moore. You're right it has been a long while since we last saw her wearing glasses. But then again she really had been out of the limelight for a few years. I always thought she was quite attractive and talented both with singing and acting. So i'm happy for her to be in a hit show "This is Us" Funny thing when I heard she going to be in it I watched hoping maybe her character might wear glasses but it wasn't to be, so far anyway.  </p><p>Anyway not surprising tha she looks really good wearing glasses. I like that her glasses are on the simple side but still fashionable. I enlarged each picture trying to determine what her prescription might be but her glasses must still be on the weak side because I couldn't see any cut-in and I   assume she is probably nearsighted. </p><p></p><hr>

But if she is going to be wearing glasses more often then I think I need to change. Was she wearing glasses as part of a disguise or was she wearing them as if she needed them? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2017, 21:09</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for the information about Jordana Brewster.  It sounds like she has late onset myopia.  She is quite attractive with her glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Megan Boone's glasses appeared to be real on last night's episode of Blacklist.  There were a few shot where she turned her head and the viewers were given a view of her glasses from the back.  There was minification.  I wish that she would wear glasses more often on the show.  She looked good.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2017, 11:16</p><p>I googled "Jordana Brewster wearing glasses" and I found a tweet where she tweeted that she had got her first prescription for glasses and she was so excited. back on July 31st 2012. This might explain why she is often pictured wearing glasses. She apparently was quite happy about needing glasses. Also she has had at least one child since she got her first glasses and maybe two so that could have increased her prescription slightly as well. Sorry I missed both those shows with her wearing glasses. I did she a picture from "Leathal Weapon of her wearing glasses and they appear to be the same glasses she has on in some of the pictures of her out around LA. So she most likely was just wearing her own glasses in that show at least. Again it's so nice to see that more and more stars are starting to be seen in all sorts of shows wearing glasses now. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;13 Dec 2016, 02:34</p><p>Soundman - I've registered on several sites, two of which have mobile apps and despite both the mobile apps having numerous photos on the profile - one has 5, the other has 7, I've found that the majority of the girls on there aren't glasses wearers. I had thought the same thing as you - they think they're more attractive without glasses - so had swiped through an image or two more of the girls I thought were attractive, but probably only 1 to 3% of the women on there have 1 photo of them in glasses out of the 5-7 photos! More often than not, the glasses also like the dreaded planos!! I've had two "matches" so far and messaged them so we'll have to see how we go although from friends comments, and looking online it says the majority of people don't respond to every match/message </p><p> </p><p>The Spex Dating app that was linked here previously is utterly useless as they literally have only about 5 women on there even when conducting a broad search, and one of them is the founder of the site who isn't single and merely shows her bio!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Dec 2016, 10:13</p><p>gwgs </p><p>There is a free dating site that I have checked into and you're right. you see very few young ladies wearing glasses for their main picture. But the site I was in often allowed for several pictures and their you would often see that same woman wearing her glasses. It is only a guess but I suspect that there maybe several reasons why women aren't seen wearing glasses their. One reason is that even though glasses have become much more popular and women are wearing glasses more often many of them still probably feel they are more attractive and thus more appealing to the opposite sex if they aren't wearing glasses. Plus I have seen a good number of young ladies that even though they wear their glasses full time will take their glasses off if they are getting their picture taken. It could be because they figure their eyes can't be seen as well with their glasses on or maybe just a habit they still have.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;12 Dec 2016, 02:20</p><p>This is true, Soundman and Chris, and whilst we have definitely seen a huge rise in women feeling they are now more socially able to wear glasses instead of contacts / going bare eyed, and wearing their glasses on a day to day basis, I have been surprised by the LACK of girls with glasses on the regular datings apps / websites. When you put in your search perameters and are shown the results, there is probably only 1 out of 30 women that is seeing wearing glasses, and they won't have that as their primary photo. I'm also yet to see someone with strong glasses on any dating app - which on a day to day basis you are likely to encounter 2 or 3 times in a busy city like London. </p><p> </p><p>There must therefore still be some sort of hang up /pre-conception that glasses still aren't as 'cool' as they should be and for 0-0 lovers this is a real disappointment and disappointing to see that despite the leaps and bounds we've made in glasses being more acceptable, they're still not thought of as something that should be featured on profile pics for dating. OR, it could be all of the girls with glasses in the world aren't single!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2016, 16:39</p><p>chrisb </p><p>I think what you have been observing is becoming more and more common now. There is almost certainly a link between people's use of I-Phones and the many other devices with small print on the eyes. Before these things were available even when someone may have needed glasses they were able to get by since their eyes were never exposed to so much small print. And at that same time in history wearing glasses for women wasn't at all a popular thing. So really it seems that all these things just came together at the exact same time. The I-Phone came out, texting became the new way to communicate, people were drawn more and more to these devices and for many trying to see so much small print simply took its toll on their eyes. Now glasses were more than just an option but rather a necessity in order to read all those text messages. Along with more and more people now requiring glasses the glasses companies started providing many more options of frame styles. Glasses now had become fashionable and more accepted as being a normal part of life. Anyway that's the way I see it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>chrisb</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2016, 14:08</p><p>We can but hope that Emma Ishta's chain sets a trend. It's not often acknowledged but there has been a massive increase in the number of young GWG's.  I've remarked before that I believe this and the other Glasses sites we know and love have contributed to this effect. </p><p> </p><p>In my daily journey across the trendy parts of North London I am always amazed by the ratio of GWG vs non GWG among 20-30 year olds (and younger)  Perhaps  the pervasive  smart phone has also contributed.  Many seem to have such a low rx and before today's fashion tastes would gone without. </p><p> </p><p>It's also not unusual to see the part time, or perhaps ambivalent wearer with her glasses stuck in her hair. </p><p> </p><p>Of course in the media, glasses on a chain are the antithesis of cool and present a very negative impression. </p><p> </p><p>But lets hope Emma's quite logical mode of glasses / not glasses wearing is going to overturn those negative associations.  Come on masters of digital media manipulation, set to work.  Let Emma Ishtar be your poster (sic) girl.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2016, 15:03</p><p>What I think is interesting is that you mostly only ever saw people that needed reading glasses use those type of chains on their glasses. Her glasses are clearly for distance which is easy to tell through her left lens by viewing the words in the background. But I guess it is just her way of having her glasses handy when she needs them rather than just wearing them all the time. By the way I really love her glasses. They appear to be from a company called Artcraft if memory serves me right and I know they are still in business and making the same type of glasses that they made back in the 1940's. I actually have pair just like the ones she is wearing. But mine are actually gold filled and the lenses are glass and the nose pads are made from real ivory.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

It looks like she "broke down" and admitted her need on the show Friday, Nov 4, and now wears them when she needs to read, often during the "host chat" portion at the beginning of the show, when current celebrity and other "soft" news is discussed. Towards the end of the one hour daily show there is an "Inbox" segment when messages from viewers are read, and here again, the spex come out.  </p><p>Video is available on the show's website, but have not found any caps.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2016, 09:22</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Just looking at the video loop you posted of the lovely Chloe Moretz and her glasses very clearly have plus lenses. But what I found of interest is that the magnification is noticeable through her left lens near the bottom. But I don't notice see any magnification on the upper part of her lens. So I wonder if she might be wearing progressives or as you call them over their varifocals? Without a doubt she has more than enough money to have her glasses made with either a very weak minus in the distance areas or no prescription at all for distance and a reading add in the lower segment By doing that she can wear her glasses as much as she wishes without having any effect on her being able to see distances perfectly.  </p><p></p><hr>

What the strange thing is is that she is reading from a piece of paper and acting totally au fait as if these are her real glasses and she is high myope but then in the blink of an eye, she takes them off, puts them on the desk and walks over to the Bond girl continues talking to her and operating perfectly normally without them!  </p><p>Is she a high myope or not as either way, with or without she did a remarkable act of wearing / not wearing them.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2016, 11:06</p><p>Last night Nichol won the $500,000.00 prize money on Big Brother. For anyone that hasn't seen the show Nichol is a very attractive blonde that wears glasses full time with a decent prescription. The only time she didn't have her glasses on was for some of the challenges that they had to do and it would have been dangerous for her to be wearing glasses. At the end of the show last night her family came up to congratulate her and not surprising all her family members were wearing glasses. It looked like her dad, mother and sister as best as I could tell. </p><p></p><hr>

They look to be rather weak so its possible they are even her first glasses.  </p><p>I have seen her in "Braindead" but it is really a very strange show. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Willy</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2016, 18:33</p><p>As wondrous a vision as a legitimately bespectacled Karen Gillan would be, after some investigation, i have to throw a small amount of cold water on the assertion that the glasses in the picture linked below are hers. </p><p> </p><p>The picture posted on the KG Perfect Hair Tumblr account has a date stamp of September 29, 2013, whereas the KG tweets about possibly needing glasses --- met with resounding approval -- were over a year later, in November 2014.  One of the replies to one of those tweets gave me the impression that KG may have been wearing a fan's glasses in 2013 so the fan could take a picture of her in them -- weirder things have happened in the scifi/fantasy cosplay world.  Also note that KG's head is still mostly shaved in the picture, which would make sense in September 2013 but not November 2014, after GOTG came out. </p><p> </p><p>Finally, given that KG is a fairly active tweeter and free sharer, one might imagine that if she had followed through with an eye test and gotten glasses, she would have tweeted about it later, but her feed never mentions the subject again. </p><p> </p><p>So at present, I'll have to say i think that KG's glasses status is not yet -- but soon?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2016, 16:35</p><p>No name  </p><p>Yeah it has been years since I saw that movie and as you say I had more than just that wrong as well including about her changing from contacts to glasses. That's why i'm impressed that Maria was able to even find the movie considering how much I was way wrong about. When you're right you're right so what can I say? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2016, 12:03</p><p>this is the scene where the "gun battle" takes place and she loses her glasses.  And where you say someone comes to help her. </p><p> </p><p>Not even close.  She is being hit by a police baton during a school protest, and she loses her glasses.  No one comes to help her.  She runs into the arms of blurry police officers and is arrested. </p><p> </p><p>it "sounds" like you mixed your fantasies and reality into your memory of this film. </p><p> </p><p>https://youtu.be/q0poPtpqsgc?t=1h26m</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2016, 18:20</p><p>Maria </p><p>First of all thank you so much for finding that. It couldn't have been very easy to find because I was even incorrect about how she met up with what turned out to be her bf. As soon as i saw thew name of the movie as being "Katherine" it instantly rang a bell for me that you had found the movie I was referring to. You must have watched some or most of it to even find the part I had so wrong where she had to remove one of her contacts and he convinced her to put on her glasses. Clearly the glasses were really not that attractive but at that time that was what many were wearing. I will be making a nice big bowl of popcorn and fixing a big glass of diet soda and sit back and watch that before I go to bed in about an hour. You really made my day by finding that. Kind of a dark sad movie with a not so great ending, but because of the glasses part a very interesting movie considering that when that movie was made hardly any movie ever had a leading lady wearing glasses. Again thank you. That was very nice of you to take time to find that for me. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>María</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2016, 13:51</p><p>Hi Soundmanpt! </p><p> </p><p>As you are so nice to me, I wanted to help, so I made a google search using the data you provided, and I believe the movie you're talking about is this one, Katherine, from 1975, starring Sissy Spacek. </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073229/" target="_blank">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073229/</a> </p><p> </p><p>The entire movie is in Youtube: </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0poPtpqsgc" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0poPtpqsgc</a> </p><p> </p><p>The glasses scene you are referring to is located at the 35:30 mark.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2016, 11:51</p><p>Not sure exactly where to post my question but this thread seems the closest.  </p><p>Anyway maybe 10 years ago or so I saw a movie on TV and in fact I saw a couple of times, but I have no idea what the name of it was. Anyway it was based on Vietnam protesters mostly protesting at colleges and things. The female lead was a very attractive young college girl and as best I can recall she was sitting on a bench outside and young man she didn't know approached and started chatting with her. After a bit she started having problems with one of her contact lenses and the guy told her that if she had her glasses with her she should just put them on. She did have her glasses and changed to them. The guy told her how nice she looked wearing glasses and that she should just stop messing with contacts and wear glasses. She quickly seemed to like the guy and she took his advice and proceeded to wear her glasses from then on. He was with a protest group and she soon joined the group and he seemed to be the leader of the group She soon was taking part in not only protests but doing several violent things as well where guns even came into play. Thye were even up against soldiers and during the course of time she even changed her glasses to a round wire rim glasses. At one point she in a gun battle her glasses somehow come off and she well enough to find them and her bf has to come and rescue her. I think in the end they both get killed but not sure. Does anybody know what movie I am describing? I would love to know and even better if they could post an attachment to view the movie. Thanks to all in advance. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2016, 15:58</p><p>Soundmanpt- Thanks for asking after me, very sweet of you, and thanks for mentioning the beautiful Kristen Stewart. I have noticed that Kristen likes to change her image now and again. She hasn't been seen wearing glasses for a while. I have a feeling they were very low or even no prescription and she has decided not to wear them any more. </p><p>I haven't been anywhere, I have been reading Eyescene just not posting anything. I felt I had been posting rather a lot and also I have been spending more time with friends and my beautiful girlfriend as summer is making repeated attempts to get started here in the UK. I could have posted but I was probably too tired or not alone. I'm struggling a bit now as it's quite late. I'll try and post something before the weekend.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2016, 08:02</p><p>rafa </p><p>I remember reading many years ago during the filming of a movie with John Travolavta that during one scene she fell off of the back of a wagon being pulled by a horse and hit her head and she hit her head. As a result her eyesight was effected and and she was seen wearing glasses from then on off screen. Sorry I don't recall the name of the movie just that it was a big hit. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2016, 07:46</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I happened to catch The Late Show with Jimmy Fallon last night and his main guest was one of your favorite women. Kristen Stewart and I am not nearly as big of a fan of her only because she sometimes over does it with too much makeup that looks like pate on her face at times. There has been several pictures of her where she is either wearing hardly any makeup maybe even none at all and she looks so much better. The only thing I did notice was slightly dark circles under her eyes most often seen when someone wears glasses full time.I think based on what we have seen in here that she seems to wear glasses quite a good bit when she is off camera and out and about.  </p><p>Anyway this may shock you but her hair is now mostly blonde. I say mostly because she has left a good portion of the roots black and even had her hair pulled to one side to further show the dark hair even more. She had an average top on with a light jacket and she had on the shortest shorts I have ever seen. In fact jimmy decided that they should lay "Twister" for drinks She must have known that by making any strange moves which often happen in twister her butt would be exposed so she took off her jacket and wrapped it around her waist to to cover her rear end. Jimmy then took off his jacket and proceeded to cover up his front side.  </p><p>Where have you been. Not seen anything from you for ages.  </p><p></p><hr>

She's not perfect without makeup but most women aren't, but she is still quite attractive. This is best shown in the 3rd picture down in your post of her on July 4th 2016  15:44.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2016, 08:37</p><p>Newshound </p><p>Funny thing I never watch that show but when I turned my TV on before I had a chance to change the station I noticed a rather attractive woman wearing glasses so I kept it on. To be honest I wasn't sure exactly who she was and even seeing her name didn't mean anything to me. I was wondering what show or movie she might have been in and yes I do remember Melrose Place. Yes for her prescription to appear as weak as it did I was surprised she would want to be seen on TV wearing glasses, but maybe she feels more comfortable wearing her glasses so he left them on. Just nice to see that so many women are leaving their glasses on more often now.  </p><p>The new seaon of "Big Brother" just started up and nice to see several of the young ladies in their wearing glasses. The best one of them all is Nichol for last season. She is an ER nurse and her glasses show quite a bit of cut-in. She wore glasses last year as well but she has new gone now. She has her glasses on full tiem except when she is doing a challenge. They so far have never shown her changing from glasses to contacts but there is very little doubt that she wouldn't be able to compete without either glasses or contacts. The challenges they do usually wouldn't be safe to be wearing glasses. But it really appears that Nichol must really prefer wearing her glasses because as soon as a challenge is over she is back wearing her glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lensed up</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2016, 09:59</p><p>From viewing the photos, I would say Scarlett Johansson wear a script of about +2 with some astigmatic correction.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lensed up</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2016, 09:54</p><p>Carrie, you may want to check out another of Woody's films called 'Interiors'. It's a dramatic film about three sisters, one of whom wears her real eyeglasses in the movie. Actress Mary Beth Hurt wears rimless frames holding minus lenses of about -5.0 D throughout the film.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2016, 10:54</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Yes I agree that was the reason I bought the movie because those glasses looked so good on her. But I assume she must feel as if they aren't her style, but who knows? Anyway I thought I heard something about a new movie either out or about to come out that was written and directed by Woody Allen and i googled it and sure enough there is a ne movie coming out. It is called "Cafe Society" and it stars a number of people including Steve carell and Sheryl Lee. It is set in the 30's and i did watch a trailer but didn't see any females wearing glasses except for sunglasses from that time frame.  </p><p>You may recall one of his more famous movies was "Annie Hall" which starred a very young Diane Keaton and she pretty much wore glasses throughout the movie. They were even romantically involved for several years. Ever since that movie Miss Keaton is hardly ever seen without glasses. And she wears glasses in nearly if not all of the movies she has been in since as well. Makes me wonder what influence he may have had in convincing her to wear glasses back when they were together?  </p><p>Alfred Hitchcock was also a producer/director that often featured his leading ladies wearing glasses. You may recall that in one of his biggest movies "Stranger on the Train" more than one young lady was wearing glasses. One star that was murdered even wore very real, very strong glasses for her role. She had perfect eyesight and the glasses wer so strong that she had to hold on to things just to shoot the scenes because she couldn't see anything with the glasses. I believe he even had his own daughter in the movie as well and she was also wearing glasses throughout.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2016, 09:59</p><p>Lensed up - those glasses are different to the ones I was thinking of. Nice find! </p><p>Soundmanpt - It's a pity she never wore those glasses in public if they did have her prescription in them. Maybe she wasn't too keen on them. Is Woody Allen making a movie at the moment? It would be great if he has another beautiful leading lady in glasses! If he has this fondness for women in glasses it would be amazing if he visits Eyescene. Maybe he does and he's a lurker! Hello Mr Allen!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2016, 07:00</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I'm not so sure that the glasses Scarlett Johansson wore in the movie "Scoop" were fake. I bought a copy of that movie and in doing a lot of slow motion and freeze framing it sure appeared that her had a prescription. Remember that movie was produced by Woody Allen and he always seemed to have his leading ladies wearing glasses on screen. The cost of fitting an actress with glasses in her own prescription was a small cost in the making of a movie. It was during the filming of this movie that Woody gifted her with a pair of his old glasses which she was thrilled to receive and she claimed that she even wore them with his prescription lenses in them until she got around to having her own prescription put into them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2016, 14:07</p><p>Lenses up - she certainly is incredibly beautiful and also a very good actress. Even though she wears glasses in real life occasionally I think the glasses she wore in Scoop are fake. In my opinion those frames suit her rather well as the delicate wire frames go well with her features. Her own glasses that I've seen her wearing are heavy thick black plastic ones. She has also worn thinner dark frames. She looks good in both dark frames but I would still prefer to see her in the round wire frames.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2016, 09:51</p><p>Soundmanpt - If you search on Google for "Jennifer Lawrence glasses" you will see several photos of Jennifer with a headscarf on and wearing large dark framed glasses. There is also a couple of pics of her when she was much younger visiting a haunted house tourist attraction wearing smaller rectangular frames. Unfortunately I can't work out what sort of prescription she has. It doesn't look particularly strong but then if she has a prescription like my friend at work with astigmatism and prisms it won't look particularly strong but makes a big difference to the wearer. </p><p>I think she's brilliant - a talented and beautiful actress who isn't afraid of causing a stir when it comes to things that mean a lot to her, like equal pay for actresses compared to actors.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2016, 08:44</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I wish I could prove you wrong about Melissa Benoit as well, but the only thing I have ever read and saw was a picture of her on the set but in her own street clothes still wearing glasses well after the shooting was done and the comment then was suggesting that she probably wouldn't still have the glasses on if she didn't need them. At times during the show her glasses appear to have some minification, but it could just be the angle you see through the glasses.  </p><p>No surprise that the lovely Jennifer Lawrence wears glasses. In fact I wouldn't at all be surprised if she wears plus glasses and or contacts. That might explain why the girl has stumbled going up on stage so many times. If you think about it it makes sense she might be wearing plus lenses so she can read her acceptance speech. But if she isn't used to them steps are going to look much closer to her than they really are causing a misstep. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2016, 09:40</p><p>eyesnap </p><p>Thanks for posting the information about Danica McKellar wearing glasses in the movie "Hack". I will have to make a point to find it at my local video store. I just hope it is still available? I have always thought that she wasn't the most beautiful actress I had ever seen, but there was something about her big bulging eyes that held my interest. It seems to me that read somewhere that she is some sort of genius in math I believe? She has even written books and such about it. So it would not at all be surprising that she wears glasses in real life. She even called herself a nerd once.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2016, 15:39</p><p>Jan Brady </p><p>I remember watching that episode when it first aired. I was in love with Marsha like every other boy in the world at the time but it was till nice seeing Jan get glasses. She actually worse them as I recall in several episodes later on but then she never appeared wearing them again. I wonder if she she maybe did need glasses and so the idea of writing them into the script came about. Then they decided that she shouldn't wear glasses on air and had her stop wearing them? It was a very pleasant surprise a few years ago to see Marsha on several TV shows wearing glasses. She still looks very attractive and it made me wonder when she might have gotten her first glasses. It appeared that she likely wears her glasses full time theses days.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2016, 15:31</p><p>Carrie </p><p>In looking at her glasses through her left lens which is really the only one you can really see completely through her glasses don't really appear to be all that strong. Yes there is some expected magnification but not all that much. My best guess is around +3.50 or +3.75, but you're probably right in saying that she probably needs to be wearing her glasses full time if she can't see any better than what she was claiming. It's possible that she does wear her glasses full time and she only took them off because she is a celebrity and most people recognize her best without glasses.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2016, 11:08</p><p>Amber Tamblyn's sight must be slightly worse than mine if the man in the audience looked a little fuzzy without her glasses. Possibly worse than my cousin's sight (hers is a little worse than mine). We both need our glasses full time so Amber probably should be wearing hers full time. Maybe she doesn't mind everything being a little fuzzy but it's too fuzzy to read so she has to wear her glasses for that. Without my glasses everything is just slightly out of focus but, like Amber, I can't read without my glasses. </p><p>Anyone like to suggest what Amber's prescription could be?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KL</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2016, 14:54</p><p>Re: link below to Amber Tamblyn reading poetry - the best part comes around 31 minutes, after she's finished reading and has taken her glasses off. She's talking to a guy in the audience, commenting "Though my glasses are off now, and you're looking a little fuzzy", followed shortly thereafter by "I can't see shhhh...ot."</p><p></p><hr>

Starlette was in episode 1 according to a german website and the woman in episode 5 is more of bangladashi or indian descent, I guess. Only thing i know is that she is called Dr. Meers, because I saw the episode with subtitles. </p><p> </p><p>Other ideas? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2016, 02:38</p><p>Jan, after Googling her and then looking through the cast list on IMDB, I think she may be Starlette Miariaunii as this actress is listed as being uncredited in one episode of this series - that ties in with what you say - but she appears to be more of a musician/drummer than actress despite being signed to an acting agency. </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3649055/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm" target="_blank">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3649055/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm</a> </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://putlocker.is/watch-the-magicians-tvshow-season-1-episode-5-online-free-putlocker.html" target="_blank">http://putlocker.is/watch-the-magicians-tvshow-season-1-episode-5-online-free-putlocker.html</a> </p><p> </p><p>I haven't been able to find any photos of her wearing glasses online, and both her social media accounts are set to private - boring :(</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2016, 02:05</p><p>Jan - great spot, I found a link to the trailer for this episode on YouTube, but all the links that state they offer the full episode for free then lead to a website asking for your bank card details! Can you find an online link to it?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2016, 12:39</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Yes George is right. I happened to see that Jimmy Fallon Show where she was guest and like he always does with his guests he usually has them do some sort of a challenge. This one sh needed to be able to see a prompter for the clue and she was struggling so badly that Jimmy could see her squinting and leaning as far out of her seat as she could go trying hard to see and he finally had to read it to her. I assume she didn't know ahead of time that she was going to be forced to see something a bit away from her or she might have at least had her glasses with her. I don't think she is too vain to be seen wearing them in public. It certainly looked far worse seeing her straining so hard and and unable to see. I don't even really like her but I even felt bad for her. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>George1968</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2016, 12:24</p><p>Carrie, </p><p> </p><p>Given how badly she had to squint without glasses while on Jimmy Fallon, those look like the prescription she needs.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jan</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2016, 04:22</p><p>On the last episode of 'The Magicians' S01E05, there were two scenes with a "Dr. Meers" (3:30 &amp; 15:30 in incl. closeup). A beautiful woman with a huge pair of spex in the -10 area and a great smile. She seems to be in her early thirties. I couldn't find out who the actress is, because she is not listed in the full cast. Maybe someone here can? I hope she get's a bigger part in the upcoming episodes.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2016, 10:28</p><p>I watched the first hour of the BAFTAs last night and Kate Winslet came on to present an award with Idris Elba. Kate looked beautiful and Idris looked quite nice too, actually (I maybe a woman who prefers women but there's still a bit of me that can admire a good looking man). Kate said something about not having her glasses and then Idris put his hand inside his jacket and took out Kate's glasses from the inside pocket. Kate put her glasses on to read the autocue, looking really gorgeous. Unfortunately she had taken her glasses off by the time the clips of the nominees had finished playing and she was going to announce the winner. Lovely while it lasted. </p><p>Off topic - it shocked me to hear that Kate's school drama teacher told her at the age of 14 she would do ok if she settled for the fat girl parts. What a horrible and stupid thing to say to a teenage girl! As a curvy girl myself I really admire Kate as she has proven that NORMAL shaped girls can be successful and beautiful (which she still is at the age of 40). I'm sure Kate's husband loves her curves and many men (and some women) are perhaps a little bit jealous of him. My girlfriend loves my curves. She may not be as curvy as me but she's not skinny either and I love her.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2016, 05:44</p><p>The award show season with its opportunities for celebrity spec sightings has begun. At the recent "Golden Globes", winner Maura Tierney began her acceptance speech saying, "I'm such a 'four-eyes'...I hate it." as she pushed her spex up.  Thanks Maura for the willingness to wear your stylish spex for us all, especially OOs, to enjoy.  I wonder whether a more attentive optician/fitter could help her with spex not quite so prone to slide down annoyingly.  Nonetheless, she does rock the glasses which do look best when they are sitting properly for her eyes and face.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2015, 06:00</p><p>While the 'GWG best spex on TV' post and choices are focused mainly on characters/actresses who wear spex most or all of the time, there is another "category", those women who are using spex occasionally--like the Good Wife or Mariska Hargitay or....????  and the occasionally capped soap opera actresses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2015, 05:45</p><p>As I enjoy Speximan's posts, I note the choice of uninspired choice of frames for "Supergirl"--they barely fit her face and certainly are not the least bit stylish.  If memory serves way back when, when Wonder Woman first arrived, her spex were also simply for the disguising the superheroine, but later Linda Carter began to  wear more and more stylish and contemporary frames.  Perhaps Supergirl will follow her path as time marches on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2015, 03:21</p><p>Anonymous poster Dec 27th. - Speximan has put up a lot of Supergirl pics but only about the same as he put up for a different actress in a different show a few days before. Anyway, why are you complaining about so many pictures of an extremely fanciable actress wearing glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Dec 2015, 10:43</p><p>Speximann </p><p>The soap opera "Days of our Lifes" has quite a history of young ladies on the show wearing glasses from time to time. The show is taped on a daily basis so if a cast member has a contact lens problem they usually just wear their real glasses. I recall some years ago the young daughter on the show I believe her name was Brittney Snow. A cute petite blond girl suddenly wore glasses for a full day and nothing was in the story line to explain why she was now wearing glasses. I made a point to watch the next day and sure enough now she wasn't wearing glasses. So she must have had some type of contact lens problem and you could clearly tell that her glasses were not all that weak. But there have been countless others out of nowhere suddenly be wearing glasses for a day or 2 and then not again. So I would bet that the glasses that Arianna Zucker is wearing are her own glasses that she wears in real life. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2015, 14:55</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p>We like the show because she is a female superhero. Too many male superheroes! That's nothing to do with us being gay women, just us being women. </p><p>I agree that big Hipster glasses wouldn't look right but frames that were just a little wider would be better. </p><p>That scene in "Not Another Teen Movie" is obviously mocking all those cheesy films where the female becomes 'more beautiful' when her glasses come off and her hair is let down. </p><p>Yes, I did know Calista Flockhart was married to Harrison Ford. He's a lucky man, she's very pretty. She's lucky too as he's very handsome and seems to be a genuinely nice person in interviews I've seen. I don't know what she's like in real life. My mum fancies him and my dad fancies Calista!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2015, 12:49</p><p>   On the subject of super hero shows &amp; GWGs, I have been pleasantly surprised with the Arrow or now Green Arrow series' character Felicity (Emily Bett Richards)who plays the arrow's tech wizard &amp; now also the Main character's love interest. She is almost always wearing glasses in every episode this year. &amp; actually  very hot.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2015, 11:10</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I'm sure you were enjoying every minute while you were discussing "Supergirl's" glasses with 3 other very attractive young ladies that all wear glasses and you fancy all 3 of them. Like you girls I have to admit to being a fan of the show as well. When I first saw promos of the show I was really afraid that they would only have her wearing glasses at limited times, but to my surprise she is wearing glasses the majority of the time in every episode so far. She really only takes her glasses off when she is Supergirl. Early on I read that the reason she wears glasses is not only as a disguise but her glasses minimizes her laser eyes. This I assume is why she even has her glasses on when she is alone in her apartment or with James. She commented once before the show even aired that she had to try on a huge number of glasses before they decided the perfect ones for her to wear. Personally I have to disagree with you ladies about her glasses being too big for her face. I really think they are the perfect size for her. If they had gone with the larger size "hipster" glasses I think they would have looked fake and the whole idea of Supergirl is hard enough to believe so if her glasses looked fake that wouldn't help sell the show. Of course that is only my opinion.  </p><p>A few things you may find of interest. You mentioned that it would be nice if her adoptive sister also wore glasses. Funny I have thought the same thing myself while watching the show. I had a look at her twitter page that you attached and it appears that she must wear glasses or contacts full time when off camera based on the number of pictures of her wearing glasses. Are you aware that Chyler Leigh is the same girl that was the lead actress several years ago in a very popular movie. You may want to look it up at some point. The name of the movie is "Not Another Teen movie" For about the first half of the movie she is a teen girl that doesn't seem to have much interest in her appearance and wears bib overalls, with her hair up and of course glasses and no makeup. A friend of a friend's gf come over to give her a makeover. Of course the first hing she does is remove her glasses. In the movie they even have her remove her glasses in slow motion for effect. Then the hair is let down and she gives her head a shake and her hair looks perfect. A little makeup and a nice dress and like magic she is transformed into a godest. Funny thing is that the glasses she wore in the movie look exactly like the glasses she has on in her twitter pictures. So she must have liked the glasses she wore in that movie if she wears nearly the same today. Also I don't have a clue why Calista Flockhart has so many pairs of glasses on her desk all the time. I assume because she is so rich she has all different styles to pick from? But did you know that she is married to Harrison Ford? They have been married since 2004. Mr. Ford is about to appear in the new "Star Wars" movie which opens here on December 18th. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2015, 15:53</p><p>Me and Gemma were chatting with our friends Danielle and the coffee shop server at the weekend and we happened to get on to the subject of Supergirl. We all fancy her as the superhero and as the timid office girl. Danielle said that Kara could do with different glasses as the ones she wears seem a little small for her face. After looking at a couple of photos of her (to refresh our memories, of course!) we agreed with Danielle. Another thing that I thought of but didn't mention was the number of pairs of reading glasses Kara's boss has on her desk. At least one pair must be Calista Flockhart's own reading glasses as they have + lenses in them. </p><p>It's a pity Kara's adoptive sister doesn't wear glasses as the rather hot Chyler Leigh, who plays her, wears glasses in real life. A few pics on her Twitter page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.twitter.com/chy_leigh/media" target="_blank">http://www.twitter.com/chy_leigh/media</a> Her character is giving me the impresssion that she might a lady who prefers ladies.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2015, 11:12</p><p>eyesnap </p><p>That was a really good glasses wearing movie where for once they didn't try to have the actress lose the glasses and have her hair pulled down like so many other movies. She seems to wear her glasses throughout and looks beautiful all the while. I have never heard of the actress? Curious if she was wearing her actual prescription in the movie? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2015, 11:54</p><p>I happened to come across an old TV show that must have aired in the 70's. I'm not sure sure how i never saw it before, but to be honest the show didn't look all that well written and probably didn't last too long on air. The lead actress was a very pretty young lady my the the name of "Joanna Cameron" again not a name I ever recall seeing before or after. She plays a high school teacher that has super powers much like "Wonder Woman" As the teacher she wears glasses pretty much full time but she does sometimes manage to take them off for no apparent reason. You can find episodes of this show on You Tube. The name of the show is "The Secrets of Isis"  (It has nothing to do with the terrorists group.) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2015, 12:42</p><p>Thank you Specs4Me.  I know what I am talking about.  I've been acting in movies and been on television long enough to know the truth.  I think it was Strangers on a Train from Alfred Hitchcock, but there are tons of other examples. </p><p> </p><p>I don't think sitting in front of 3 tv shows as an audience member qualifies you as an expert in this category.  sorry  lol. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2015, 12:19</p><p>Specs4Me and Annoying One </p><p>Yes you are right and in fact I also read that same thing about the movie "Strangers on the Train". So without a doubt there can be exceptions. But in the case of Mr Hitchcock he seemed to be a bit obsessed with his leading ladies wearing glasses.  </p><p>I did not know that the glasses that she wore are actually in a museum somewhere.  </p><p>Thanks to both of you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Edie</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2015, 12:14</p><p>Specs4Me  </p><p> </p><p>That Hitchcock movie made a very long time ago, I think most of the things has changed in Hollywood since then. </p><p> </p><p>I have some actor friends, they are not famous at all, but trying to make it in LA.  </p><p>One of them had some little parts in TV series and bad movies. He wears glasses IRL, he's shortsighted, maybe 2-3 dpt. Some of his characters have glasses, but they always tell him, not to wear his real glasses, because their reflections are not the same as the props with the plano. But I guess it depends on the role, and the director, too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Annoying One</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2015, 12:07</p><p>Specs4Me </p><p> </p><p>For future reference, the movie is called "Strangers on a Train."  :-) </p><p> </p><p>It's also said that the actress kept a pair of the thick glasses that are in a museum in Portland, Oregon.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2015, 11:46</p><p>I think the movie was Murder on the Train in which Alfred Hitchcock had the main character wear very strong glasses that were not hers, she stated in an interview that she could see nothing when wearing the glasses.  She mentioned that she would have her hand on the counter whenever possible to help orient herself.  The fact is that there have been situations in which actors/actresses have worn glasses that were not their real prescription but only for as short a time as necessary. </p><p> </p><p>I agree that in the scene on the roof there was a slight minification in the left lens, indicating that she is mildly nearsighted.  I suspect that she is quite able to function without correction much of the time that she is not wearing glasses and that for scenes when she needs good vision she is wearing contacts.  Just my $0.02 worth.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2015, 11:35</p><p>Unnamed </p><p>I really don't think they would ever have their actress wear prescription glasses just to make the scene more realistic when most people other than us crazies in here are likely the only ones that pays any attention to such things. Also in filming a scene that is only a few seconds on air can sometimes take numerous takes to get right so longer than what you may think.  </p><p>I have been to tapings of several TV shows that are filmed in front of live audiences and you may find it interesting to know that most all of them are taped in front of 3 different audiences and then they spice the best of the 3 together. And of course during each taping they will often stop and reshoot if a mistake is made. Oh and besides the 3 tapings in front of live audiences they also do a brief run without an audience.  </p><p>That show that aired last night likely took at least 3 - 4 weeks to film. This is why most shows only run for about 12 weeks because it takes so long to film each one. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2015, 11:01</p><p>No it doesn't mean Supergirl is nearsighted.   </p><p> </p><p>Hollywood actors often wear prescription glasses as props to look authentic; it doesn't matter whether the actress needs them or not.  You might be horrified by this, but consider each scene is filmed separately for only a few seconds to a few minutes.  So the strain of wearing glasses is not that bad.   </p><p> </p><p>Assuming she is really nearsighted might be a mistake for another reason... at least 3/4 of the show she is not wearing glasses.  The heavier weight toward scenes without glasses makes me wonder if she really needs them at all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2015, 09:07</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I watched the first episode of "Supergirl" and as I expected she mostly only wears her glasses when she is at work, but she also tends to leave them on while at home and at times as well. I didn't record the show but watched closely to see if the glasses she wears has any prescription in them. Finally with about 6 or 7 minutes left James Olson (aka Jimmy Olsen) while at work asks her to meet him on the roof. At that point he lets her know that he knows that she is the cousin of Superman. During there chat the camera gets behind her in such a way the your able to see through her left lens of her glasses and you can see that things are indeed minified meaning that she is nearsighted and her glasses are very real. </p><p>An added bonus of sorts is that Calista Flockhart who plays her boss also can be seen for a few seconds wearing some readers which also are clearly very real. For those that don't know she is married to Harrison Ford and has been for some time now. Like you say Carrie for being 50 she still looks very good. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2015, 07:41</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Here in the US "Supergirl" will air tonight. I plan on watching it as I have seen several previews of the show and she seems to wear glasses quite often in her day to day activities and at work. Sadly i don't think she is in glasses full time like we got used to seeing Clark Kent. I don't get the idea that her wearing glasses is meant as any kind of disguise like glasses were for Clark Kent.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2015, 16:53</p><p>I've just seen a trailer for Supergirl in the UK! It's going to be shown on Sky 1 from Thursday. She was only shown in glasses for a few seconds in the trailer but thanks to Eyescene I know she wears them more during the series. Gemma also saw the trailer and said she wouldn't mind watching it. She admitted that her main interest is Supergirl herself, so I said it was the same for me too! Another one to be added to our "allowed" lists! </p><p>I was worried at first that Supergirl was going to be shown on a channel we can't get on our cable TV package but we can get Sky 1. Calista Flockhart was also in the trailer holding a pair of glasses. She certainly doesn't look 50!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2015, 08:28</p><p>RK City 72 </p><p>Nice find! I don't recall even seeing when this movie came out any previews for it. But in "googling" it there are several clips as well previews of the movie. It appears that Camilla Bell wears glasses off and on throughout the movie and from what I could tell in the clips her glasses seem to have at least some prescription in them. Also it was nice to see that unlike so many movies the girl doesn't go from being a "plain Jane" to a sudden beauty just by losing her glasses and letting her hair down. This young lady is beautiful right from the start. Like you I have it down as a movie I am planning on renting and maybe even buying. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus Tony</b>&nbsp;03 Oct 2015, 02:22</p><p>I was looking at that photo of Jenna trying to work out whether she is short or long sighted. Looking at her right lens there seems to be a tiny bit of cut in but the lenses seem to magnify her eyes a bit. What do the experts think? I'm new here (at least in terms of posting and actually wearing glasses) and as I have only had them for a little less than a week I may not be fully adjusted yet and my judgement may be off! </p><p></p><hr>

After Saturday's episode there was a trailer for next week's episode which included a close up of one of her eyes. When I paused the shot  I'm sure I could just make out the outline of a contact lens. If you don't know what she looks like then do Google her as she is a very attractive petite lady. </p><p>If anyone has seen a photo of Jenna wearing glasses please post the link.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;24 Sep 2015, 04:46</p><p>The autumnal roll out of new shows and new seasons of old shows here in the USA is always an opportunity to discover and enjoy actors in spex.  For instance, Supergirl will likely have plenty of 'Clark Kent' moments for the title character. Spex may also show up on actresses who were bare-eyed up to now (I recall both Law and Order SVU and The Good Wife offering such moments)and new glasses/frames on others who had been bespectacled (Modern Family). </p><p></p><hr>

Her character sometimes wears reading glasses. The glasses don't always appear when they should, as is quite common in tv dramas. The drama is set in the 1950s.

<p><b>KL</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2015, 09:39</p><p>On the general topic of actresses and glasses - isn't it frustrating how often they *don't* wear glasses on screen although they do the rest of the time? I get that they're held to certain standards of beauty/appearance more demanding than for the general population (not saying I *agree* with them, though), but the characters that are created are even more 'unreal' in that sense.  </p><p> </p><p>To take Orange is the New Black as an example, I've seen pictures of several of the actresses in glasses off screen and yet the only ones to also wear them on the show are Lori Petty (whatever her character's name is - can't remember) and Red to a small extent.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KL</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2015, 09:30</p><p>Soundmanpt - Laura Prepon's glasses are plano/props. Her character Alex is nearsighted and wears them pretty much all the time - in one episode I think she called herself "moderately blind" without them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2015, 09:20</p><p>eyesnap </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for posting the pictures of Laura Prepon. I always hoped when she was on "That 70's Show" that she would somehow start wearing glasses but of course it never happened. I don't pay extra for the cable show she is on now. (Orange is the New Black) so I keep hoping at some point it may star to shown on a regular cable network. She wears glasses quite often on this show, I have never heard if the glasses are only props or if they are prescription glasses? Has anyone ever seen any comments about her glasses? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2015, 12:48</p><p>Yes, that's the show, about 2:10 into it.  I do not recall anyone asking me if I had obtained new glasses when said person had already seen me in the particular pair.  Of course, with the money that the contestant won, that would have bought "a lot of many" pairs of glasses, in different styles, colors, and sizes, much different from the small selections of the past 20-some years.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2015, 08:09</p><p>Also last week on Match Game '79, Nancy Lowe, a contestant originally from Minnesota, wore very large brown/orange/tortoiseshell frames, something similar to what I had two years later.  Her prescription was very strong, as evidenced by the power rings when the camera showed her close up at a 45-degree angle.  On her second day, host Gene Rayburn asked her if she had gotten new glasses.  She said no, that they were still the same pair.  Old Gene really had trouble with eyewear last week.  It's as though he had been wearing Brett Somers' strong glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;24 May 2015, 17:17</p><p>I wouldn't say I was an expert, just someone that finds her extremely attractive. But I have seen a lot of photos of her mostly with glasses on. I can't tell for sure if any of the frames she's worn over the last few years had prescription lenses. Sometimes it does look like she has prescription lenses. I have read that extract from an interview before where she admits the glasses she is wearing are non-prescription. That was a few years ago and she could need a prescription now. </p><p>I agree she does look better without loads of makeup on.(I prefer women who don't wear loads of makeup. I feel they are trying to hide something if they wear heavy makeup) She's naturally beautiful - fantastic bone structure. She chooses her glasses well. The character she played in a recent film wore glasses similar in style to the ones she often wears in real life. I wonder if she got the job of promoting Chanel eyewear because she is so often seen wearing fashionable glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;24 May 2015, 10:29</p><p>I am not a big fan of Kristen Stewart even though at times i find her very attractive. She is actually one of those young ladies that really look much better without the tons of makeup. But there have been so many pictures of her wearing glasses over there past few years and the ones where you can get a decent closeup of her glasses they sure seem to have a low distance prescription in them. I think she is nearsighted (shortsigted) and just doesn't want to admit it for some reason. Maybe she thinks it will make her less than perfect, who knows? </p><p>Carrie is the real expert on Kristen. So what say you? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 May 2015, 10:18</p><p>I just the first trailer for "Supergirl" and nice to see that the young female star seems to wear glasses most all the time except when she changes into "Supergirl" Even better from what I was able to tell in a few close ups of her wearing glasses the glasses she wears seems to have prescription lenses, meaning they are in her real prescription of course. I like it that don't try and downplay her glasses by making them appear on the ugly side. Her glasses are in fact very trendy and she looks very cute wearing them. This is a new series coming in the fall. I look forward to watching it.  </p><p>Also a made for TV movie is currently running on the Lifetime Channel. The name of the movie is "The Wrong Girl" and it features 2 late aged teens becoming friends. They are both really attractive and one of them wears a pair of really stylish Ray Bans in a modern day style cat-eye shape. Nice to see that that is no doubt the glasses she is wearing is in her prescription. More than one view through her lenses where you can clearly see everything is minified.  </p><p>So nice to see more and more shows featuring attractive young ladies wearing glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;07 May 2015, 12:31</p><p>New comedy on Channel 4 in the UK called Bugsplat. One of the female characters wears glasses. I haven't been able to work out if they are prescription or just props. You can see a clip here <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.channel4.com/programmes/bugsplat/videos/all/s1-ep1-wiki-leak" target="_blank">http://www.channel4.com/programmes/bugsplat/videos/all/s1-ep1-wiki-leak</a> . If you register (free) you can watch the show online (also free). I have no idea if the clip or watching online will work outside the UK. I hope it does.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2015, 14:35</p><p>Dahl, </p><p> </p><p>my guess - based on all the pictures - is minus eight or minus nine. The massive cut in effect in her enlarged portrait on top would suggest low double digits. But I often noticed during photo shoots that there is more cut in as you zoom in with the camera. Anyway, it's definitely a strong prescription. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Looking at all the pictures it is hard to tell for sure if her character is going to be wearing glasses or not. Many of the pictures I have seen appear to be behind the scenes and off camera. There seems to be as many pictures of her in street clothes not wearing glasses.

I've never heard of her before but apparently she was in Glee - never seen that though.  </p><p>The glasses her character wears aren't too nerdy just slightly nerdy and still "normal". They actually suit her very well. I don't think I'll go and see it at the cinema - not really into super hero films even if the star is very attractive. I might watch it when it comes on tv in a few years time. I expect there'll be many more photos to come including high quality official promo photos when the film is released.

I only remember seeing a few men in glasses. I didn't recognise most of them but Michael Keaton was one of the ones I did recognise but he took his glasses off when he went on stage to receive an award. Considering how many people there were in the audience the number of glasses seen was very low and it was virtually zero for the women.</p><p></p><hr>

Even though I've got anti virus on here, and a firewall, I cannot remove "omiga-plus" which has placed itself as a toolbar on my browser, and caused a couple of other problems! </p><p>  </p><p> </p><p>The real reason for posting here this morning though is that Anne Kirkbride has passed away after a short illness, and the relatively young age of 60. Back in the day when wearing big glasses wasn't fashionable, there was Anne Kirkbride - who played Deidre Barlow on Coronation Street - wearing a variety of big frames that brought her a lot of attention from the media. She was a real icon in the acting / soap world, and will be sorely missed. RIP.&#65279; </p><p> </p><p>In her youth she was nicknamed "Miss Sexy Spex" and attracted a lot of attention from the media for her choice of big / oversized glasses. I even recall about 15 years ago one of the tabloid newspapers in England having a centre spread featuring all the different glasses she had worn over the years. She was a soap icon, and less importantly, a great believer in big is better glasses. </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/film-news/gallery/anne-kirkbride-who-played-deirdre-8477715#ICID=sharebar_google+" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/film-news/gallery/anne-kirkbride-who-played-deirdre-8477715#ICID=sharebar_google+</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2015, 08:36</p><p>I recently saw a promo for at the time an upcoming episode also showing her wearing glasses but of course I forgot to watch it when it aired. I don't watch that show on a weekly basis but have seen a number of shows and she never wore glasses something you would think a hard working lawyer would soon need based on the amount of paperwork they do everyday. Interesting that after so many years that show has been on that she is first now being seen wearing glasses. Maybe they wanted the viewers to assume that she wore contacts?  </p><p>Now an even more interesting question is now that she has been seen wearing glasses will she be wearing glasses when she is reading from now on? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2015, 05:38</p><p>According to some tweets around November 10 (2014), actress Julianna Margulies, who stars in the CBS Sunday drama, The Good Wife, as Alicia Florick, had worn glasses in a recent episode. Is anyone aware of videos or caps of her being bespectacled from there--or anywhere?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2014, 11:09</p><p>Maybe they should do a remake with Kristin Stewart as Buffy. She's used to vampires! Ha ha! She's probably too old to play Buffy now but I can imagine her kicking the sh*t out some vampire while looking gorgeous and wearing one of the pairs of dark framed glasses she has. SMG is also gorgeous and it's great to see her wearing real glasses, but I do prefer brunettes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2014, 09:04</p><p>Speximann </p><p> </p><p>Just think how much faster she would have been able to kill off all those vampires if they just didn't look so blurry to her. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2014, 21:08</p><p>  So if Buffy didn't wear her glasses, did that give the Vampires an advantage??????     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2014, 11:24</p><p>lazysiow </p><p>You were probably about right about Sarah Michelle Gellers glasses being in the area of +1.50 or +2.00 when you saw that picture of her wearing glasses off camera. Someone must have seen her struggling to see and thought it was bad enough that they needed to get her eyes examined. And if she says the doctor even commented on how poor her vision was it's not at all surprising that she likely was wearing glasses full time when not on camera.  </p><p>Thanks "FaNaTiKX" for finding and posting that picture of her wearing glasses on set of "Buffy" </p><p>Too bad that back then the producers of most shows never wanted their female stars to be wearing glasses. I'm sure she probably been fine with wearing glasses her character on Buffy and why not since she was portrayed to be in school so having her wear glasses as a school girl would have been most fitting. And much like Superman or Wonder Woman she could have taken her glasses off when she was fighting vampires if she wanted to.  </p><p>So I wonder if they were ever to do a new version of Buffy if they might have that girl wear glasses since glasses have become much more exceptable in so many shows recently? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Dec 2014, 09:40</p><p>Katherine Heigl has been wearing glasses for a good while and there has been quite a good number of pictures posted in here of here off camera out and about wearing glasses which she seems to wear quite a bit even long before this new show was even thought about. So yes she is no doubt wearing glasses that are her own nearsighted prescription and I would think she has to be pleased being able to see comfortably with her glasses on. </p><p>In the past there has been a few pictures of Tea Leoni wearing glasses off screen as well, just not as many. She is also wearing glasses that are most likely made in her prescription as well. And yes they are plus lenses.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>kisal</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2014, 07:26</p><p>Saw an amazing movie last night called "Clouds of Sils Maria":  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2452254/" target="_blank">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2452254/</a>  It is a French film, but most of the dialogue is in English.  Cinematically it is very good, but what makes it amazing is Kristen Stewart who wears very nice glasses for, I would say 80% of her screen time (and she is the second-billed star after Juliette Binoche).  I was of course annoyed when she took them off, but at least the timing of removing them usually made sense for her character, when swimming, at the end of the day when she was tired, etc.  There is a wonderful montage of her bespectacled face as she is driving in the rain and fog. </p><p> </p><p>Here are some links: </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.filmofilia.com/four-new-clouds-of-sils-maria-photos-kristen-stewart-juliette-binoche-173525/" target="_blank">http://www.filmofilia.com/four-new-clouds-of-sils-maria-photos-kristen-stewart-juliette-binoche-173525/</a> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/review-kristen-stewart-is-best-in-show-in-airy-clouds-of-sils-maria" target="_blank">http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/review-kristen-stewart-is-best-in-show-in-airy-clouds-of-sils-maria</a> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/tag/clouds-of-sils-maria/" target="_blank">http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/tag/clouds-of-sils-maria/</a> </p><p> </p><p>and there are of course many more to be googled. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2014, 10:19</p><p>I used to watch "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" all the time and I always hoped since she played a college girl that at some point they might have her character wearing glasses at least while she was in class. Of courser that never happened but who knew that at 19 her vision was so bad that when she was found to need glasses that her optometrists told her she was "as blind as a bat" and that she was likely wearing glasses full time off camera. Funny that it took so many years for this to come out and yet she doesn't seem to mind it being known. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2014, 15:59</p><p>As  someone in the US who was very aware of the beautiful glasses made in the mid-50s thru the mid-60s (I was born in 1942) I can tell you that in the late 60s women threw away their beautiful cat eye glasses and replaced them with granny glasses so they could look like John Lennon. I'm still scrathing my head trying to figure out that one.  </p><p> </p><p>It was really hard to find any of these old cat eye glasses until eBay. Using eBay I've built up a nice collection of these glasses in good enough shape that opticians have been able to put lenses in them, and they look good. Also, Shuron is still making a nice cat eye that they've made all along. Look for NuLady and NuLady DeLuxe. These frames are available new online in the $60.00 to $90.00 Price range. </p><p> </p><p>If you ever want to use some of these beautiful old glasses in one of your photo-shoots, let me know and I will lend you a few. </p><p> </p><p>I've enjoy all your photo-shoots. I thought the last two were especially good.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2014, 05:45</p><p>Here in the Eastern Time Zone of the good old USA, the only cat's-eyes I have seen live and in color besides my own have been some at my favorite eyewear establishment, but I will not dole out $300 for a complete pair, even if they had blue ones, which is my top desire at this time.  I found that out when I was there and a woman a bit younger than I am wore large black cat's-eyes, and the optician told me what the price was.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2014, 17:48</p><p>Crystal Veil, </p><p> </p><p>I have been collecting used glasses fromm thrift stores for over three years. I have only one pair of cat eyes and the plastic has cracks in it.Plus and minus lenticulars are something that I have never found.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2014, 16:13</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>you live in the USA or am I mistaken? Amazing to hear that you came across lots of vintage cat eye glasses only a few years ago. In the Netherlands, cat eye glasses disappeared from those charity boxes during the 1980's and most glasses from that era in my collection are broken because the old plastics simply started to crumble. Did cat eye glasses remain fashionable in your area long after the mid 1960's? What you write about opticians digging in charity boxes themselves makes sense to me. Over the years, I understood that this is done by some opticians here as well, albeit not on a large scale. Sorry if this is all off topic for other readers of this thread about actresses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2014, 12:05</p><p>eyesnap </p><p> </p><p>I really love the glasses they have come up with for her character to wear. I used to see a good number of them a few years ago turn up in the donation boxes I would be picking up. I finally after  good while started hanging onto a number of the ones in good condition.  </p><p>After a while I found that many of the opticians were going through the box before I came to make my pickup. They even told me they did it. Kind of asking if it was okay to take them. We were lucky they allowed us to keep a box in there store so I couldn't tell them no even if I wanted to. This was back in the days when many of the stores had their own lab in house so many of the girls would come across glasses in the box and have their lab guy cut new lenses in their prescription so they could wear them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gemma</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2014, 13:50</p><p>Speaking of dreams, Carrie, I had one about you where I wore your glasses while you were licking my lady parts.

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2014, 12:48</p><p>I had a dream last night where I saw Jennifer Lawrence in her Katniss costume from the Hunger Games (like this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://assets-s3.usmagazine.com/uploads/assets/articles/77484-the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-i-trailer-released-video/1410798543_jennifer-lawrence-zoom.jpg" target="_blank">http://assets-s3.usmagazine.com/uploads/assets/articles/77484-the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-i-trailer-released-video/1410798543_jennifer-lawrence-zoom.jpg</a> ) but she was wearing some slightly battered metal rimmed glasses. A wonderful dream! Nothing sexual happened in the dream but I do find Jennifer rather sexy as Katniss. It got me thinking that there are very few photos of Jennifer wearing glasses. There's this one <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://coolspotters.com/files/photos/972176/jennifer-lawrence-gallery.jpg" target="_blank">http://coolspotters.com/files/photos/972176/jennifer-lawrence-gallery.jpg</a> and a couple of others taken at the same time as she's wearing the same black dress. There's this one which is a bit older <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://coolspotters.com/files/photos/970912/jennifer-lawrence-gallery.jpg?1357403591" target="_blank">http://coolspotters.com/files/photos/970912/jennifer-lawrence-gallery.jpg?1357403591</a> but that seems to be it. I have seen another one but it's clearly fake. Is there any newer ones? I've heard she doesn't have a Facebook or Twitter account so if you find one that's saying it's hers then it's a fake so no chance of any selfies with glasses on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2014, 05:09</p><p>Thanks to you, Speximan, for another set of high-quality caps.  Enjoyed seeing Alyssa in a wardrobe of styles and shapes, tho, all are in the brown-tone portion of the color palette--no colors like we've seen recently on Betty Liu. And, the plano pix highlight the divide in our world of OO's between the LL's and the FF's. I count myself in the latter, the FF's (frame fanatics) as anything is better than nothing (even 'nothing' or plano  in the frames). And, perhaps Alyssa will respond to the Lens Lovers (LL) by wearing her real glasses now and again. Hopefully, Speximan will be able to serve us all by posting the pix when that occurs. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2014, 15:11</p><p>  SoundManpt, sadly that's the world of TV, Movies, &amp; Advertising. Alot of Women have been programed to believe anything other than the status quo isn't sexy,attractive, or marketable. A website I stumbled onto years back from a post on this site has some beautiful models sometimes wearing glasses for the effect of their content. At that time I questioned the fact that lots (but not all) of the shoots in which the girls wore glasses were done with lens-less frames which looked pretty stupid for a site specializing in "Tease" type photo shoots. Happy to say that almost never happens now. Some of their regular models wear their own glasses in their shoots although none have a very strong Rx, but they now use a good selection of planos which is tons better than lens-less frames. Their photographer is very good at shooting these ladies &amp; managing the glare. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2014, 15:10</p><p>Revolver </p><p> </p><p>They jsut don't think anyone knows anything about vision, She was no doubt wearing her actual prescription because she is nearsighted in real life and has been seen wearing glasses quite often.  </p><p>Even a better question why not make her what she is, nearsighted and let her wear glasses more often? </p><p> Why would it be wrong to see wearing glasses while driving or at other times and if they insist that she not be wearing glasses full time so be it then let her go without them, as if her rx is just a weak one. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2014, 11:48</p><p>Watched the pilot episode of State Of Affairs last night, kind of a strange scene.  Early on Katherine sat down in from of her computer, and put on a delightful pair of black clunky glasses to type etc.  Problem is, they're low minus which wouldn't be needed for that task, and she didn't wear anything at any other time in the show.  TV and movie directors need to hire one of us as a consultant.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2014, 10:08</p><p>Speximann </p><p> </p><p>Yes they are not even plano but rather lensless which is even worse. Sadly these frame dealers don't seem to get itdo they. Putting their frames on an attractive woman without lenses does very little to see their frames. Of course the reason is simple the photographer doesn't have enough talent to do a shoot and not have unwanted glare on the lenses. So it is much esier to not have any lenses in the frames. They really need to get in contact with the master, our very own "Crystal Veil" who is expert at this and does it with older glasses that don't even have anti reflective lenses.  </p><p>I can tell you that Alyssa Milano does in fact wear prescription glasses and as for a while now. There was pictures a few years ago of her at a Dodgers baseball game with her wearing glasses, most likely meaning that she is nearsighted. She admits to being a huge Dodger fan and is seen often at their games no doubt wearing glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2014, 13:14</p><p>GWG </p><p> </p><p>So "Arrow" is just now going to start airing in the UK? I think it has just started the 3rd season here, but remember I didn't notice it until recently myself so I am not sure. I am hoping they might pick ot up on another channel and re-run from the beginning so I can watch all the ones I have missed. I guess you can already tell from the clips that unlike so many shows they do the old "scruffy, geeky, nerdy girl with glasses suddenly take off her glasses and lets her hair down and a simple twist and she is changed into a real stunner. She is a stunner wearing glasses and she pretty much seems to keep them on most all the time. So far I have only seen a few rare times when she has her glasses off. And of course she is stunning that way as well.  </p><p>Yes, "Hollyoaks" I have seen bits and pieces of it in here but here in the US we never ever got that show here. I have seen many caps of Lisa Kay and I totally agree that she is a "hottie" I do recall some one saying that she did in fact wear her own prescription glasses off camera. Now Unless her prescription was so high that they felt like her glasses would make he eyes look too small or make her less desirable in some way I wonder why the didn't allow her to wear her own glasses or have glasses made up for her in her prescription if they wanted a certain look about her glasses? Even more odd in several of the caps you posted they didn't bother getting AR coating (anti-reflective) put on her lenses and you can even see the studio lights reflecting off of them badly. </p><p>I also saw an ad for another show that I have never watched and it showed an attractive woman wearing glasses kissing her male star. I missed the episode though so I ma not sure if she is a regular or just a bit player. the show is "Sleepy Hollow"       </p><p></p><hr>

My husband and I make a lot of good use of our DVR/VCR, whether it's to record something on TV late or to play our plethora of programs from way back when (with "Batman" due to be delivered in a day or so). </p><p> </p><p>Also, you may want to check out "Cannonball Run" from 1981, in which Farrah Fawcett sometimes wore large, gold-colored plastic frames.  Back then I wore a brown pair similar in style -- that's before I began my colossal collection.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2014, 05:33</p><p>In a restaurant yesterday I glanced up at the TV that was on in the corner and was pleased to see a woman wearing glasses.  This got my attention and as I watched, I saw it was a CNN clip of Mariska Hargitay from 'Law and Order SVU'. I've long thought that she was a hottie and she's been one of the women I've hoped to someday see in glasses. So, I checked around the inet a bit and found a few pix of her in various pairs of glasses on Twitter. </p><p>Julianna Margulies of 'The Good Wife' is another attractive (imho) actress who I'd never seen wearing spex over the years, but, spurred on by the Mariska discovery, I did a bit of twitter-ing and found that she had also just recently appeared wearing glasses. </p><p>On Twitter there were tons of tweets about how wonderful these women looked in their eyewear and imploring the directors of their respective TV shows to have them wear glasses often, even always. </p><p>Maybe some of our generous cappers can/will post pix of these two hotties wearing their spex.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2014, 02:45</p><p>Soundman - I think you can get your DVD player 'chipped' which means it will work as a multi region player. I don't know how its done but as another person has suggested, Google it and see. </p><p> </p><p>I always ensure that my Blu-ray players are multi region for precisely this region as you therefore don't have to worry about whether those DVDs you bought at the airport, or on eBay US will work. </p><p> </p><p>With regard to Arrow, I don't know what season these stills were from as I didn't note anything from the blurb that went with the video, but I've favourited them on my YouTube Channel, so you can find them there if you want to see them - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.youtube.com/sexygirlswithglasses" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/sexygirlswithglasses</a> </p><p> </p><p>When I got home last night I flicked on the TV and ironically happened to see an advert for "the all new series Arrow" on Sky. This is showing either on Sky Atlantic, or Sky One - can't remember, but this will be the first series of which it has already been noted she is wearing prescription glasses in. </p><p> </p><p>There was a similarly strange occurrence with a young lady and her glasses in a show I used to watch when I was at college. The show was called Hollyoaks and featured a sexy young beauty - Lisa Kay who played Anna Green, a vicars daughter who was a student at a sixth form college. During her several year stint on this soap, she wore - iirc - 8 different pairs of glasses all in the same large round style. Sometimes they would have a plano appearance to them, and sometimes I could quite distinctly see a prescription in them. Like you Soundman, I used to watch, with my eyes peeled fascinated by this young beauty and her (in this case) big glasses, and to my delight found on a webchat session that she confirmed that she did wear glasses off screen, but she was very rarely seen with them (must have been a contact lens wearer). It obviously served the casting director well that she wore glasses, as she played a geeky, downtrodden girl, and her glasses added quite a bit to this character they wanted to portray. </p><p> </p><p>As you might expect from me, I have a photostream of vidcaps I made back in the day of her - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.flickr.com/photos/lisakayfan" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/lisakayfan</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2014, 10:31</p><p>The movie "The Tennent" was a very strange movie with a beautiful actress that wore glasses throughout the movie and I saw it at the theater and never forgot about it because of the actress wearing glasses. The movie was very weird and i could never begin to tell you what the plot was. But it left a lasting memory because of that girl. Anyway i saw where it could be purchased on Amizon and I bought the DVD. I was so excited to put it in and play it. Anyway it turned out they sent be the forgein version which could not be played in US DVD machines for some reason. So not sure what to do with this DVD now and I really would like to be able watch that movie that I never forgot? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2014, 10:18</p><p>Thanks to both "oliquinn" and "GWG" for your research on "Felicity" Sadly I only recently came across this show as I don't watch all that much TV except really late, not much prime time. But once i came across this show i have tried to make a point to be home at the time it airs because of her. I am not even sure how many seasons it has been airing. "oliquinn" said that in the first season the glasses she was wearing appeared to be a plus prescription, but more recent ones she is wearing plano lenses. Not sure why they would decide to do that if she really has a need for glasses.  </p><p>I must assume then that the videos I came across might have been more recent shows because I am sure when I stopped the action at various points where you could see through her lenses at things in the background there was no distortion at all and they appeared to be plano. However seeing the stills that "GWG" sent her glasses very much do appear to have prescription lenses. So I wonder if those pictures are from season one then and "oliquinn "is correct that for some reason she now wears plano lenses. I guess we can maybe assume that after the first season she could have gotten lasik or something and no longer requires glasses?  </p><p>At any rate, thanks again.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Nov 2014, 13:05</p><p>Last week the "Arrow" TV show featured the glasses wearing female star. It showed her as a very pretty young lady sexy casual look much like she maybe had just graduated from College. But she was not yet wearing glasses. You were left to assume that her job working at a computer must have brought on the need for her to now need glasses.  </p><p>The real shame is that recently i viewed many of the previous shows on You Tube and I tried to se if the glasses she wears has any kind of prescription in them. It took a lot of stopping at just the right point trying to see through her lenses at the perfect angle to see if anything behind her appeared minified or out of focus but even things in the background with straight edges were unchanged through her glasses meaning they had no visible prescription. So it must mean one of two things. Either her vision is so bad that they don't want her tobe seen wearing very strong glasses or she has good vision still and doesn't need glasses. Most like she doesn't need glasses. if she did need a real prescription I would think because her character wears glasses full time the would allow her to wear glasses in her real prescription.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2014, 12:56</p><p>Marcia Strassman, may she rest in peace, wore glasses on "Welcome Back, Kotter" from January of 1976 through the end of the 1977-78 season.  During that last season she switched from those metal aviators to large plastic frames in different colors.  Unfortunately, she stopped wearing glasses and cut her hair short for the final season.  (My husband thought that was the cause of the lower ratings, not caring that Gabe Kaplan and John Travolta hardly made appearances.) </p><p> </p><p>Soundmanpt, "Bailey Quarters" is Jan Smithers, whom I do not recall having worn glasses outside of her role.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2014, 10:48</p><p>A.P. </p><p>Being from that generation I very well recall Ms. Strassman and her very big and very real glasses that she usually always wore. To be honest it was the only reason I watched the show even though it was pretty funny. It was rare back then to ever see an attractive young woman wearing glasses and even more rare for them to be in a prescription.  </p><p>Around the same time another show featured an attractive young woman also wearing prescription glasses. That was Bailey Quarters, I don't recall her real name even, I think they wanted her to wear glasses so she would be less attractive than Loni Anderson, but sadly after a the first year or so she soon was taking her glasses off quite a bit and then didn't seem to need glasses anymore. I think they feared that Miss Anderson might leave the show so they wanted her to become the new "hot" girl in the office so the glasses had to go. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2014, 13:43</p><p>Kelly Lang is participating to a TV show named (translation) dancing with the stars, where she is learning dancing with a professional dancer partner. Well, last episode she was commented that she is not putting herself too much in dancing since she is not improving as other participants. Astonishingly (for me!) she revealed that without her glasses she is not able to recognise which camera she has to look into and this takes her precious time while dancing trying to spot where the camera is instead of concentrating on the dance! </p><p>I searched for picture of bespectacled Kelly Lang but didn't find on the web.</p><p></p><hr>

Sometimes you have to take the goo with the bad and not complain.

It's a good thing (at least for myself) that these beautiful women are wearing glasses at all with the popularity  of lasik &amp; inexpensive contacts. The stigma of imperfection of any type in today's world works against the whole idea for this site.  Happy anyone goes to the trouble to share their images at all, plano or real, I enjoy them all. I have to admit an actress wearing frames with no glass at all does tend to put me off! Thanks to those who share. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Did people recognize you for it? </p><p>No. I don't dress like that. I wear like the same thing every day, like a shirt and black jeans, and I wear glasses because I can't see and my breasts are nowhere near that large. This happened to me a lot: I would be on the subway or be in the coffee shop or something, and someone would come up to me and ask me if we went to high school together or if they knew me, and that went on for a couple weeks after that episode aired. They could see something. </p><p> </p><p>Cristin appears to have mild exopthalmia sometimes associated with high myopia.  Did a Google search, but could find no photos of her wearing glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2014, 11:23</p><p>I observed the same thing Soundman did, and there were a couple of good scenes with the glasses, but....!  As was so often the custom in those days, at the end of the episode the director wanted to "make her beautiful" and of course had her whip off the glasses and let down her hair.  The worst possible of all the film clichés.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2014, 11:08</p><p>RK City 72 </p><p> </p><p>It was great to see that episode of Fantasy Island. I remember very well watching that show when it was on back in the 70's. But I never saw that episode. What was interesting was that her glasses were not props. If you look when the camera is behind her and over her left shoulder you can easily see that her left lens has a minus prescription in it. Also if you can tell that her glasses are fitted perfectly to her face, most of the time when someone is wearing prop glasses they really don't even fit all that well. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RK City 72</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2014, 01:06</p><p>Here is a TV episode that shows a sexy blonde, played by Caren Kaye, wearing wire rimmed aviator style glasses during many parts of the TV show Fantasy Island in the late 70s: </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkGjC4yCxV0" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkGjC4yCxV0</a> </p><p> </p><p>I always have had a thing for seeing young sexy blondes wearing aviator style glasses, and I think this could be one of the situations that could have left an impression on me in the past.  One of the names of the duo named episode was called "Double Your Pleasure," in which a man wins a trip to Fantasy Island to spend a weekend with two of the world's most beautiful women.  The women supposedly ended up being "twins"  so to speak.  One did not wear glasses but the other one did.  At the time and age that I was at the time, I was actually quietly surprised that one of the women who were considered among one of the world's most beautiful women in which someone would go to Fantasy Island for was an eyeglass wearer.  Though the makers of the story were probably just trying to differentiate between the "twins," played by the same actress, I guess episodes like this helped form the great impression on me throughout the years.  Anyway, I hope this YouTube viewing sticks around, as I had been wanting to view this again for some time. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2014, 05:06</p><p>Keeley Hawes looked amazing in Dr Who last night. Very sexy! The glasses were just props with no prescription. Shame that character was only in that episode, but at least she was in it a lot. Seeing that character with glasses was as good as seeing Amy Pond, the Dr's previous companion, wearing reading glasses. Again they were just props for the show but a few months after the actress who played Amy, Karen Gillan, had left the show she got real glasses! There are only a few photos of her wearing her real glasses and I can't tell what sort of prescription she has. I keep hoping that the Dr's current companion, Clara, will wear glasses at some point. I'm sure I've seen a photo of Jenna Coleman who plays her wearing glasses but I can't find it now. Maybe I dreamt it. </p><p>KL - I have seen Tipping the Velvet. I would have been too young to watch it when it was on but an older friend of ours who watched it when it was on has it on DVD and lent it to us a year or 2 ago. Keeley Hawes looked beautiful in that too. We did enjoy it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KL</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2014, 13:32</p><p>Carrie - my first thought when reading the name Keeley Hawes was "Tipping the velvet". Have you seen it? (No glasses, unfortunately, but interesting for other reasons.)  </p><p> </p><p>Pardon the trip off topic.</p><p></p><hr>

With her mousy gray stringy hair she simply looked old.  Contrast her with Diane Keaton who is of the same vintage but wears trendy plastic frames and there's a world of difference.  That's not necessarily saying that the right frames will make you look young, just saying that the wrong ones will make you look old.</p><p></p><hr>

She never wore clear ones, which you'd think she would during some of the other scenes requiring distance tasking but maybe the directors didn't think anyone would notice the scrip sunwear.</p><p></p><hr>

As you pointed out Slit it was really cute as her glasses came off watching her squint trying to see her reflection in the mirror just in front of her and then quickly giving up because her eyes are just too nearsighted to see herself without her glasses This was further proved when her makeup was complete and she had to get inches away fro the mirror so she could see how her makeup looked.  </p><p>If anyone hasn't viewed it it is well worth watching. I only hope she stays on the show till the bitter end. When she is gone I will also be gone.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Jul 2014, 17:00</p><p>No one has mentioned the new season of "Big Brother" It has kept my interest this season because of one of the cast members. A very attractive little blonde. her name is Nichol and she she is a nursing student. She wears her glasses full time and I have watched even the after hours show which airs for 2 hours every night and is live. So far she has not taken her glasses off even once. She does fiddle with them from time to time aand has to push them back up quite a bit because they slip down her nose. but she never goes so far as to remove them. Last night they showed some pictures of her back in college and in one she appears to be at a dance and the other she is wearing a basketball jersey and seems to be playing basketball in the pictures she isn't wearing glasses so most likely she was wearing contacts. Now her glasses are far from weak. She appears to be in the area of -3.50 to -4.00. </p><p>There was another girl on the show that only wore her glasses part of the time during competions, but she lost and was evicted from the house. There is another girl on the show that also wears her glasses full time but she is not of my liking. Her prescription seems somewhat weaker than Nichol's glasses.     </p><p></p><hr>

I know you didn't ask but the first one was made by "Tura" and they were very well made. The entire frame was made of aluminum. I am sure I misspelled that, but anyway that frame would last forever. It was a very light weight frame. The only problem I ever saw with them was that they were painted in either a copper color or silver color and after a while the paint tended to wear off. Both the first one and second one I came across quite often in the donation boxes back in the 70's. I held on to a good number of the ones that were in very good condition and some years later when an optician friend ask me about vintage glasses I pulled them out and when I showed them to her she really wanted one so she could make them up in her prescription. She had a difficult time picking which one she wanted and finally decided on the frame your referring to. They looked great on her and she often wore them at work even though her manager probably wasn't very happy about. She told me they were the most comfortable glasses she had ever wore. </p><p></p><hr>

There have been quite a few pictures of her wearing glasses over the past few years but not many that were as closeup as these pictures. Interesting that she seems to wear glasses quite often when she is out and about but from what I can tell her glasses show only a very slight cut-in, meaning her prescription doesn't appear to be much over -1.25 yo maybe -1.75?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2014, 16:06</p><p>Last Monday on Days of our Lives, both Jordan and Sami were wearing glasses.   Very rare to see 2 characters wearing glasses on the same day.   Chloe wore glasses when she was in her teens.  Adult Chloe does not wear glasses.  Chloe appears off and on.  Jordan is definitely a full time glasses wearer.   Sami is once in a blue moon.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2014, 14:31</p><p>Over the years "Days of Our Lives" female stars have been seen quite often wearing glasses. Quite few years ago a very attractive young woman played the role of "Cloe" She was in glasses full time then not sure why she suddenly didn't wear glasses anymore. At the same time a young actress played the daughter I think her real name was Zooey something. But in her case she only rarely appeared wearing glasses. But it was clear that when she did it almost had to be a result of a contact problem and of course those shows don't take time off. Then the role of "Sammi" who is still with the show and she too seems to wear glasses at will. I had lost interest in the show some time ago and only from comments in here i have tried to catch more shows. I have to admit the very attractive young woman playing "Jordan" has peeked my interest From as best I can tell she wears glasses full time on the show and they certainly appear to be her own prescription as well.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2014, 09:51</p><p>It's really great that FINALLY after all these years the people that put these shows on TV have figured out that in real life many people wear glasses so it made so little sense that you rarely ever saw anyone of the main cast wearing glasses. So much more realistic to see someone like Sophia Bush wearing glasses on her show and no doubt most likely her own glasses in her own prescription. Now that the door has been opened I don't see them ever going back. There will probably be more and more shows with the actresses wearing glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Jan 2014, 17:56</p><p>There was a post of Emma doing a radio talk show not that long ago, of course no real idea when the interview was done, but  it wasn't that long ago that it was posted. She was wearing glasses but they were much weaker than the glasses she is wearing in these pictures. In that interview she even took her lasses off to look at something on a monitor a few feet away.  </p><p>Could she have been wearing contacts and she wearing a mild prescription fro reading and in order to see distance better that was why she took off her glasses? It is very clear her glasses are strong enough in these pictures that there is no way she could see a small monitor several feet away without them. She is still quite young, so it could be just like any other young person her eyes are just changing at a rather fast pace? I would guess that her glasses in these pictures look to be at least -7.00. A lot of cut-in. </p><p></p><hr>

She started off the episode in - I'm assuming - contacts and then switched to glasses, and then it was on and off again. Big black frames which looked good on her, but a little too big on her face, at least in my opinion! Anyway, just thought I'd let you know in case you missed it! </p><p> </p><p>Also, I know this may not be the right thread as she is a sports personality, but it was on TV so I'm hoping this is enough of a grey area that people won't complain! :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>EJE42</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2014, 18:00</p><p>The blonde DOOL character that wore glasses part time was Sami.  This is from a while back.   She has not worn glasses for a long time. </p><p> </p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JFcYr-m_6U</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2014, 14:20</p><p>By the way watched an episode last night of "Liv and Maddie" on the Disney Channel. The idea of the show is that Liv and Maddie are identical twins except that Maddie wears glasses full time and Liv doesn't wear glasses. both roles are played by Dove Cameron a very pretty 18 year old in real life. Anyway unlike many shows they don't try and make the Maddie character look ugly but make her oddly enough more of a sporty girl that is the captian of her high school basketball teem. The other girl is much more of a girly girl type.  </p><p>Anyway in this episode the girls need to switch places after they both go for their driver's license and Liv passes but Maddie fails. Sees she has a problem with making left turns. Anyway Liv, the sister that doesn't need glasses, is in the car with the instructor and Liv is in the driver's seat pretending to be her sister. the instructor says to her "Aren't you forgetting something?" She says "Oh yes" and pulls out some lip gloss. The instructor says "No I mean it says here your required to wear glasses" She replies "oh yes, how could I forget?" and pulls out her sisters glasses and puts them on. She quietly comments "OMG" as she struggles to see with them and drives off hitting all kinds of objects along the way.  </p><p>The show will air again tonigt here in the states.  </p><p>Disney Studios don't seem to have any problem with some of there you stars wearing glasses in their roles.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2014, 14:03</p><p>Minus5 </p><p>The other day at the gym one of the overhead TV's had "Days of Our Lives" on and i couldn't hear what was being said and even though the treadmill I was on has TV mounted on it somehow I didn't feel comfortable turning to that station in case someone saw me watching a soap. You know not too manly. Anyway the next few days i watched from home and your right she is very attractive and i agree looking through her right lens from behind her there did seem to be a slight minification of the wall with the pasliy print on it. So her glasses are likely her own glasses and she has w very weak prescription because she is nearsighted.  </p><p>I haven't seen the show enough. Do they have her character wearing glasses full time? I remember many years ago there was a young lady on there and if I recall her character was Cloeie, she had dark hair and wore glasses full time and then oddly after a long while she suddenly didn't wear glasses anymore so her character must have gotten contacts as well as in real life maybe. I soon lost interest in the show. I know during the time i was watching that young lady there was 2 other blond girls on the show and every once in a while they would wear glasses, but usually just for that day. The younger one was a daughter on the show and her real last name was Storm and I only saw her wearing glasses once but there was no doubt that they were her real glasses because you could tell they were pretty strong looking minus glasses. There wasn't any mention of why she was wearing glasses written into the show so my guess is she had a problem with her lenses and had no choice but to wear her glasses to do her role. The other girl was a little bit older and she is still on the show and she did wear her glasses more often on the show. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2014, 12:15</p><p>Its very interesting that there are so many sightings of actresses wearing glasses at airports. I assume it is because if they normally wear contacts the very dry air on a plane dries out their contacts so they know it is just a better choice to wear their glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

Those glasses suit her so well. Her sunglasses (prescription sunglasses?) look like they are the same or very similar frame.

For God's sake the girl is only 23 how much makeup should a girl that age really need? She should save the makeup for when she is much, much older and she may really need it.  </p><p>It would seem that Kirsten must need her glasses nearly all the time since she seems to be wearing glasses most of the time when she is out and about. </p><p></p><hr>

I even once googled her looking for pictures of her wearing glasses and I was only able to find a picture of her as a child wearing glasses. Her glasses appear to have decent prescription in them so I assume she must have been wearing contacts when in the public. </p><p></p><hr>

They almost had it with "Legally Blonde" aa few years ago but only had her wear glasses very briefly.

I have not seen the movie but then does she keep her glasses on throughout the movie as well?  </p><p>I remember well that she needed glasses back in her Charlie's Angles days, and there was even one episode where she actually wore her glasses nearly the whole show. It made me wonder if she may have been having some trouble with her contacts as her wearing glasses was not needed as part of the show.  </p><p>I seem to recall an article, i think it was her that as she was going around to try and get acting jobs her mother had to keep reminding her to take off her glasses.

<p><b>s</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2013, 12:47</p><p>Last night I watched "The Middle" on ABC It's a sitcom about a family. The episode last night was called "The Kiss" About midway through the show the mom and dad were staying in someone else's home and the dad was trying to figure out how to turn the TV on and couldn't figure out which remote to use. His wife played by Patricia Heaton came in the room and sat down and asked why he wasn't watching TV and he told her he couldn't figure out which remote to use and even which button to push. She said "all you need is a fresh set of eyes" and promptly put on a nice pair of small plastic frame glasses. As she was getting the right remote she started reading the manual on how to use the remotes her husband snatched her glasses off her face and started hitting buttons again. He asked her about something in the manual and she responded that she couldn't see it without her glasses. Anyway this exchange went back and forth for several minutes until she took her glasses turned them around so they could both look through a lens each and she told him he should get his own glasses.  </p><p>As a side note several weeks ago the cast was making the rounds of many of the morning talk shows promoting the airing of the 100th show. The girl that play the teen daughter on the show was along and she was wearing very real glasses at each of the shows they hit. On the show she doesn't wear glasses but her eyes sure look like she is wearing contacts. The funny thing is she looked really super attractive when she was making the rounds that day, but on the show she appears t be much younger and even though she doesn't wear glasses she wears very noticeable braces on her teeth. When she was making the rounds she didn't have any braces and like I side she looked a bit older and super attractive. </p><p></p><hr>

I recall there was some discussion about this here before, but I was rather taken with Robin Mary Paris when I watched the film again. Everyone else seemed to be in plano lenses, whereas I guess these were her own RX glasses. I'm hoping for a comeback of aviator frames like those she was rearing. Sunglasses seem to be leading the way in just that direction, so maybe it won't be too long now.</p><p></p><hr>

Your so right, it was indeed her. i wonder if she ever got around to putting her own rx in them oor if she just left them as they were.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2013, 01:24</p><p>aviator -00- </p><p>Woody Allen has always had a thing about his actresses wearing glasses and even his wife's. "Annie Hall" as well as "Scoop" starring Scarlett Johanson were several that quickly come to mind and i am sure there were others. In real when he married Mia Farrow she wasn't wearing glasses but not long after they married she sudden;y became a full time glasses wearer and not only was she wearing glasses but they were in a style that Woody seemed to like very much like the ones wore in "Scoop" Also I don't recall the name of another actress in one of his films but she was thrilled becasue Woody gifted her with a apir of his own glasses which she admitted she wore regularly and hadn't bothered getting the prescription changed in them. She only comented how thrilled she was to get them. Little doubt that he has a fetish about women wearing glasses.  </p><p>Maybe we should invite him to join "Eyescene" Who knows he could be here under a fake name and we don't even know it. There is something to think about??? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2013, 10:44</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>"The Chew" is an ABC show.  Carla Hall wears glasses all the time, several different pairs, including white cat's-eyes.  The Food Network has notable bodies such as Emeril Lagasse, Ina Garten, and the klutz Giada who cut her finger slicing a roll the other day.  She should have worn her glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2013, 10:36</p><p>Melyssa </p><p> </p><p>Are you referring to "The Chew"? I have never really watched it but it comes on right after another show I do watch. The blond girl on there I thought is the wife of some doctor that also has a TV show? Is that the same young lady were talking about? I do admit to noticing her because she is very attractive but she was not wearing glasses. But it seems the young lady pictured wearing glasses that cut her finger may have just started wearing glasses, More likely she has been wearing contacts and she had an issue causing her to wear her glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2013, 07:45</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>The Food Network is a regular cable TV station, just like Animal Planet, ESPN, Lifetime, CNN, etc.  If you ever see a woman on the channel wearing drop-temples while making a fabulous spaghetti with oil and garlic, that is I.  That is, unless someone there sees this post first.  :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2013, 23:20</p><p>Is the "Food network" a show that is on in the UK? I don't think i have seen that station here in the states, but then again I don't often go looking for the food shows anyway. But if she on one of them then I may have to take up cooking, at least if she is going to be wearing glasses most of the time. lol</p><p></p><hr>

She was on the Today show explaining how she cut her finger on live TV and they showed a brief clip from that show and she was wearing glasses.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2013, 09:24</p><p>Lu2cri </p><p>It really seems that many of the shows are now not afraid to have their actors wear glasses more and more. Shows like The Middle and Modern Family both have characters that wear glasses full time on their shows. And the Disney show "Liv and Maddie" is yet another show where Maddie wears glasses full time. In an upcoming episode I think tonight or tomorrow she will be playing dodge ball with her sister (really her because she plays both Liv and Maddie), and she be wearing sport glasses to protect her eyes, so they really try and make a point that she can't see very well without her glasses. By the way if you haven't seen the show her character isn't cast as being a geek or nerd at all but more just a about a real girl that is in high school and is into sports but is still very attractive all the while.   </p><p>I think the popularity of glasses has made a big change in glasses being more excepted on camera.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2013, 22:44</p><p>Happened to catch a movie that came out back in 2010. It was mentioned at the time it was released but it was such a good movie and for once featured the leading actress wearing her glasses most of the time throughout the movie. The movie is "Chain Letter" and it actress was Nikki Reed. The nicest part is that it was very clear her glasses had very real lenses with a nice minus prescription, no doubt her real prescription.  </p><p>If you haven't seen t yet be sure to check it out as the movie is actually pretty good as well. </p><p>Another new reallity show has also hit the airwaves. Something called "Big Tips Texas" it's on MTV and is about the lives of a bunch of girls working at a sports bar in Texas and the going ons of the girls. One of the girls wears glasses nearly all the time except when they are going swimming.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Willy</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2013, 09:00</p><p>I was catching up on Modern Family and Claire (Julie Bowen) had a line in an episode before the Gloria needing glasses episode that perked my attention.  Claire went to work at her father's business and said she brought "a pair of glasses in case I want to read something or look smart."  The direct meaning of the line would seem to indicate a need for reading glasses, though the phrasing "a pair of glasses" rather than "my glasses" seemed odd.  And if they wanted Claire to debut glasses with a grudging nod to their necessity, the line would play better as "in case I want to look smart -- or read something." </p><p> </p><p>Later, Claire is seen entering data from a spread sheet into a computer without glasses, so the line was probably just a filler, but perhaps Claire will try on Gloria's glasses in a future epiosde....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2013, 07:35</p><p>Some time ago I mentioned that a woman named Terri Gerber would be shown on Match Game '76 around October.  She wore huge brown drop-temples, with an amazing resemblance to a Diplomat frame called Joanne (if not actually the frame itself), a frame I purchased in 1984 and still wear.  Terri may be on today (between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. EDT), if not tomorrow or the next day, as the gravelly-voiced grandmother who was her opponent made her first appearance on yesterday's broadcast. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;21 Oct 2013, 08:13</p><p>Seeing Valerie Bertinelli in her glasses on Iron Chef recalled her earlier role in "Touched by an Angel" (I think that's the title).  She played a younger angel who interacted with "humans" and wore glasses pretty much 100% of the time in that role. Looked very similar to what I saw on Iron Chef. </p><p>On the new Robin Williams (et al) comedy, Ann Heche appears as a news anchor and she was wearing glasses (around the office, but not on the air) in the recent episode.  </p><p>Finally, Ariel Winter, who plays the middle daughter in the comedy Modern Family, has new frames, more stylish and attractive imho, as this season begins.  Her character who also wears the glasses nearly 100% of the time, is the smart and solid one (v. the ditzy and sexy older sister character). </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2013, 20:12</p><p>Just came across a new Disney show. Well to be honest it has been on since mid July, but I don't watch Disney too much. But I happened to catch a preview of this show and made a point to watch it. It's called "Liv and Maddie" and it stars a young lady by the name of Dove Cameron. She actually plays both leading ladies. It's about twin sisters, one has just come home after starring in a TV series for the past 4 years out in Hollywood but it recently aired its last show. So she is more of a princess type. The other sister is every bit attractive but more down to earth. She is more into sports and is the star player on her basketball team. But unlike her sister she wears glasses full time and unlike so many shows where the glasses soon come off, not so in this show. I watched 4 of the episodes back to back and she kept her glasses on through each show. In the pilot the 2 girls are in their bedroom and Maddie (the glasses wearer) is getting dressed for homecoming and she asks her sister Liv which glasses looks best on her but she does so without taking off her glasses. Then in another episode Maddie's parents are trying to figure out a good punishment for her and consider several including grounding and taking her phone away and even consider taking her glasses away. In the end they decide to not let her play in an upcoming basketball game. </p><p>The glasses have lenses in them but so far they haven't had a real close up of her to be able to tell if the glasses have a prescription. Her glasses are not the "hipster" style but rather ordinary. But it's nice not making her a nerd girl for once.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Neil</b>&nbsp;10 Oct 2013, 01:40</p><p>Not exactly a real-life event, but tonight's Modern Family episode featured a side plot about Sofia Vergara's character Gloria being in denial about needing glasses. Scenes featured her moving any reading or other close-up material far out into the distance, but still making mistakes. I wonder if any of this is based on real life.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Oct 2013, 11:30</p><p>gwgs </p><p> </p><p>I agree with you. They seem to be basing the idea that Miss Stone's glasses were fake and not needed because she didn't wear them while on Jimmy Kinnel's show. Of course that is a crazy way to assume she doesn't really need glasses. She could of course switched to contacts at the studio, and just because she wears glasses doesn't mean she needs them so bad that she couldn't sit 3 feet away from Kimmel and see just fine without them. I saw the show and she didn't have to read anything or look at a teleprompter so even if she wears glasses full time she would be able to do that without them. I think her prescription is real but likely on the weak side. After all the woman is 55 so it would be more surprising if she didn't need glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2013, 05:25</p><p>I think Kristen's character might wear glasses in the film. She wears large dark framed glasses in real life and they make her look her age and maybe a little older (and rather sexy!). My similar glasses have the opposite effect on me which is why I got new ones. It's not fair. I was quite fond of my large black ones but it was time for a change. </p><p>Kristen is still sexy without her glasses but with them oh my god she is just so hot.

Since I only saw it the one time when it first aired I didn't notice at that time that the lenses in her glasses had a real prescription.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2013, 12:23</p><p>I asked this question before and never got a reply. So I will ask again and hope someone may be of help. </p><p>Back in the late 60's or early 70's there was a private detective show on TV that was called "Peter Gunn" one of the episodes I think it was called "Calendar Girl" or "Miss February" not sure which. Anyway it was about a model, and she was Miss February, she witnessed a murder but she was badly nearsighted and didn't have her glasses on at the moment so her vision was too blurred to make out what the murder looked like. Of course the murder had no idea that she couldn't see him clear enough to ever recognize him so he was after her to kill her.  </p><p>Anyone remember seeing this show or have any idea how to track down a copy of it now?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2013, 12:11</p><p>I think she (Jenny McCarthy) pretty much wears glasses full time. She may take them off for a few brief moments, but they aren't off for long before she has them back on. makes me really wonder what her prescription is? I also saw the show where she had forgotten her glasses and the first thing Barbra commented was asking Jenny where her glasses were. Interesting that she seemed very comfortable wearing Barbra's glasses throughout the rest of the show. Since I am pretty sure Barbra's glasses are a plus prescription Jenny must wear plus as well only she needs them for distance as well as close up now. it's interesting because the cabs of her her prescription appears very weak at best. </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2013, 22:57</p><p>Interesting...I always though Jennie was nearsighted...borrowing Barbara's reading glasses wouldn't help much???</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2013, 08:56</p><p>Thanks for the Kaley and McCarthy caps.  Kaley doesn't look too happy, wonder what's up with that. </p><p>I think Jenny McCarthy is very attractive: shapely, sassy, blonde and bespectacled. And it looks like she'll be wearing glasses most of the time. Even, last Tuesday, she began the show bare-eyed and in the first minute, Barbara Walters offered McCarthy her own glasses as Jenny explained she'd forgotten her spex. She took and wore Barbara's glasses for the rest of the show. </p><p>Wonder if we'll see an eyewear wardrobe on McCarthy or the same spex each day?  Gayle King of the CBS Morning show must have quite an extensive collection of frames and as wears a wide variety on those days she isn't bare-eyed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2013, 06:40</p><p>Sometime in the next few weeks, there will be two Match Game '76 episodes on GSN (Game Show Network) featuring contestant Terri Gerber, who wore extremely large brown drop-temples.  When I first saw the show, I wanted frames like hers, and -- Viola! -- 8 years later I got them, and they are still part of my vast collection today.  The frame is called Joanne, of the late Diplomat brand.   </p><p> </p><p>While I do not know the exact date(s) of Terri's forthcoming appearances, I do know that the champion at the time was an old woman with metal frame glasses, very short white hair, and a voice like the late wrestler Freddie Blassie ("You pencil-necked geeks!").  So for those of you who get the channel GSN, be on the alert for Terri's appearances.</p><p></p><hr>

Interesting thing about her glasses isn't the frame style (although I agree that these look very nice) but the lenses. </p><p> </p><p>When she first appeared on The Closer, she was wearing a much higher plus, probably a +1.25 or higher and it's expected she was wearing a progressive add as she's pushing 60 years old.  But these new ones are plano or close to it for distance and haven't been able to discern an add which would be possible given the plano top and the number of closeups. </p><p> </p><p>This raises possibilities: refractive or cataract surgery, multi-focal or monovision contact lenses with plano lenses in frames to continue her character's glasses wearing persona, and possibly some other options.  Anybody else got any ideas?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;21 Aug 2013, 09:48</p><p>Lv2c4i - I have seen photos of Christina Applegate wearing glasses before. Many years ago there were photos floating around of her wearing round metal glasses which I think were black rimmed. There were also some vidcaps of her wearing black heavy framed glasses - where they are now I don't know!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2013, 18:26</p><p>Lv2c4i </p><p>I have seen Christine Applegate several time wearing glasses. Most of the time he was wearing a rimless style which looked nice on her. If you go back in here you will find some of her wearing those glasses. </p><p> </p><p>i did notice the dark haired girl on "Big Brother" wearing glasses the other week. but is there others that i have missed. Usually each year there are several that wear glasses, but mainly when they aren't wearing their contacts is my best guess. since they don't ever wear glasses full time.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2013, 18:17</p><p>Just watched a rebroadcast of TLC's "Who Do You Think You Are?" featuring Christina Applegate.  Since much of the show features the "star du jour" reading genealogical records, many end up wearing glasses for parts of the show. So, it was with Christina Applegate.  She wore a handsome pair of stylish dark framed glasses for much of the show though I never recall seeing her in spex before. I think the episode is available online so perhaps someone will eventually post some caps. </p><p>Also, on the U.S. version of Big Brother, most of the women contestants have worn their glasses off and on throughout the season.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Slit</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2013, 01:21</p><p>Thanks for Jen Aniston photos. </p><p> </p><p>In the below video I post she plays nicely with glasses, at one time removing them and putting them back soon as she had to focus on up close activity (picking some magnetic rings in a water bottle). </p><p> </p><p>I guessed an rx of about +2 and add of about +1. From the way the light bends inside the lens at one moment she waves hair you can see it is progressive bifocals. </p><p> </p><p>She is one of my favourites based on looks, charisma, wit and also the acting talent (not an extreme art movie talent, but does well in almost all the roles). </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hEyPCSji9w" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hEyPCSji9w</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2013, 12:38</p><p>Lv2's comments on Sarah Jessica Parker remind me of something I've been meaning to post about her hit Sex And The City.  Throughout the 6 year run of that show all of the actresses except her character Carrie wore glasses at some point.  Charlotte wore hers quite often in her role as art gallery manager, towards the end Samantha wore them to read as her character was well over 40, and Miranda wore them twice: once while poring over papers while buying a home and the other time when she got lasik. She commented to the doctor presurgery that this would be the first time in her life that she'd seen clearly w/o glasses or CL's.  But her frames were disappointing as they were round gold metal ones with no lenses in them at all, or possibly plano with damn good AR. </p><p> </p><p>But!  In the first movie, fairly early on, she is sitting up in bed with Mr. Big and has a book, she goes to read a passage to him and reaches over and takes his off of him and puts them on, he said "you really need to get glasses" and she smirks and says "no I don't, I have yours".  That jibes, as the movie was a few years after the TV series ended so she would have been over 40.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2013, 06:34</p><p>Inasmuch as she is "at that age" (+/-), I'd wondered when we might be treated to seeing Sarah Jessica Parker wearing glasses. So, it was a treat to see the caps of her posted earlier. So now, who will be next to display their spexy side?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2013, 11:23</p><p>Brigit Mendler actually got glasses in July of 2012. In the recent photos of her arriving in London wearing glasses they seem to be same ones she got last July. So by now she should have gotten a reminder card suggesting that it has been a year since her last eye exam and wanting her to book an appointment soon. So it will be interesting to see if she may soon be sporting some new glasses. Lets hope she doesn't opt for contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2013, 19:18</p><p>Carrie &amp; Unknown </p><p> </p><p>The newest pictures of Brigit Mendler arriving at the London airport shows here wearing the same glasses that she seemed to refer to as her first glasses some 6 months before like the "unknown" person pointed out.  </p><p>That was probably about the time I saw a picture in here somewhere of her wearing glasses.  </p><p>Disney is not good about letting any of their young stars wear glasses in their respective shows. I remember when Debbie Ryan now of the show "Jessie" was first cast on The Suite Life on Deck" she was being interviewed about getting the part and she was wearing glasses during the whole interview. Sadly she has yet to ever be seen wearing glasses on either of those shows or a made for TV movie that she starred in.  </p><p>The bad part about that is there are so many youngsters that are in their early teens that watch those shows that it would be a good thing if they actually allowed some these young stars to wear glasses to encourage their fans to wear their glasses. They make it appear that every teen has perfect eyesight and we all know that isn't true.     </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

She looked pretty in the photo on the Radio 1 website but she wasn't wearing glasses, so I was very pleased to find she does wear glasses. Judging by the photos that came up (with and without glasses) that were actually of her she is much prettier than Amanda Bynes. Amanda used to be pretty but something has happened and her face seems puffed up now.</p><p></p><hr>

Just a pity she doesn't get to wear them in her films. She was a bit daft sticking her fingers up to the cameras but she is entitled to some privacy and she probably wasn't expecting to be photographed. Maybe that's what she looks like when she gets up in the morning - I'd love to find out first hand! (Don't worry, she's on my "Allowed" list. Gemma is still the love of my life) </p><p>I haven't been to the coffee shop for a while. Yes, the server is lovely especially with Danielle's spare glasses on but I can't keep going in there to keep checking her out. She has a girlfriend who is also a friend of mine and I have my own lovely girlfriend. I know there's no harm in looking (the server checks out all her customers, the attractive ones anyway - male and female. Open minded, bisexual, pan-sexual, whatever you want to call her), but too much looking is not good! There is mutual attraction between all 4 of us but that's it.</p><p></p><hr>

The actress who plays her, Jenna Louise Coleman, is gorgeous! Sadly, I don't think she wears glasses in real life. Clara reminds me of me a bit - petite and feisty! The previous companion, Amy Pond, got glasses in her last or almost last episode. Again the actress was gorgeous (Karen Gillan). The glasses were props and she doesn't wear glasses in real life. </p><p>Oh yeah - girls watch Dr Who as well as boys!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 May 2013, 18:52</p><p>Carrie </p><p> </p><p>If you do a background check on Hilary Duff you will find that around the same time as her "Lizzy McGuire" show was wrapping up she commented that she always wanted glasses but had never gotten around to getting them. It wasn't long after that comment that she started showing up wearing glasses. My first thought was that they were probably plano (non-prescription) but there are so many pictures of her wearing glasses that I am now pretty sure they are prescription. Since most of the pictures of her are either with her just arriving someplace or getting into her car it would tend to indicate that she must be a little nearsighted. </p><p>I also agree that she is looking mighty fine these days. Her body seems to have recovered well from having a baby.   </p><p></p><hr>

It could be she was just standing at a table that wasn't hers and the glasses on the table belong to some else.  </p><p>The fact that she is only 28 has little to do with it these days since progressives and bifocals are not that uncommon anymore for even early 20's.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eyestein</b>&nbsp;25 Apr 2013, 06:51</p><p>lentifan </p><p> </p><p>Scores of photos of that girl?! </p><p> </p><p>I think I have seen no more than about five. Please tell me where I can find the others</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;24 Apr 2013, 15:07</p><p>It's interesting that Eyestein and I both find the girl very attractive and Clare doesn't.  Also interesting, I think, is that of the scores of photos of this girl, many of which are obviously posed, there is not one of her without her glasses.  This seems to me to indicate either: </p><p>A   She herself, or the photographer (spouse/partner/ friend/family member?) thinks she looks better wearing her glasses, or </p><p>B   They think that, since she probably is never seemn without her glasses, any picture of her bare-eyed would be so untypical, so unrepresentative,  as to be almost a different person.  </p><p> </p><p>On reflection, I've moved off-topic here.  I should post this to 'Seen on the Web', perhaps</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eyestein</b>&nbsp;24 Apr 2013, 04:43</p><p>Carrie and lentifan </p><p> </p><p>I don't know that girl's name but she is one of my favorites. She looks so sweet and feminine. Her glasses and her obviously poor vision tend to enchance her appeal. That appeal arises from classical male protective instincts. Her poor eyesight arouses something like compassion in a sensitive male but it is not exactly compassion. It's an emotion linked with all the stuff associated with sex appeal. I guess only those who feel it can understand it. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2013, 19:17</p><p>Lentifan </p><p>She's sweet and has a great figure but I don't find her attractive. Don't get me wrong, I don't think she's ugly. Just not my type. I also feel sorry for as she obviously has extremely bad vision.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2013, 18:30</p><p>I suppose what a young lady like you fancies in a woman, Carrie, is bound to be different from what a middle-aged (he said, optimistically) male fancies.  But I always have the impression that Hollywood stars wear these big black frames to look deliberately unglamorous in the hope of escaping unnoticed.  And even if they are spotted, the glasses are so dominant that they have the effect of making the wearers all look the same, so perhaps they hope not to be recognised if people can't tell one star from another. </p><p>In my opinion, this girl beats them all hands down.  Her glasses are real and lovely. </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://public.fotki.com/Russian-GWG/10---gwg-from-web/24-gwgs-from-the-we/web-gwg-2013-1-0452.html#media" target="_blank">http://public.fotki.com/Russian-GWG/10---gwg-from-web/24-gwgs-from-the-we/web-gwg-2013-1-0452.html#media</a> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://public.fotki.com/Russian-GWG/10---gwg-from-web/24-gwgs-from-the-we/web-gwg-2013-1-0443.html" target="_blank">http://public.fotki.com/Russian-GWG/10---gwg-from-web/24-gwgs-from-the-we/web-gwg-2013-1-0443.html</a> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://public.fotki.com/Russian-GWG/10---gwg-from-web/24-gwgs-from-the-we/web-gwg-2013-1-0447.html#media" target="_blank">http://public.fotki.com/Russian-GWG/10---gwg-from-web/24-gwgs-from-the-we/web-gwg-2013-1-0447.html#media</a> </p><p>I'd be interested to know if you find her attractive.</p><p></p><hr>

I really would like to see that style make a return as they really have a glam look about them. The shape and even that little sparkle at the outside top are appealing. I well remember that style and I even kept several when I came across some of them years ago in the donation boxes. But after a few years I brought them out and as soon as I showed them to my female optician friends they quickly begged me for them. Now I would bet I would get even more reaction. </p><p></p><hr>

It just saves a lot of time to not have lenses in the glasses, but of course we all would rather see real lenses any day of the week and would not have a problem with reflections and the such. lol </p><p> </p><p>By the way that is what makes the work that Crystal Veil does so impressive. His shoots are with real glasses in various powers and most if not all of them don't have the aid of AR coating. This is why he is truly the master of his craft. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2013, 16:24</p><p>In the back of my mind I'm telling myself I shouldn't fancy Kim Kardashian as she seems to be one of those "celebrities" that nobody is quite sure why they are famous. Unfortunately the rest of my brain isn't listening. I like her body and I like her in glasses (obviously!) although the glasses are a little bit masculine, in my opinion. Showing that much cleavage will certainly get you noticed! I don't like to boast but when it comes to boobs I am far from flat chested! Maybe I should get some really flashy glasses so certain people will be distracted by them instead of my chest! (OK, I don't mind too much getting checked out by a hot girl especially if she's wearing glasses! Why do think I've stayed with Gemma for 2 years? Ha ha!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2013, 11:49</p><p>Given her younger sister wear glasses, as well as her mother and father (both only seen occassionly wearing them, maybe cl wearers), then I would've thought there is a hint of a prescription, there is definitely some refraction in a couple of those photos, and in one of them her eyes definitely seem enlarged by her glasses (which would suggest a + prescription).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2013, 10:43</p><p>Fanboy </p><p> </p><p>I see the picture your referring to and it does appear to show some distortion in her right lens, it could indicate some prescription or just be due to a camera angle.  </p><p>With those girls it is hard to tell what is real and what isn't. Remember there is no better way to market a product your trying to sell than to wear the product yourself.  </p><p>The possibilities are all over the place for now. It is possible that she didn't bother to wait for her eyes to be stable when she had the lasik done and her eyes have continued to change. If she was over corrected too much she may now need readers. And being pregnant could have caused her eyes to change as well? And of course thay could just be plano lenses she is wearing. Take your pick. </p><p></p><hr>

I'm not quite sure, but I think an asian/indian king or prince is also involved in the plot. It's not "The King &amp; I" or "Anna and the King". Grateful for your help.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2013, 13:22</p><p>Yoyo </p><p> </p><p>I think you are right on both counts. I think Renee for some reason didn't have her reading glasses with her. Kinda crazy considering she had to know she was a presenter.  </p><p>And I would think that Rebecca Miller is most likely nearsighted since she wasn't reading anything but probably needed them to see what was happening on stage. But I agree they were nice looking glasses and they looked great on her. She may even be into full time wear as her glasses looked to have at least a moderate prescription. </p><p>Sadly I kinda thought there might be more of the stars sporting glasses last night. Too bad it seems they still cling to there contacts for formal wear.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2013, 13:09</p><p>Also, I think Rebecca Miller (Daniel Day-Lewis' wife) appears to be nearsighted? They looked like minus lenses to me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2013, 13:07</p><p>I wasn't sure if Renee Zellweger was having vision issues or just tipsy, but she appeared to be squinting like crazy the whole time. It did occur to my wife and I that maybe she didn't bring her glasses with her, as it seemed like she couldn't read the card either time it was opened. </p><p> </p><p>She did seem to read the teleprompter okay, so maybe she just needs reading glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2013, 11:29</p><p>Rebecca Miller, wife of Daniel Day-Lewis was sporting some nice frames at the Academy Awards last night. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe a low plus with some cylinder?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2013, 10:54</p><p>Did anyone happen to take notice that when Ricard Gere, Renee Zelleweiger, Queen Latifta and Katherine Zita Jones were presenting at the Oscars last night that Mr. Gere read off the nonamees and he handed the envelope to Rennee to read the winner she took it and looked a bit embarrised and handed to Queen to read the winners name. Then there was a second thing she was asked to read and this time she handed it to Katherine. I can't believe the winners name is so small that she couldn't read it without glasses, but that is sure how it looked.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2013, 10:29</p><p>Not sure how many recall that several years ago just after she ended her "Lizzy McGuire Show" she was spotted wearing glasses for the first time and she posted on "Facebook" that she always wanted glasses but she had never got around to getting them. At first I thought they were probably just plano but since then there have been numerous pictures posted of her wearing glasses. Like these 2 pictures she is going to or coming from a workout so not something you would expect if they were just for fashion she would bother with. Plus many of the pictures are og her getting out of or into her car so I assume she may be slightly near sighted and needs them. She really fancies very big bold frames as she has been pictured wearing several different ones but they all are big. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2013, 05:26</p><p>AP... you're living in a fantasy world.  What more proof do you need that she is not Emily Tarver?  She even posts showing her name is Cathy Pickles but you refuse to believe it. </p><p> </p><p>Just because two women look similar does not mean a thing.  Do all women with glasses look the same to you?  You are realllllly stretching things with the comic strip analogy considering neither of the actresses Emily Tarver nor Cathy Pickles have anything to do comics. </p><p> </p><p>But I'm willing to entertain your comedy.  Please show me another reference where "Emily Tarver" posted as Cathy Pickles to support this insane theory of yours. </p><p> </p><p>Wake up and smell the coffee, the Havertys woman IS Cathy Pickles.  She is NOT Emily Tarver. </p><p> </p><p>BTW, sorry I ruined your world with my mistake of writing Christina instead of Cathy.  FYI, they are both actresses, so it wasn't that egregious. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>A. P.</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2013, 19:09</p><p>Hello "Q'. </p><p>   Let me try to explain this to you, not that it's really all that earthshakingly important.  The TV commercial actress IS Emily Tarver.  You stated in your previous post that the actress was "Christina Pickles".  Yes, there is an actress named Christina Pickles, but she's obviously not the lady in the commercials.  Now you have posted that the actress is "Cathy Pickles".  If you look at the youtube page belonging to Cathy Pickles, you'll see that the posts there look suspiciously like the page belongs to Emily Tarver herself.  She was just defending herself when she posted on the youtube comments section as "Cathy Pickles". </p><p>By the way, both "Cathy" and Pickles" are names of popular comic strips.  Get it? </p><p>Emily Tarver is a talented lady.  Let's all just enjoy her work, OK?  Thanks.   A. P.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2013, 18:03</p><p>Actually AP is wrong.  if you look in the comments on the Haverty's speed date commercial on Youtube from about five months ago, you can see where Cathy Pickles herself responded to criticism of her acting skills in the commercial.  So we have clear proof the Haverty's girl is not Emily Tarver, it is Cathy Pickles. </p><p> </p><p>Check it out yourself:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9AKIQXa_kc" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9AKIQXa_kc</a></p><p></p><hr>

Noomi is a beautiful Scandinavian woman and you can still see that despite the heavy make up she wears as Lisbeth.

The young bride in the wedding video is a different Emily Tarver, not the actress/comedian/singer Emily. </p><p>   II. The actress in the TV commercials for Havertys and other companies is indeed Emily Tarver, NOT Christina Pickles. </p><p>   I hope this brings the Emily Tarver issue all into focus. </p><p>Thanks and I hope everyone now sees things my way!  </p><p>A.P.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Q</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2013, 14:40</p><p>i think some people here might be confusing emily tarver with the havertys actress named christina pickles.  not the same person even though they look similar.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2013, 14:12</p><p>A.P. </p><p> </p><p>Yeah thanks for linking those. I was thinking more of the commercials she did for that insurance company that her glasses looked a little stronger, but seeing these I was wrong. by the way I had not seen that video short of her lunch date. That was pretty funny. I kinda like that style of glasses on her as well.    </p><p>I noticed that there was a nice video of her wedding back in April of 2012. She didn't wear her glasses but I was surprised as how young she is still. Her husband looks very young. She did make a beautiful bride even if she didn't wear her glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>A. P.</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2013, 13:01</p><p>Soundman:  I believe Emily's rx may be mostly for astigmatism with a little myopia correction also.  Here are two seldom seen older videos featuring Emily,  circa 2009, wearing some nice semi-rimless glasses. </p><p>    TV commercial: </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5wncCU_Ork" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5wncCU_Ork</a> </p><p> </p><p>    comedy video short: </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dqBveGlBPA" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dqBveGlBPA</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2013, 11:26</p><p>Didn't Emily Tarver's glasses used to be a bit stronger than the ones shes wearing in this short? I even thought maybe this short was maybe from a few years ago but it appears to be very new. In fact for the first few minutes they look like they don't even have any lenses in them but she must have the best AR coating on them? Its only in last few minutes that you can tell there is a little bit of cut-in.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2012, 10:21</p><p>Lucas </p><p>Having gone through all her photos and zooming on each of them I could not detect any type of rx in her left lens, but in the very last photo there does seem to be some distortion in her right lens but that could even be due to the angle of the photo. But it should be noted that Casper Smart, her boy toy and her body gaurd are both wearing sunglasses and in several photos J-Lo is actually squinting a bit due to the bright sunshine. Yet for some reason she chose to wear regular glasses. My guess is they do have a slight prescription in them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2012, 17:56</p><p>Soundmanpt - I agree Kristen looks better when she isn't covered in heavy makeup. She looks stunning in the jeans and t-shirt she's wearing in the photo. I don't go for women that wear loads of makeup - they're probably trying to hide something. I love her current glasses. Bigish and the colour goes really well with her hair colour. She was a bit stupid having an affair - but she's only human. She just happens to be famous. Lots of non famous people have affairs (myself included - I started seeing Gemma when I was still sort of going out with my last boyfriend). I used to really fancy Lyndsey Lohan in the photos of her when she had hair similar to Kristen's and wore some really nice dark wire framed glasses. But now I've gone off her a bit and like you I think Kristen is actually much more attractive. I can't compare their acting skills as I've never seen Lyndsey Lohan acting and I've only seen one of the Twilight films when it was on tv a while ago (can't remember which one or what happened in it as I couldn't really get into it. I just remember thinking how sexy Kristen was. Robert Pattinson does nothing for me so I don't really get what all the fuss is about him. He's not bad looking but there are other actors in Twilight that are equally good looking) </p><p>Has Kristen ever done a film wearing her glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Dec 2012, 18:32</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Maybe its just me, but most of the pictures I have seen of her she seems to look so much better casual with little or no makeup. I really think for someone only 22 she doesn't need so much makeup and so hard around her eyes all the time.  </p><p>You know I am not much of a fan of hers so I laughed when she got caught cheating on her long time bf but really after you think about it if she were just an unknown no one would care and in the real world a lot of that does happen, but when your a star as big as she is it has to be hundreds times worse. She had to feel somewhat like a slut to many millions of people and probably was even called that by her fans. She is still miles ahead of Lindsey Lohan  </p><p>I wouldn't be a bit surprised if her sunglasses aren't prescription as well? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Euro Traveller</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2012, 04:26</p><p>Carrie - I think Helen has already been given the boot so you won't be seeing her pretty bespectacled face on 'I'm a celebrity'. She is undoubtedly very attractive but from glancing at the front pages of British tabloids over the last couple of weeks I can't help feeling that the whole thing is a cleverly orchestrated stunt to relaunch her career after Coronation Street. I'm sorry to say I don't think we'll be seeing her glasses anytime soon. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2012, 12:19</p><p>Euro Traveller - I was thinking the same thing. I even thought about watching it because I fancy Helen Flanagan and she might wear her glasses and also there was a good chance of her wearing a bikini! But even that is not enough to get me to watch it (I've seen bits but not a whole episode). I can rely on the 'net to provide pictures of Helen in a bikini in the jungle (sooo jealous of her gorgeous body!). </p><p>Some people say that they are not far from the nearest town and the hotel where Ant &amp; Dec stay is even closer. </p><p>I don't really know who any of the "celebrities" are as I don't like soaps or reality tv. There's also a fat old man who apparently played Doctor Who in the 1980s, long before I was born. That is the only person I have any respect for as anyone who has played DW is amazing. </p><p>If you like mature (over 60) people with glasses there is the old Doctor Who and a very large lady (absolutely no idea who she is or why she's famous). </p><p>It is strange that Helen hasn't worn her glasses in the jungle yet. There would have been photos of her wearing them. Maybe (hopefully) she will wear them before she is evicted or even wins the show. I'm still not going to watch it. I'll wait for photos and videos to appear on the 'net.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Euro Traveller</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2012, 04:29</p><p>I'm not a fan of shows like 'I'm a celebrity get me out of here' but I thought it was curious that Helen Flanagan who is quite myopic (a Google images search will reveal recent pics from the Spectacle Wearer of the Year Awards at which she was about the only 'celeb' wearing real glasses)  was never once seen wearing her glasses  given the conditions that the contestants apparently have to endure. </p><p> </p><p>I would have thought it quite unlikely that anyone would be able to tolerate wearing 'night and day' lenses in those conditions. </p><p> </p><p>Call me a cynic but I suspect that life may have been rather more comfortable for the 'celebs' than the TV edits suggest...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2012, 14:42</p><p>Soundmanpt - She has lost a bit of weight around her face since the photos were taken. She looks very pretty on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing but her thighs are still a little big. As I said, I like curvy girls but she is the upper limit for my taste. She has been a kids tv star for about 10 years and is about to start acting in stuff for adults (as in shows that are not kids tv rather than porn!). She's only 23 so I've grown up with her. She's quite good at dancing too. I haven't seen her wearing glasses on Strictly Come Dancing but then I don't see it that much and I can't be bothered to record it or watch it on the BBC iPlayer especially now that Victoria Pendleton is out (she didn't wear her glasses either)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2012, 12:30</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Really hard to tell if there is any prescription or not in her glasses. But if there is any it is very very slight. But I do like that style of glasses on her. She is on the slightly bigger body size and that style of glasses goes well for her. She isn't bad looking now but she would be really pretty if she were to loose just a few pounds. She is mostly big in her legs and thighs. her waist isn't that big really. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2012, 12:14</p><p>Alice Eve is stunning! That photo of her from 2011 - Wow, so sexy!

My girlfriend is a bit less curvy than Dani Harmer. </p><p>That isn't a great photo of Dani and she probably would look better with less make-up and a different hairstyle. The glasses are ok.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2012, 12:54</p><p>Lucas </p><p>It could be she may have had it done before her vision was completely stable. So her vision could still be changing slightly. Also it is not unusual for most to have some regression form when they first get it done. that is why most everyone comes out with vision of 20/15 and even 20/10. After a couple of years the vision drops to 20/20. Also some experience some issues with problems with night vision as well. So her glasses could have a very slight prescription in them, but really I am surprised that we haven't seen more of the Kardashian girls wearing glasses since they recently came out with their own line of eyewear.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2012, 17:38</p><p>In the photo of Kim Kardashian I think she is holding her prescription glasses as she tries on new frames which would explain the strange reflection on the ones she's wearing. If you look through the lens of the glasses she's holding it seems to be a shrunken image of the background. </p><p>If you click on the left or right of the photo there are photos of other celebrities wearing glasses, most of them have already been seen by regular users of Eyescene I expect. I was happy to see a photo of the very sexy Kristen Stewart with glasses (actually I'm happy to see any photo of her with or without glasses!) - it's the same photo that I linked to last week and that's not a flattering one but it's still her in glasses! </p><p>The people that have left comments on that E online website are quite nasty.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2012, 20:40</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I haven't seen all of her films so I can't say for sure but since nothing has turned up in here of any films where she is wearing glasses I would say the answer is no. Aside from right after Transformers first came out and they were doing a story about the movie and the male star (Shi) and Megan were in an editing room and she was wearing her glasses then. In fact that was the first time I saw her wearing glasses. Later on more and more stills came out with her wearing glasses.  </p><p>Because of the number of sighting of her wearing glasses away from work I would have to guess that when she isn't wearing glasses she most likely wears contacts. Add to that even if she only started wearing glasses when Transformers  came out that has been about 5 or 6 years ago so she is young enough that she likely has had several increases over that time as well.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2012, 20:20</p><p>Does Megan Fox wear her real glasses in any of her films? I was watching Transformers 2 with my girlfriend, Gemma, on tv earlier and while we both enjoyed seeing Megan Fox (the only reason we watched it!) I would have loved to see her wearing her glasses. </p><p>There are loads of photos of Megan wearing her glasses which I do look at sometimes. </p><p>Does anyone know if she normally wears contacts?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2012, 15:23</p><p>Lucas </p><p> </p><p>It's hard to say but they look to be much stronger than her previous ones but it is true these glasses are also much bigger as well. Looking at her eyes with the picture "zoomed" her eyes look very large. Of course they are plus glasses but I recall her saying she got her first glasses when she started doing "Wizards of Waverly Place" No doubt she has had several increases since then. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2012, 11:34</p><p>Carrie </p><p>We all know the rule about genes. So it is highly likely that if Pippa needs glasses her sister Kate likely does so as well. </p><p>It took a long time for these pictures of Pippa wearing glasses to appear so it may take as long if ever to find any of Kate wearing glasses. It will be interesting to see now if Pippa will be seen much more often wearing glasses or if this was just a rare moment. It of course could be she had a problem with contacts that left her no choice but to wear her glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2012, 18:26</p><p>Pippa is very beautiful, although the first picture is not a good one! I have a feeling (or maybe just wishful thinking) that her slightly more famous sister also wears glasses.  </p><p>It could have been a photo I saw of Kate when it first became public she was going out with Prince William and she was wearing glasses in that. A photo of Kate wearing glasses would be amazing to see now. She is naturally very beautiful and slightly better looking than Pippa. Kate is easily the best looking female member of the British Royal Family.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2012, 17:56</p><p>FaNaTiKX </p><p> </p><p>Great find! I wondered some time ago if Pippa wore glasses or not and it is very clear that she does. Very curious that this is the first sighting of her in glasses with all the attention she receives constantly. So can we assume that she has been wearing contacts before this or do we think that she is new to glasses? Most of the pictures show dark circle under her eyes which quite often someone wearing glasses for the first time has or is from just too much night life and lack of sleep? It will be interesting to see if more pictures start to surface of her wearing glasses. They do suit her very well. But then again she could wear almost anything and look striking.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jan</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2012, 04:03</p><p>Hi Adalle, </p><p>the first scene ending with the removal of her eyewear, which is very brief, is in S02E06 (about 24 Min in). The second time, which i was refering to, because she wore no RX, is in S02E09 after 6 min. Your Welcome :-) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2012, 01:03</p><p>Hello Jan, can you tell me in which episode her guy takes off her glasses, if you remember? By the way she appears in S02e02 for the first time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jan</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2012, 06:23</p><p>I really like Alexandra Hamkalo, on "Komisarz Rex". It's a pretty bad polish TV-Show, which was mentioned here before (BTW thanks for that). The interesting thing about the show from my perspective is that she wears 2 different frames, which are exactly the same. She got both of them once in the -5 area and once without any prescription. So in some scenes, e.g. when her guy takes of her glasses she wears her contacts and the props, not to be too helpless in front of the camera, i guess. No "regular viewer" would recognize that, but we do, don`t we? She appears in Season 2 Episode 1 for the first time, so don`t bother checking out the first season. </p><p>I don`t understand a word of polish, but i watch her scenes every week anyways, because she is sooo sweet.  </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.teletydzien.pl/gwiazdy/news-to-jest-czas-oli-hamkalo,nId,635733" target="_blank">http://www.teletydzien.pl/gwiazdy/news-to-jest-czas-oli-hamkalo,nId,635733</a> </p><p> </p><p>Downloadable episodes via DDL (own risk): </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://peb.pl/obyczajowo-sensacyjne/1267295-komisarz-alex-2012-sezon-2-webrip.html" target="_blank">http://peb.pl/obyczajowo-sensacyjne/1267295-komisarz-alex-2012-sezon-2-webrip.html</a> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2012, 12:29</p><p>I'm pretty sure that's a bifocal, the line is too straight and level on both sides to be a reflection.  You're never too young for a multifocal of any kind, I got my first ones at age 27 for aesthenopia caused by a slight accomodative lag. And she's on 3 months away from 41 and presbyopia even a few days past 40 is not uncommon. I could read fine with out them at age 27, but it was just a little more comfortable to have them on for near point tasking and have immediately clear distance vision when looking up even though the distance scrip was very slight.  And seg height is definitely a personal thing, I like them high and have no difficulty looking over them and they're great for computer use.  On the other hand, my prescription sunwear has a very low seg as about all I use it for is to see a road map etc.   </p><p> </p><p>Also, remember, actresses are using glasses of all kinds to make a statement, maybe she's on to something and it will hopefully catch on!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2012, 11:00</p><p>Slit I see what your seeing but I also think that if they are the add is positioned very high up and I would think make it very hard for her to see distances very well. If she would be looking in the distance with them she would have to look down so her eyes could focus through the the smallish top segment. But being close to 40 doesn't mean a thing as there are many even younger now that require bifocals. But it would seem she would have gone for the much less noticeable progressives. But at any rate they still look very nice on her.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>matthewson</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2012, 05:37</p><p>@slit: sure looks like it, but i think that's more of a reflection. for one, the bifocal line is really way up the lens, secondly Drea DiMatteo is what, about 40 - so a bit young for lined bifocals in public and in general, isn't she?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;04 Oct 2012, 01:24</p><p>Clare </p><p>In answer to your question, just as Melyssa said the bigger the glasses the thicker the lenses will appear but more so in your short (near) sighted. Even on your own glasses when you clean them you should be able to feel that your lenses are thicker on the outer edges than they are in the center. In fact in the center is the thinnest part of your lenses. So the bigger the lens is the thicker it will continue to get on the outside edges. All this of course is based on the same type of lens. This is why most often as the prescription gets stronger the opticians will try and have you select a smaller frame or they will suggest a hi index lens option. Your prescription is not nearly any problem for any type frame you may want. Now for Melyssa she has stated that she has a rather large face so that of course means she needs a bigger frame size. But in her case she happens to love big glasses and has no problem with her lenses looking thick as -9.00 with standard lenses will have plenty of edge thickness.</p><p></p><hr>

One of my colleagues wears the large geek style glasses with an Rx of -1.25 sphere and -1.25 cyl, they look quite strong. Maybe she also has CR39 lenses?

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2012, 01:59</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Being in the states I have no idea who the guy was doing the interview but he didn't seem to pick up her glasses comments at all. If she had not mentioned her glasses not once but twice he may not have wanted to ask hr anything about her glasses since it was on radio and no one could see her. But if she was not wanting her fans to know she was wearing glasses she wouldn't have commented on them. As soon as she made the first comment he should have right away asked her if the glasses was a new look for her? I have no doubt that she would have answered as to if they were indeed new or if she has been a long time contact wearer and maybe had a problem which wouldn't allow her to wear contacts. But as I already said she certainly appears to be new to glasses. She acted like they just weren't fitting right but yet they looked to be sitting perfectly in place before she adjusted them and didn't change at all after she adjusted them. But she was constantly adjusting them.  </p><p>We all seem to agree that her glasses appear to be a light plus prescription. I really thin what we are seeing is her adjusting to her glasses. Carrie you should know best because your first glasses were only a weak plus prescription and the easiest thing for you was adjusting to seeing close up with your new glasses. Emma seemed to have no trouble seeing her phone during the interview, which means her eyes have already gotten used to seeing close with them. But like you her eyes are still adjusting for  distance vision, so even though it probably isn't clear and sharp she can still see with them. But to look at a small laptop at a medium distance for now it is probably easier to see clearly without her glasses for now. She didn't look to have any trouble seeing the laptop without her glasses from what I could tell. But overall she must be getting comfortable with wearing them as he wasted no time in putting them back on.         </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2012, 09:09</p><p>Could it be her prescription is a little more complicated than just a simple plus and needs to adjust for close-up, like computer screens? It's clear from the photo that her prescription does have plus in it but if that's all it was she wouldn't have needed to take her glasses off to see the screen at Radio 1. Of course she could be getting used to her glasses and is putting up with the slight blur for general distance vision but can't see fine detail at a distance yet so she might have found that the screen was just a little too far from her to see the photo clearly. </p><p>I think she actually looks better with glasses on. Without them she still looks like Hermione (spelling?) aged about 13. With her glasses she looks older than she actually is. </p><p>I get the impression she is very happy with her glasses and they are probably very new. She mentions them twice during her chat with Grimmy. It's like she was thinking to herself "He hasn't mentioned my glasses yet, how annoying! I'll have to somehow casually mention them!" </p><p>By the way, can all of you non-British understand Grimmy's accent? Some British people have trouble understanding him! ;-) The previous Breakfast Show host, Chris Moyles, was also from Northern England but his accent wasn't so strong. Grimmy's ok but I miss Moyles  - I grew up from a little girl to a young woman listening to his show (over 8 years!).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2012, 11:32</p><p>It is a bit curious that she takes her glasses off not once but even a 2nd time while looking at the laptop a short distance away. The only thought I have is that her glasses have a plus prescription and her eyes have yet to adjust to them for distance. But the screen wasn't far enough away that it should have caused her any problem seeing it with her glasses. But she didn't appear to have any trouble seeing the laptop without her glasses. But if notice she seems very fidgity with her glasses and is constantly adjusting them throughout the interview. This is very common for someone that is wearing glasses for the first time as they get used to them. At first I thought maybe it was because of the headset, but I don't think that was it. her glasses hadn't slipped at all so more like she isn't yet used to wearing them. At any rate her prescription looks very weak and I appears to be plus and maybe some astigmatism as well but that is hard to tell.</p><p></p><hr>

Took them off in a "moment of passion" and they didn't return. Various old photos shown of her wearing them were shown during the show, so hopefully they'll return.  </p><p> </p><p>She looks great with or without, but obviously better with:)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2012, 16:55</p><p>It looks like a there is some magnification in her right lens for sure. It also shows up in the 2nd picture from the bottom in the BBC photos. But none the less I would say she is wearing a very weak plus prescription. Most likely her first glasses and she may have only gotten them recently. Maybe at some point she will be asked about her glasses and she will reply. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2012, 10:10</p><p>Yes and the third picture also shows a slight glare in Kaley's left lens. With the new and improved AR coatings it can sometimes be very hard to see lens in pictures and even harder when the prescription is a very weak one which I think is the case here. YoYo is probably correct that her glasses a weak minus. Those other pictures she was wearing glasses at a basketball game where her glasses would make things a little clearer and sharper for her. </p><p>Maybe someone will get our suggestions to the producers of the show. I think there was several good story lines that appeared in here that could be used. I doubt they would ever consider making her wear glasses full time as they already have 2 females that wear glasses most of the time. I think they want her to carry on as shall we say the normal one that is not brainy and a bit on the hot side. They could make her a part time wearer for like when she is all the time driving the guys here and there. She could now be wearing glasses for those occassions. One thing would be great in introducing her as a glasses wearer would be what so many come in saying all the time. The getting and wearing glasses for the first time around friends, family and co-workers. This would be easy to relate for everyone that remembers getting glasses for the first time. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2012, 06:53</p><p>The Kaley posts are great.  I, too, wonder about an episode that would get her into glasses.  Many sitcoms have had such an episode and Penny and the nerds gives a perfect context for it.  I believe she very briefly wore glasses in one brief scene of her previous show, 8 Simple Rules. </p><p>And, the choice of spex in these pics show the evolution of style from the "original" nerd spex (which she wore in some caps from a basketball game) to a more tailored look. Her spex are still fairly large and "outfront", but much more attractive and indeed stylish, imho.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2012, 12:00</p><p>kisal </p><p>It would be nice if the producers would come up with story line for Kaley (Penny) to wear glasses too. But I guess they like the idea of the other 2 having characters where glasses fit better. The odd thing is in many of the shows it is very clear that the blond that wears glasses there is no lenses in her frame. The other actress has been on several other shows and she actually wears glasses in real life so they let her wear her own glasses for the show.  </p><p>I even have a good story kine for them to use. Penny needs a job and she wants to get hired where the guys work so the other girls convince her she needs to look more like she would fit in so they do a makeover on her which of course would include glasses. Kind of an opposite version seen so often where the girl starts out wearing glasses and soon is converted over by letting the hair down and contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

(I bet she's great in bed, too) I hope her boyfriend appreciates how lucky he is and he should be aware there loads of men (and quite a lot of women including me) who would gladly take his place even for 1 night! In most cases seeing someone with a cigarette is a big put off for me but she is just so desirable I could ignore it. My girlfriend, Gemma, doesn't smoke and neither do I. An ex boyfriend of mine started smoking a couple of months into our relationship. I wouldn't let him near me if I smelt cigarettes and I warned him several times I'd dump him if he didn't stop smoking. He didn't think I would do it so he carried on smoking. So I dumped him!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Aug 2012, 11:50</p><p>I have never shot a gun so I don't know for sure, but it is common for people doing target practice to wear some eye protection. But they usually look more like wrap-around goggles. The glasses he is wearing looks much more like prescription glasses and it would make sense that if she doesn't have perfect vision she probably would need to either wear contacts or prescription glasses to see the target clearly. I also read the same where her mother was feuding with her about not wearing her glasses like she should. Anyway I am not sure if they would consider regular prescription glasses okay for shooting or if they need to be made of safety glass?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Icantsee</b>&nbsp;27 Aug 2012, 09:17</p><p>Sadly I think just for safety although she has said in the past that she needs glasses.

<p><b>Chloë</b>&nbsp;16 Jul 2012, 05:46</p><p>And of course, I'm still surprised that glasses and braces are still being used as signifiers of female ugliness in cinematographic media. The problem here really is the relativity of aesthetic judgements, which means viewers would not recognize that someone is presented as 'ugly' if she was just 'plain' because 'plain' is mostly 'normal' and for some probably better than that. And drawing upon obvious 'disfigurement' (however problematic this term might be) as a sign of 'ugliness' will probably be seen as discriminatory (and I guess I agree). Besides, permanent features do not offer the chance of the aesthetic transformation often found in stereotypical plots. So glasses and braces indicate that a person is supposed to be 'ugly' even though probably viewers will not see them as 'ugly' themselves, especially considering the variety of glasses being used and being seen as attractive these days and considering the fact that there are so many (adult) people wearing braces today. </p><p> </p><p>OK, a short excursion into the semiotics of 'ugliness' in filmic representations.</p><p></p><hr>

When first seeing "Strangers on a train" on television in the early 1960's I was disappointed by the unsympathetic role played by Laura Elliott and even more so by her short role. Even as a schoolboy, I thought that Hitchcock did not do justice to "real" GWG. I clearly remember another moment of disappointment when seeing Patricia Hitchcock wearing glasses with plano lenses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2012, 19:05</p><p>I think I saw the same interview Soundman did, she said Hitchcock insisted she wear the real high minus glasses and she had an awful time doing it.  They did play a significant part in the movie when she got murdered, no question from all the scenes they were a high minus with a plano front.  Even when I was young couldn't accomodate enough to handle that.</p><p></p><hr>

The one that worked at the record shop gave an interview a few years later and she referred to the glasses she wore and said that they were so strong she could hardly see anything through them and in one scene she actually had to hold onto the counter as she walked because she couldn't see. Mr Hitchcock seemed to have a thing for his leading ladies wearing glasses as there were several movies that had the female lead actress wearing glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

Carrie's husband is a pro hockey player and she said something in an article that her vision isn't too good and she didn't wear glasses and she couldn't see the puck. Not long after that article she was at a graduation if I recall and she was wearing glasses. But they were a nice simple wire frame, but no doubt she has likely gotten others since then.

I was amazed how quickly she  put a contact lens in. I suppose with years of practice it's easy to put them in. When I wear the contacts my friend gave me (her prescription is very close to mine) it takes me ages to put them in. I sometimes wonder why I bother and I realise why my friend gave up wearing them and wears her glasses instead. I do find them useful when I go to the gym as my glasses slip down my nose. I love my glasses so I don't wear the contacts much. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2012, 19:19</p><p>Oh dear, not again! </p><p> </p><p>John S, on a point of fact, the lady you refer to in your last paragraph was not subjected to 'vicious attacks'.  You are exaggerating. </p><p>This website exists for people who have a common interest.  They will naturally use terminology and vocabulary which they understand.  Any new users will soon pick it up.  If you wish to change the vocabulary we use, then good luck to you, but don't be surprised if you are unsuccessful.  The terms used don't bother me.  However,your continued use of 'cutesey' is beginning to irritate me, but I'm sure I'll get over it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John S</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2012, 18:55</p><p>Val, I think you are taking this too personally.  I don't think you have anything but the kindest feelings for people, and I feel the same.   </p><p> </p><p>I'm just referring to the activities of the "clique" as opposed to the rest of us here.  They're the only ones using the cutesy words and have basically driven everyone else out turning Eyescene into an insider club with their very own vocabulary and secret handshakes.  Not exactly a welcoming atmosphere.  I'll go on record and say I'm willing to bet that almost every woman who suddenly appears needing glasses and posting here in the past couple of years has been a fake by one of the regular "clique." </p><p> </p><p>If we want to be accepted legitimately, then we should act legitimate and use real clinical terms.  Throwing around cutesy little words just makes us sound like this is all a school ground trading "guess what I saw" stories, and coming up with impersonal names to label people.  Not unlike Fatso, tubby, boney, etc that we hear in school. </p><p> </p><p>I forgot who the woman was who mentioned something about the same several people posting over and over again here, but I do remember the vicious attacks against her for calling things as she seen them.  I see it too.  But while I guess she was scared away, I'm sticking around to see if we can  broaden our appeal, bring us into mainstream.  Somethings got to be wrong if we're still hidden after fifteen years and no one even bothers to come here except fake accounts.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John S</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2012, 08:24</p><p>Yoyo, hate to tell you but Mr. Anon who doesn't like plussie isn't me.  So it looks like you are up against more than one person here.  But I do agree with their assessment about plussie being a bit childish and cutesy too. </p><p> </p><p>John S, don't forget that "obsessive" is definitely a psychological term, perhaps even more so than fetish.  At least the term "fetish" focuses on the sexual aspects of the issue, while "obsessive" sounds like every breath you take has to be about glasses and you think 24/7 about nothing else.  Is that what you really mean by an OOO?  So take that into consideration.   </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Val</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2012, 07:20</p><p>John S, I am sorry but it's not my dictionary. I only reposted a link from Bobby's site.

You may be correct. But there are people who like "optic obsessive" maybe because they don't like to be considered fetishists.

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2012, 14:28</p><p>John S, </p><p> </p><p>Every community of people (even a small one like Eye Scene) will build up some number of terms that are well understood amongst themselves but not to anyone else. If you want to be a part of said community, it's useful to educate yourself about the terminology. </p><p> </p><p>However, if you're just here to criticize the community and not be a part of it, then you will of course not want to learn.

And fetish is an abstract term where as obsessive is actually an adjective given a substantive meaning in this case. WTF is cutesy about it?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John S</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2012, 07:21</p><p>Val, no offense but I think you give those cutesy little words a bit credence than they deserve.  Even building yourself a little dictionary too?  Honestly, I've been here since 2002 and only seen the same five or less people use those words over the years, so the "we" is a lot smaller than you imagine it to be.  On the other hand, if you believe the regular "clique" that posts hourly here is Eyescene, then I understand where you are coming from. </p><p> </p><p>Since we are speaking in such wide generalities, I will say that many of "us" (the crowd outside the clique) prefer "glasses fetish" and words like this that have commonplace in the real world.  Sorry, but those other words sound like things you make up in a kindergarten recess.</p><p></p><hr>

It is a poll offering readers an opportunity to "vote" on whether they prefer the bare-eyed or the bespectacled look.  The pictures include both male and female stars. In many cases, the readers have chosen the glasses as their favorite of the two pix. Many are photos (and stars) we've seen wearing their glasses before, but some are new.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;19 May 2012, 08:06</p><p>Eliza Coupe featured on ABC's Happy Endings appeared recently wearing glasses. The frames show a typical stylistic evolution from the basic "nerd" frames that so many are wearing. Her frames are a bit more angular and more stylish imho. She looks very attractive in them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;19 May 2012, 06:27</p><p>Debra Messing is in the TV show SMASH (NBC, I think) and her character wears glasses regularly in that show, so that may be a source of pictures of her in glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;13 May 2012, 17:14</p><p>I think film and TV directors tend to prefer the plano lenses (or no lenses) because they don't have to deal with reflections from the lights. I know they have anti-reflective lenses these days, but real prescription lenses will still reflect something.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lucas</b>&nbsp;13 May 2012, 15:39</p><p>I still do not understand why actresses who wear glasses in real life end up wearing plano glasses in movies. Also, even more frustrating, in New Girl, Zoey Deschannels seems to wear glasses with no lenses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Val</b>&nbsp;13 May 2012, 15:07</p><p>These glasses seem to have plano lenses. I don't see any kind of distorsion through the lenses. But the frames suit her well. </p><p>As I recall Reese had a plus prescription, no more than +2 D. </p><p></p><hr>

I enjoyed watching the whole thing.  </p><p> </p><p>It so funny how Hollywood puts a scene in with someone, in this case Reese Witherspoon, wearing glasses for a 20 second time and then somehow that person never wears them again. In this movie she wore them coming into her office and giving the impression that she maybe needed them for driving as she soon took them off while looking at her computer. But after that she never ware them again for driving or seeing close up. I guess we are to assume she also wore contacts? But who knows?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2012, 22:23</p><p>chrisb </p><p>So far it seems they have left her alone about wearing her glasses when she wants. As you say one can only hope some executive doesn't decide she shouldn't wear glasses on the show. But since the cat, so to say, has been out of the bag and she has been seen more than once wearing glasses it would now seem pointless to change now. Maybe this will lead to other shows letting their stars wear glasses as well. Really it sends a positive message to the many teens and pre-teens that watch her show that you can be beautiful and wear glasses if you need them. Actually she deserves an award for being a role model to youngsters that need glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2012, 06:24</p><p>I'm sure this link has been posted before but I just wanted to remind everyone how hot Lindsay Lohan is with glasses on! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.tvshark.com/photos/?n=Lindsay+Lohan+Glasses" target="_blank">http://www.tvshark.com/photos/?n=Lindsay+Lohan+Glasses</a> </p><p>I've seen some more recent photos of her with bleached blond hair but I prefer the brunette look. The fact she is bi-sexual makes it even more exciting for me! I don't find her ex girlfriend (Samantha Ronson) at all attractive. Lindsay seems to be dating men again now but she could always go back to women. If she ever wanted a threesome with a couple of English girls me and my girlfriend would be very willing!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;16 Jan 2012, 16:48</p><p>I never watched the TV series Sex And The City originally because it was on HBO and I don't have that, but now it's on E! channel for free and is rerun a lot.  They also showed the movie based on the series this weekend, and I realized the movie completed the GWG episodes as now all 4 of the ladies have worn glasses at least once. </p><p> </p><p>Charlotte wears them quite often in the series, a very stylish small black rectangular frame and she looks great, but unfortunately they are plano. </p><p> </p><p>Miranda wore them in only one episode, just before she got lasik and she was delighted because she couldn't function without contacts (she said) and the episode in the series was a lighthearted look at lasik.  The frames were perfectly round gold metal, right out of the hippie 70's, but they too were plano. </p><p> </p><p>Samantha fessed up to being 45 years old, and after surviving breast cancer was asked to speak to a group of survivors and both practicing her speech and delivering it she was wearing black half eye readers.  Again, in the series. </p><p> </p><p>And rounding it out, but not until the movie, was the only one who'd never been seen in glasses, Carrie.  About 25 minutes in she brings a book of poetry to bed with Mr. Big who was now her husband, where he was reading with his glasses on.  As the movie is set 10 years later than the series and is about where the ladies were at that time, she would be in her mid to late 40's.  She gets in bed, reaches over and takes Mr. Big's black plastic men's frames (with a real plus rx)and puts them on to read.  He said "young lady, you need to get your own glasses" and she replied "no I don't I have yours". </p><p> </p><p>Any one of us would loved to have served as technical consultant to the series, we would have had all of them wearing real glasses...a lot!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2011, 11:39</p><p>Watching TV the other day I happened across the TV series "Victorious" starring Victoria Justice. It was their Christmas show and Victoria was doing something on her laptop and was again wearing glasses. They didn't have a closeup but I would bet they were her own real glasses. Someone put a link on here a month or so ago of her wearing the same glasses in another episode. Good that they are not afraid to let an already attractive young lady wear glasses. It does make sense more than 65 % of the population wears correction of some kind now. hats off to whoever is allowing her to be seen as a real person that wears glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2011, 11:32</p><p>Jan </p><p>I'm sure the reason they didn't want her to use her own real glasses was because they were much too cute. They were going for a dorky not attractive look and they probably only went into their prop room to find those glasses. Even though they spend millions to make a movie they didn't want to spend the money to have her real rx put into her glasses. We must remember that 99.9% of of the people seeing that movie would ever notice that her glasses were fakes. Her real glasses didn't appear to be very strong so she either did her scenes uncorrected or wore contacts. It seems that some of the few movies where a character wears glasses throughout they will sometimes spend the extra money to get the actors real rx made into the glasses to make it easier for her to do her scenes.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2011, 07:49</p><p>Last Monday two actresses had an interesting conversation about glasses--men in glasses.

Recently, she continued, he'd come home with glasses and she'd been all a-twitter saying she'd flirted like a schoolgirl. </p><p>Kelly Ripa quickly and emphatically agreed, saying her husband had recently gotten glasses and that she was finding him newly attractive as well. They both agreed that glasses made men very attractive. </p><p>Too bad they don't realize that that door "swings both ways" and so choose to wear their glasses more regularly.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2011, 13:56</p><p>That's right I do remember seeing something that her hometown is Philly. Does she indeed have a history of drinking and drugs? In all fairness I again watched the video and she really did seem to be having a hard time seeing the teleprompter. If she is smart she should claim that was the problem and even get some glasses and be seen wearing them when she is out and about for a while to back up her story. It may help save her acting career for now anyway.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2011, 09:56</p><p>This is not Kim Delaney's first, shall we say, "problem."  She is an embarrassment to my (our) birthplace, and she should get together with wrestling's Hardy brothers, because they would be three of a kind.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2011, 00:00</p><p>Did anyone happen to catch the speech that Kim Delaney was trying to give honoring Bob Gates for his service. It turned out to be real mess. She struggled withe reading from a teleprompter and many suggested she was drunk or on drugs, but in viewing the video it looks much more like she couldn't see the teleprompter and was very embarrised. If you watch you can see at several points she is straining hard to try and make out what it says. One real clear shot shows her right eye squinting to try and see it but with little luck. I am not defending her because drinking or drugs may have played a part as well. But I would fell bad for her if this ruins her acting career and it is only because she needed glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

Hanging from a chain around her neck was a pair of very large, pink, plastic square frames.  The metal frames had minus lenses, while the plastic frames had plus lenses.  When doing close work, which was the norm with patients, she wore both pairs, with the plastic glasses in front of the metal ones, saying that it was the only way she could see what she was doing with me (and others) properly, and that she could not afford bifocals, so this was her way of compensating.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2011, 11:43</p><p>Someone posted a picture of Charlize as a child and she indeed was wearing glasses. They were not but they surly weould have been prescription. These pictures did not give any close ups or any angles to see any distortion in her lenses. They could well be real with just a very mild rx.  </p><p>Not sure where the pictures were taken but if was at an airport and she had just got off of a flight it could be like so many others that fly find wearing contacts uncomfortable due to the dryness so she may have been forced to wear her glasses. If she does wear contacts it would make sense that even a weak rx would cause her to need her glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2011, 03:44</p><p>Smudgeur: </p><p>what I mean is that the glasses are real but Ornella don't actually need them in her real life, neither they fit her behaviour (the character is that of a strongly nearsighted woman, while glasses are mildly positive, I mean). In this sense I wrote they are not real.  </p><p>I'd have preferred a GOC actress wearing strong minus lenses when requested by the story and forced to play as a REAL shortsighted when not wearing them.  </p><p>I saw the whole movie years ago and there are several scenes of her having troubles to see or wearing glasses. I remember one in which she put on a pair of glasses that are not her own and actually see for the first time the face of the man she is dating with! It recalls the other great movie "How to marry a millionaire".</p><p></p><hr>

That show was on again yesterday, and the contestant who was champion had brown octagon frames on top of her head, probably  with plus lenses, because of the convex way they looked.  At no time did she wear the glasses, yet on Friday's show she didn't have them at all.  Naturally, the Game Show Network stopped the cycle abruptly returned to the 2/3/74 show next.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2011, 21:30</p><p>FaNaTiKX </p><p>It looks like the pictures without glasses were of her going in and coming out wearing glasses. If you look close you can see she is carrying the glasses case and what looks like maybe a box of contacts? If you zoom in to the 4th picture down her glasses appear to be a plus rx. The frames are Ray-Ban Wayfarers. They suit her well. I notice she has what looks like a bandaged left finger as well. I think she may have been picking up her glasses and contacts. Wonder if she is getting glasses for the first time? </p><p></p><hr>

The song has got to be the most erotic musical number I've seen in a very long time if not ever.  Priyanka's singing, dancing and teasing is so sexually suggestive, but she maintains such dignity and beauty (a sharp contrast to the slutty suggestiveness of so many music videos).  Oh, and those glasses, those glasses, those glasses which she wears with such confidence, are IMHO the most beautiful style possible for a young woman.  Pure heaven!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2010, 11:15</p><p>I have found watching "Ghost Hunters" more entertaining than ever. There are 2 attractive young ladies on the show and both wear glasses in most episodes. Last week they did a marathone of all the past shows up to the most recent. The one young lady Chris never wore glasses for the first season even when driving, but the second season she was wearing glasses full time. It could be she had contacts the first year or maybe got glasses during the break in the show? The other girl wears hers about 75% of the time, but always for seeing close and most of the time for distance as well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2010, 09:58</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>That episode, in the spring of 1995, was the one in which Al and Kelly made a "shoe-cumentary" called "Sheos."  There were 4 women (Vena being one of them) in bikinis in the shoe store in the latter part of the show while Al was filming them. (And the producers never called me to appear in it, probably because I wear glasses!  LOL) </p><p> </p><p>As for Kelly, she wore metal frames a couple of times when trying to appear intelligent or scientific. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Shenae's glasses have a little metallic detail over the bridge, Sandra Bullock's have added shape and color, and the very wide temples seem to also be appearing more and more. </p><p>And I find the embellished styles more attractive than the basic old style frames.

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2010, 07:07</p><p>2 weeks ago the new TV movie of Scooby Doo was released. A new actress, Hayley Kiyoko, plays Velma in this. There is only one scene where Velma drops her glasses and starts cleaning them thoroughly. In this scene I noticed the glasses must have been prescription. And so it is. It appears Hayley Kiyoko has a mild prescription and the producers decided she should wear real glasses instead of contacts over plano glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Here are two behind the scenes clips. In one she wears her real glasses. </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2zJRqKC1wc" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2zJRqKC1wc</a> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VTey8Ps884" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VTey8Ps884</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>pete</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2010, 11:38</p><p>I just saw a recent indie film called (UNTITLED) featuring the young attractive blonde Marley Shelton as a highbrow art gallery owner.  Her character wears a variety of glasses to help define her 'look'.  In one scene her lover (alone in her flat) is intrigued by a carousel-like display of her glasses- maybe a dozen pairs.  He picks up a pair and looks through the lenses only to discover that they are plano.  That aspect was a bit disappointing but I was intrigued that the wearing of glasses played a significant part in the film.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guido</b>&nbsp;01 Sep 2010, 07:07</p><p>Who is the actress seen in several commercials in about the last year or so, she wears glasses that appear to be weak minus?  One of the spots in which she appears is for a home improvement company (Lowes, Home Depot, etc.)where she is rehearsing in the car with her significant other, she's using a deep voice to prepare their tactics to get a good price on something.  Then they get into the store and the salesman offers them all the things they were prepared to request. I have seen her in other commercials, in one of which she wears some red glasses.  She's reasonably attractive but no knock out. I am just wondering if she is featured in any films or television shows and if she is bespectacled in those.</p><p></p><hr>

"What's that, sonny?"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2010, 08:49</p><p>Melyssa </p><p>Hey go easy on us Social Security people. I promise to leave you have all the big frames you want. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2010, 08:30</p><p>While the place I deal with sometimes gets large enough frames, it's still rare.  Every other optical place in my area has frames half the size (height, width, depth) of what would fit me comfortably.  And even if major actresses and TV newswomen were to start wearing large frames, leave it to the Social Security Set to buy up all of the good frames and make the younger women shy away from them, just like with the drop-temples in the 1980s.  Sure I would not wish for that to happen, but reality bites.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2010, 08:18</p><p>Daffy you are soooo right. I go into many optical shops each week and I have looked and asked about bigger style frames for women and at least here in the middle of the USA not one store carries anything like Miss Lucas is wearing. All seem to be rectangle frames. Even the younger women that work in the stores wish they would become available. </p><p>Yes and I think it is great that more and more TV and movie stars are being photographed wearing glasses. Not too many years ago stars would go out of their way to avoid being pictured wearing glasses. Seeing stars wearing glasses will make it cool for many young people to not be so shy about needing glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2010, 08:54</p><p>Emma - I think if someone finds a look that really suits them then it can make a huge difference.

<p><b>Emma</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2010, 06:08</p><p>Soundmanpt - with your posts to Hollie and Clare.........I think some people just aren't too comfortable wearing glasses.  Sometimes that's physically uncomfortable not just cosmetically.  Yes, contacts can get uncomfortable but glasses just don't feel right on some people and they can't get used to wearing them FT no matter how much they might want to. With me it's not liking the feeling of them on my face and also the sense that you're looking at the world through a window, being able to see the edge of the frames. It's just how it is, no matter how attractive find they glasses ;-) And that includes me, I'm no glasses hater lol!!  I think there's something going on with the desire to wear glasses v. not liking wearing glasses that makes the obsession stronger..........</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hollie</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2010, 13:47</p><p>I've been wearing lenses most of the time recently but doesn't mean I can't appreciate glasses- I think they look brilliant on some people but not on me sadly. Plus I broke my current glasses and am wearing an old pair- actually black plastic!- that I'm not as confident in. If I were to ever make the jump to wearing glasses most of the time, would have to find that amazing pair, much like cheryls I think! A girl at work has lovely brown and black plastic designer statement frames and suits them perfectly- she's not quite a full time wearer but enough of a prescription that they are usually on her face or desk at work rather than in her handbag.</p><p></p><hr>

When you have a minute go back and look at "Seen on the Web" find Crystal Veil  May 31  23:16 scroll down and you will see many glasses he has used on his models all from zenni. There is also a lot of vintage glasses as well. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2010, 20:43</p><p>Clare - Yes of course I agree with you. The thing to remember the easiest things to do to change ones looks is either adding glasses or taking them away. They are not likely to put glasses on someone that didn't wear glasses, but the other way makes more sense to them. Think about it, your a blonde with long hair and glasses. You would look different very quickly if they colored your hair to brown and cut it short with a different style and removed your glasses. People you work with may not recognize you. It is true that glasses do change ones look, it's just that I don't think they make anyone more or less attractive. These shows go for dramatic changes. I have seen a few of these shows where they actually did just upgrade the glasses on someone. But most of the time they do seem to go away rather quickly. </p><p>By the way I am surprised your on the same side of the fence as us guys that want you ladies to wear your glasses. I would have thought you would be the one leading the charge for them to rip those glasses off those ladies and stick them contacts in. How did that happen??? Are you feeling OK??? </p><p>Luv ya Clare!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2010, 12:54</p><p>Clare, </p><p> </p><p>Naturally I agree.  If it were up to me, these so-called makeover shows would be made over with everyone with less-than-stellar vision wearing glasses.  Of course, the women's frames would be big, bold, and beautiful plastic frames, 1980s-style.  :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2010, 11:57</p><p>Good to see attractive females like Cheryl wearing glasses, no matter what the strength. I'm always irked when the TV makeover shows (Gok's Fashion Fix last night was classic) always 'improve' someone's look by removing their glasses. I never know whether they just get them to go without them or if they convert them to contacts, whatever they do I wish they wouldn't - if they're a glasses wearer they should just get them to invest in a new style. Does anyone else agree?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2010, 02:23</p><p>Cheryl Cole was formerly in the Simon Cowell/ X Factor found pop group 'Girls Aloud', she then split to go on as a solo artist which she is currently enjoying great success with. She is also a mentor on tv's X Factor, and is almost as well known for putting up with s**mbag (now) ex husband Ashley Cole who plays for Arsenal - after he has cheated on her numerous times - she has filed for divorce in the last few days from him whilst he is away in South Africa with the mighty England at the World Cup. </p><p> </p><p>Phew!

<p><b>kisal</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2010, 18:37</p><p>Not really an "actress," since it's only a cartoon, but I just loved the scene in the movie "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" where the cute young woman _puts on_ her glasses for the first time and the man tells her something like "you were nice looking before, but nothing like the amazing way you look now."  And the character wears her glasses for the rest of the movie.   The woman is a newscaster and the anchor makes fun of the way she looks in glasses, but he's the one made out to be a buffoon for his attitude.  If only there were ever a live actress film with a similar scenario, it would be one for the ages...</p><p></p><hr>

All about the special live episode of EastEnders that was shown on BBC 1 earlier. Most of the Aftermath programme was live with some recorded interviews with cast and crew. 2 of the female cast were wearing glasses in their recorded interviews (have not seen either of them wear glasses before either in the show or in real life). One was 17 year old Melissa Suffield who plays Lucy Beale and the other was 32 year old Rita Simons who plays Roxy Mitchell. the programme can be seen again only in the UK via the BBC iPlayer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00qym8y/EastEnders_Live_The_Aftermath/" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00qym8y/EastEnders_Live_The_Aftermath/</a> </p><p>Melissa can be seen at 7mins 32secs.

There has been discussion here before about whether Allen is a gwg fan. Looking at the run-down of characters in 'Annie Hall' there is some evidence of this; whilst most of the girls in glasses appear with plano lenses, there is a notable exception close to the end of the film. This is Robin Mary Paris. There is a picture of her here, as seen in the film, but sadly it is only a very small image. Have a look at the film, and you'll see a lovely girl wearing large clear-plastic aviators, with a script of at least -3. </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://cineclap.free.fr/annie-hall/robin-mary-paris.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://cineclap.free.fr/%3Ffilm%3Dannie-hall%26page%3Dpersonnages&amp;usg=__Y69KSCvLxqkZObt_JqTEJK2qVuA=&amp;h=100&amp;w=100&amp;sz=3&amp;hl=en&amp;start=2&amp;um=1&amp;tbnid=bO6VSgl4IbrQZM:&amp;tbnh=82&amp;tbnw=82&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3D%2522robin%2Bmary%2Bparis%2522%26ndsp%3D20%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DN%26um%3D1" target="_blank">http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://cineclap.free.fr/annie-hall/robin-mary-paris.jpg&amp;imgrefurl;=http://cineclap.free.fr/%3Ffilm%3Dannie-hall%26page%3Dpersonnages&amp;usg;=__Y69KSCvLxqkZObt_JqTEJK2qVuA=&amp;h;=100&amp;w;=100&amp;sz;=3&amp;hl;=en&amp;start;=2&amp;um;=1&amp;tbnid;=bO6VSgl4IbrQZM:&amp;tbnh;=82&amp;tbnw;=82&amp;prev;=/images%3Fq%3D%2522robin%2Bmary%2Bparis%2522%26ndsp%3D20%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DN%26um%3D1</a> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2009, 00:48</p><p>Amy Adams also wears glasses throughout "Talladega Nights" (the car racing comedy with Will Ferrell) -- very fetching! Not sure if they had real Rx; they are weak minus if at all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>chrisb</b>&nbsp;25 Dec 2009, 15:36</p><p>Just watched night at the museum 2. The love interest is the actress Amy Adams playing a very sexy Amelia Earhart, with a very tight bum in jodphurs. At the end of film, the actress /character re-appears  as a visitor to the museum but this time with glasses that look like they have a real RX. A nice inversion of the  glasses/no glasses transition. </p><p> </p><p>In Amy Adams' previous film Julie and Julia she appears with 2 different frames for close work. IMDB has clips of these sections of the film. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe a GWG in real life? </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, Amy Adams bears a striking resemblance to my 20 year old Son's current GF so, I'm off for a cold shower.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;12 Dec 2009, 05:36</p><p>Thanks for the Kaley pictures. While I don't find the big nerd frames all that attractive, they do seem to be the fashion of the moment(shabby chic or something?). And any glasses, nerdy or not, are a nice treat. </p><p>   As far as her wearing spex on her show, the latest episode had her trying to learn some physics--an prime opportunity for using glasses in the storyline--and she was bare-eyed through it all. </p><p>    She did ,however, apparently have a brief bespectacled appearance on her previous show, though I never saw any caps of that.</p><p></p><hr>

Once the ad is closed out you can just click on the Enter of the opaque image and you can view it along with others. Also, sorry again, the first image you open will also open an Amature Sex Webcam ad. I just close these out and they usualy don't come back for the remainder of the visit.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>kisal</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2009, 05:50</p><p>Yesterday I went to see the new film "(Unitled)" </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.untitled-themovie.com/" target="_blank">http://www.untitled-themovie.com/</a> </p><p> </p><p>Beautiful actress Marley Shelton plays Madeleine Gray, the female lead, and she is bespectacled for &gt;90% of the film, while kissing, while starting to undress, while wearing the most incredibly sexy outfits.  She has a "glasses tree" in her apartment, and wears at least four different pairs at various times, all either black or white frames, constituting an important part of her "look".  Also the male lead (played by handsome Adam Goldberg also wears black-rimmed specs at times as do several minor characters. And it's a well-done film about art as well. I would HIGHLY recommend it! </p><p> </p><p>Two warnings though: (1), the film is an independent American film, so unlikely to show outside a major city -- many of you will probably have to wait for DVD, (2) the glasses are definitely plano -- there is even one scene which makes that quite clear.  So those who like only thickness will be disappointed, but those like me, who are excited mostly by frames will be in heaven.  Although the glasses are not specifically part of the plot, I think the characters choice to wear them is symbolic of her choosing to make her face a framed work of art.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c41</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2009, 04:49</p><p>The start of a new TV season always offers new opportunities for sightings of characters/actresses wearing glasses or updated styles. </p><p>The ABC show, Eastwick, features Lindsay Price as a reporter who wears her glasses much of the time. She could use a more stylish frame choice. </p><p>Also interesting is that in her former show, NBC's Lipstick Jungle, Price never wore spex, but her two co stars did.  Kim Raver often wore stylish glasses and very occasionally Brooke Shields was shown wearing spex for desk work and reading.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2009, 06:27</p><p>Fans of plus lenses should check out new episodes of "The Closer" on TNT in the US.  As she has for years, Kyra Sedgwick wears sharp-looking black plastic frames which she uses as a presbyope. New this season is a character played by Mary McDonnell in a recurring role about every other episode.  She switches between pairs of glasses depicting a presbyopic hyperope occasionally having one pair hanging on her shirt while wearing the others.  Both use their glasses in realistic ways, their lenses are obviously real, and they are fun to watch.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2009, 06:25</p><p>Melyssa: I think Natalie is wearing those glasses for a part that she is playing in "Hesher".  I have never seen her in glasses before, and I don't think she would wear frames like that on her own...probably just for her character in the film.  Or they may be her glasses from when she was much younger, and she decided to use them instead of prop glasses. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Being blind without them, she tripped and made some noise and was caught as a consequence. I'd like to know some movies in which an actress loses her glasses and is blind without them. I know the excellent 'snake eyes' with carla guiguino, vampire bats, in which an actress trips and loses her glasses and is left groping for them... thanks for your help! See ya!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2009, 16:28</p><p>Hillary Duff's glasses are referred to as "Sexy".  Glasses aren't considered ugly anymore.  I also think more famous girls are putting on glasses because it is sexy.  Maybe "Sheep formerly known as Guest" should reevaluate his thoughts about us OO's.  He's been ranting on about how weird we are on another thread (Lots of Links).  Girls wear your glasses proudly! and don't post your picture on the internet if you don't want strangers making comments!  Take it from a GWG who loves Men in Glasses!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>kisal</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2009, 05:47</p><p>Did catch Rockville-CA episodes.  I basically agree with Jan's summary.  But it really is nice to have a GWG on a show with realistically strong specs on and they never make any kind of big deal about it.  As for the switch to contacts, the still photo set does presage that, by photo 30/44 she is, sadly, bare-eyed. So let's enjoy the Deb glasses while we can.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>kisal</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2009, 07:23</p><p>Thanks, Jan for that link.  I'll watch the show later, but I was amused/distressed to see that one of the ads that came up on the page was for contact lenses.

I had to fool it with a proxy. Worked for me, since I´m in europe. </p><p> </p><p>Strange format for a series: It`s basically promotion for a lot of mediocre emo and mainstream rockbands, but the director is suspected to be one of us. Cute Deb is quite nearsighted (in the -5 area i guess) and the makers of the show seem to enjoy that. Huge geek-girl/emo scene stereotype, but this time no props and no stupid use of specs. I didn't like the show itself, but the OO-factor is as high and as realistic as it gets- imho. Let´s hope it`ll take a couple of webisodes till they decide, she has to get contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andy</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2009, 05:33</p><p>And.. towards the end of the 2nd third of the movie, after Martha (Debra Winger) stabbed this guy, dying he grabs her glasses. They are broken at the bridge. Later in the movie when Martha is at the police station her sister has a big argument with the officers to get matha's glasses back. When she has them back, they are fixed with a tape. Later in the movie she wears wire rimmed glasses which look a lot thicker. There is one shot during the movie with a good shot through her glasses. I liked the movie quite a lot because it is very consistent glasses wise.</p><p></p><hr>

D'you remember once (a long looong time ago), there was this guy, Databastard, who had a site featuring screencaps of actresses wearing glasses? There was a link to his site on the ES homepage. I'd really like to find those pix, 'coz there was one girl wearing deliciously thick myopic glasses and I'd like to find that movie's name! Au secours! Help me! Thnx</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2009, 08:27</p><p> Hey everybody, I have been following this site for a long time as with most of you. This discussion has merit from both sides. While I understand the fetish attraction of glasses, I also equaly understand the concerns about minors &amp; posting of pictures on this site. Sometimes it is a hard judgement call as there are alot of pix of young girls (presumably collage age) that are constantly poping up. Are they improper? If I had a kid that age with their pic posted here how would I feel? All viable concerns. Maybe we all should ask ourselves these Questions when we get here. I took the post of the SJP/young lady pic pretty much as the poster said he intended &amp; still thought she might be a little young to be thrown here. I may have done the same in the past not really thinking from all sides.  Bottom line, we all should just spend a little time to think as we share, but please don't stop sharing, that's what this site is.  that's my dime, nuff said. Thanks  </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daffy</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2009, 16:10</p><p>When i posted 'the link' my intension was to show that big glasses from the 80's style are coming back. What intrigued me even more was the fact that younger people were not embarassed but rather 'flaunting' the choice in their frame selection. </p><p> </p><p>Without making further comment to flame the situation further...nuf said.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Traveller</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2009, 11:33</p><p>Let us consider the facts here. </p><p> </p><p>An eyescene user has chosen to post a link to a website that has highlighted the style choice of the 12 year old daughter of a celebrity. The 'Who' magazine article seems to be perfectly responsible in its content and I have no doubt that it may have been of some help to a few parents who have had to deal with their own children being prescribed glasses recently. </p><p> </p><p>I understand the concerns expressed below however this site is very broad in scope. People come here for all sorts of reasons - because they are curious about glasses, because they have been prescribed glasses, because their parents, partners, children, work colleagues etc. wear glasses, because they want glasses and in some cases because they are 'turned on' by glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I would like to think that the vast majority of users of this site are mature enough to consider the material and links that are posted in a mature, sensible way and to consider the context in which they appear. </p><p> </p><p>I would also like to think that even in these dangerous times the majority of us are capable of making sensible judgements without needing others to make the judgements for us. </p><p></p><hr>

They are the blond twins in an acuvue-tv-spot. You know:"She has an astigmatism..." lol. </p><p> </p><p>To my surprise: They both actually wore glasses sometimes! Very hot imho. Especially Sabrina wore them quite often. Two different pairs. One black rectangular and a rimmless pair. I think left eye is significantly stronger. So my guess right -1.5 and left about -3. For example in episode 3 they both went to a casting with rimmless pairs and were holding each others spex, when they had to talk to the casting guy. I would have booked them both! </p><p>Couldn`t find any stills or tubevideos. Someone with more luck? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DWV</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2009, 00:51</p><p>Actresses may not be strictly correct, since this film is a documentary.  "Sherman's March" (1986) was filmed in the early to mid-80s, and is a must-see for anyone who likes big '80s frames with strong prescriptions.  Winnie, a cute linguist gets a lot of screen time about one hour into the film, but there's a briefer close-up of a young mother with equally big and thick glasses nearer the end (when the filmmaker catches up with Burt Reynolds on the set of Stroker Ace).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Karen X</b>&nbsp;05 Jan 2009, 20:59</p><p>Felicity Jones is wearing prescription glasses in "The Diary of Anne Frank" on BBC1 all this week. She is playing Anne's sister Margot. See a picture here <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.bbc.co.uk/annefrank/biogs/margotfrank.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/annefrank/biogs/margotfrank.shtml</a> (bottom half of the page) The frames definitely look 1940s with lowish minus lenses. </p><p>I didn't know Felicity wore glasses as there don't seem to be any photos of her wearing them. She is very attractive, although the 1940s clothes and hairstyle in the series are not very flattering. </p><p>The series is on at 7:00pm every day this week on BBC1 and on the BBC HD channel. Each episode will also be available on the BBC IPlayer within a few hours of broadcast. Here is a link to episode 1 which has several good shots of Felicity in the glasses (she wears them full time in the series, just as Margot Frank did in real life) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00gndt1/The_Diary_of_Anne_Frank_Episode_1/" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00gndt1/The_Diary_of_Anne_Frank_Episode_1/</a> Unfortunately the BBC IPlayer will only work in the UK. Maybe a UK Eyescene reader will be able to get some still pictures and video clips of Felicity in glasses that are available internationally.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ilovepretzels</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2008, 16:51</p><p>The actor that plays Danny on CSI:NY just did an interview and the interviewers very first question was "Where did the glasses go?!" and he said that it was part of 'evolving' the character and it was time for a change. He said that it may or may not be permanent and they were giving it a whirl to see what would happen. </p><p> </p><p>He is very aware though that the fans are not happy about the absence of his glasses.

<p><b>pelegrino</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2008, 12:15</p><p>I think Penelopé Cruz is one of us...recently she was talking about her upcoming movie (directed by Woody Allen) and said in an interview: "He is one of the most respected directors, yet not everybody likes him. Woody Allens movies have this sophisticated humor with the edge of darkness that mostly reflects into one of the movies characters. </p><p>Penelope Cruz who starts in his latest movie Vicky Cristina Barcelona, is that persona and she likes Woody, as she says: </p><p>Everyone loves him in that crew and I got his glasses as a present the last day and I will treasure them. He only had two and he gave me one." </p><p>She also said that she would replace the lenses so that she could see with her own rx...fantastic!!!! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2008, 07:32</p><p>Wurm and Galileo are right.  I have seem non-Rx sunglasses that distort similarly when viewed from the wrong (or right) angle.  These glasses are pure prop. I think the director wanted the impression of serious vision problems, but didn't want the actor's eyes to be distorted as they would be with high plus or minus (see, for example, that little no-neck gnome in "Everything is Illuminated").</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2008, 19:36</p><p>Yes, those appear to be props. Far better than most prop glasses we've seen in the movies, though. </p><p> </p><p>Apparently her eyesight figures into the plot. </p><p> </p><p>Huge photo here: </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.allmoviephoto.com/photo/2008_henry_poole_is_here_002_big.html" target="_blank">http://www.allmoviephoto.com/photo/2008_henry_poole_is_here_002_big.html</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2008, 18:22</p><p>I agree she looks pretty.  If you check out some of the other U-tube clips it gives a flavour of the story and where her glasses fit in. </p><p> </p><p>I think they contain no power at all.  Her eyes look the same size to me glasses on or off.  Any thick piece of glass/plastic will show distortion when viewed from an angle, even if it is plano.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2008, 13:03</p><p>I think she's very pretty in those :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>til</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2008, 11:40</p><p>I think it's just another example of the glasses wearing girl from hollywood. The director may have wanted thick glasses for her so an optician made thick lenses without prescription. Because of the thickness of the lenses it appears to be light to moderate plus from the front but if you look closely at 0:59 in the video you see the distotion which might be possible for light minus or non prescription, but definitely not for plus.  </p><p>Another thing is that she handles the stuff he wants to buy too easy for a heavy plus prescription, she'd see nothing but the colours if she had normal eyesight.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Slit</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2008, 10:42</p><p>re: the thick glasses of girl in henry pool. </p><p> </p><p>I am ptretty sure they are + prescription, thought from sides it looks minus. </p><p> </p><p>What i believe is that lense is constructed in a way that effective power is plus. </p><p> </p><p>The distortion on ceiling is much to plus side. </p><p> </p><p>And IMPORTANT: </p><p>there isnt any cut in which should definitely be there in these glasses if they are minus!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Linuxer</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2008, 08:31</p><p>Very thick but doesn't contain any power. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Correction</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2008, 07:22</p><p>Her glasses clearly are NOT fake.  Take a look at the scene again and when they show her from behind while she is talking, you can see the distortion of the ceiling lights through her glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2008, 07:20</p><p>I actually would disagree with the last posters comments as you can see the lenses are plus and her eyes are magnified, the thickness of them is extremely "interesting"!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>New Seiferth Fan</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2008, 05:58</p><p>The first few seconds of the "Henry Poole" clip where Rachel is looking around at the blurry lines, shows her myopic gaze quite well, and puts on very thick glasses.  And we get extreme closeups of her eyes before and after putting on the glasses.  Well that scene alone was very stimulating to me. </p><p> </p><p>Was there a scene just before that which shows the camera way out of focus to simulate her vision?  Does anyone know if her glasses or weak eyesight play a role in the rest of the film?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2008, 05:52</p><p>I read an article about Tina Fey when she was first "discovered" on SNL.  She was then the head writer when she was cast to read the "news".  They did screen tests with and without her glasses and it was agreed that she fit the part best when wearing.  She has a very week prescription for myopia and seldom wore glasses in public back then which worked great because nobody reconized her in those days without without her "trademark" when out and about.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guido</b>&nbsp;21 Aug 2008, 04:33</p><p>Rachel Weisz and Kate Beckinsale are two of my favorites.  Rachel is not a classic glamour girl, but ther is just something so appealing about her.  I have never seen her in anything that disappointed me.  Kate B. is gorgeous and I could listen to the British accent all day (and night).  I don't know why she has not cauhgt on more.  Every time I surf channels and "Serendipity" is playing I will watch it.  I do not know why she has taken so many "Underworld" type rolls, but her body in skin tight leathers is an attraction.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>matthewson</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2008, 16:21</p><p>Shame Kate Beckinsale got glasses, to quote after a magazine "after she had to squint to see the screen and wear glasses". Now, if that's true and she had to squint to see the screen and wore reading glasses at the same time, she probably had to have bifocals... anyways.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;17 Apr 2008, 08:45</p><p>Born in malaysia, grew up in australia (lots of Indians), now live in the US and work in software (even more Indians) lol </p><p> </p><p>I've never had much of an interest in Indian girls and in general when meeting Indians and some other Western Europeans, intially there is a bit of a common "studious immigrant" ground between us. After a few weeks getting to know me though, I'm usually too "wild" and "american" for most in their eyes so I would think my compatibility with Indian girls is already pretty low though. </p><p> </p><p>Hence why I've gravitated to latinas. Actually there is quite a myth about them being "loose". Maybe the ones that were born and grew up in the US but actual latinas are more conservative than Asians, in Brazil etc. I.e. several dates chaperoned by mother, approval from family, friends, coworkers and the whole time, no holding hands, snuggling, kissing etc of any sort. Real latinas are like good girl/sexy girl in one :D </p><p> </p><p>On the other hand I am looking forward to letting the few Indian friends that I still have know of my new attraction. I imagine there'll be quite some ribbing at my expense ;)  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2008, 16:45</p><p>Aside from this movie, all I know about Bjork is the time she showed up at one of the awards shows in a dress that had a swan's (?) head over her shoulder. Very bizarre. If she was looking to "make a statement" (read: do something unusual and attention-getting) she should have just worn her thick glasses. Then the fashion vultures would have spent the next day just questioning her eyesight, instead of her sanity (the former's the lesser of the 2 "evils", if you ask me, even from a non-OO POV, which I admit I find hard to attain, esp. where thick lenses in black plastic are involved 8;-) ). BTW, does anyone know whether Bjork wears glasses (thick or not) or contacts in real life? </p><p> </p><p>I ALWAYS make passes at guys (and maybe the occasional girl in thick black plastics *sighs and shudders*) who wear glasses, Marie  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2008, 16:45</p><p>Does anyone else remember a movie called "Dancing in the dark", starring singer Bjork? She played a Czech girl who worked in a factory, even though she was very myopic and going blind and really shouldn't have been, but who wanted to be a dancer and was taking dancing lessons. I didn't quite understand all of the storyline (I only saw portions of it, which I'm sure did not help), but I think part of it was she had a son who also had eye problems and needed an operation, which she was working to earn money for, but she wound up stealing from the family she and her son lived with and got caught and...well, I did grasp this much, it doesn't end well. There were also some rather surrealistic song-and-dance numbers, I guess the idea was to portray Bjork's character as somewhat daydream prone and give us a glimpse into her fantasy life? Anyway, I really do have to give Bjork props for her acting as it related to her character being partially sighted. She didn't do the cheesy, obvious, "arms stretched out in front of me to feel where I'm going" kind of portrayal of blindness. I've known a few people who were either partially or totally blind, and I can assure you, they do not behave this way! It was good that she did it in such a subtle, classy way because 1. She remembered she was only partially blind and still had some sight and 2. Even people who are totally blind aren't usually very obvious about it, if they have been blind for some time, anyway, and had a chance to adjust. There was one scene where she is sitting at a table having coffee and as she pours herself a cup, you can see if you're observant that she has one of her fingers inside the rim of the cup to feel when to stop pouring. But she does it in such an easy, casual way, that you would hardly notice if you weren't paying very close attention. The other thing is, her glasses in this movie are thick, the edges come out of their black plastic frame (MMMM! I know, I'm straight, but I don't care, thick lenses in a black plastic frame, MMMM! *sighs and shudders*), but I can't quite figure out the rx on them. There does definitely appear to be some minus power, you can see some minification, but I didn't really notice any power rings or much cut-in (though I realize certain camera angles don't show these effects). They certainly don't look as strong as you'd expect lenses of that thickness to be, but then this was (I think) the pre-high-index era and since the lens edges were "frosted" (not polished) they probably looked a little thicker than they really were.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2008, 18:08</p><p>I guess I have to go find Spy Kids now, was it Spy Kids 1 or 2? and Night at the Museum too I guess. </p><p> </p><p>I remember seeing one of them and she was in it, but don't really remember any glasses scenes. Then again I also don't remember watching the whole thing. Im still really impressed at all the details from Snake Eyes though, especially when she walks across the room pretending like she can see where shes going in the casino. It makes me think that she had to be nearsighted irl but likely she isn't is even more impressive for her acting chops: :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>chrisB </b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2008, 14:25</p><p>I think Carla wore glasses in Spykids, along with Antonio Banderas for presbyopia as the director's shorthand for ageing (spy) parents. </p><p>However in Night at the Museum, I think Carla wears glasses again as a museum researcher so maybe?? </p><p> </p><p>I agree BTW, that Snake eyes is one of the most intriguing GWG films. </p><p> </p><p>Chris </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>til</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2008, 13:29</p><p>I don't know wheter she wears glasses in real life but I think I saw her once wearing glasses in 'Spy Kids'.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2008, 06:41</p><p>I just watched Snake Eyes after a mad fiending for Carla Gugino that just came out of the blue. I remember her vividly because of this movie and how much it tickled my OO-ness back when I was a teen.  </p><p> </p><p>For those that haven't seen it, she plays a highly shortsighted girl who gets embroiled in a conspiracy, her glasses get crushed in the beginning of the movie and throughout the rest of the movie, a lot of time is spent on how little she sees and how she copes squinting and groping her way through. There are some great out of focus nearsighted from her POV shots as well as some very convincing and amazing squinting on her part.  </p><p> </p><p>However the best came for last, during the ending she has finally got a new pair of glasses but amazingly, they look like a myopic prescription as well and similar to the strength that would be required for what was shown in the movie. You can see it here. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://img144.imageshack.us/my.php?image=vlcsnap2300154gl8.png" target="_blank">http://img144.imageshack.us/my.php?image=vlcsnap2300154gl8.png</a> </p><p> </p><p>Now my question is, does she wear glasses irl (ive not seen her in them anywhere else) or is De Palma a real stickler for the OO details similar to De Niro</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;11 Dec 2007, 15:19</p><p>Julie Delpy directs, writes and stars in the movie "2 Days In Paris". Also she wears a pair of "Woody Allen"-style glasses almost for the whole movie. Of course they are not prescription lenses... </p><p>There is one scene where she is at bed, starting to have sex with Adam Goldberg and she is wearing her glasses. As he is on top of her, he removes her glasses and she says "Please, I can't see you. I could be having sex with Gregory Peck or something". </p><p>Later on she is getting dressed and he comments on her not wearing glasses and she says she finally found her contacts. But fortunately she keeps wearing glasses later in the movie.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lovehewettandglasses</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2007, 02:35</p><p>anybody know if Jennifer L Hewitt is myopic or hyperopic. couldn't figure it out from the foto. thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2007, 02:10</p><p>She was wearing them last night on EE, there was a scene where she spent ages getting ready (doing makeup) without her glasses on then later in the show they cut to a scene of her all dressed up and walking down the street wearing her glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>EE isn't on the TV on Wednesday's so we'll have to wait 'til Thursday now</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2007, 07:26</p><p>I wouldn't mind seeing some clips of her and especially the squinting etc </p><p> </p><p>Haven't found any vids on youtube so far</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2007, 06:42</p><p>I don't know if the gwg on Eastenders is a really myope/hyperope (who knows what she is after this debate) as the episode was recently shot and only time will tell if she wears them all the time (on the show).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2007, 06:38</p><p>Well she must have amazing luck picking specs then, getting a pair that looks that good on her on her first try lol</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russ</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2007, 06:26</p><p>Jennifer L Hewitt looks totally amazing in those glasses. I just wish that her character on "Ghost Whisperer" would wear glasses, that would make her character much more interesting and very much hotter.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2007, 01:32</p><p>I don't watch Eastenders. But wow that Dawn girl looks amazing in specs. Is the actress who plays her a real-life gwg?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2007, 00:55</p><p>gwgs: Yes, but there is a tendency to use 'short sighted' as a catchall term for not seeing well. A while back I was looking in a shop window with a young friend; the price ticket on one item was concealed by something else, and I asked Jason, who's a lot taller than me, if he could tell me what it was. His reply: "Sorry, I can't read it, I'm short sighted; well, actually I'm long sighted." My case rests.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2007, 00:37</p><p>Glasses for everyone - I saw this episode last night, it was quite funny...I can't remember all the script but there were a few puns that other characters were saying, one them in particular who is trying to date her said "I see you've got glasses, you look smart" she replied "I've always been smart", he then replied saying "Maybe we can see more of each other now". The response wasn't favourable!! hahaha </p><p> </p><p>Where Eastenders hadn't done her research is the character said she was shortsighted yet she picking the frames from a market stall, the first ones she tried on she bought and that was that. Clearly (sorry about the pun!) these would be reading glasses though!!! </p><p> </p><p>Despite buying these glasses, in the next scene she isn't wearing and only puts them on to read a menu in a nightclub. Again, this indicates she is the opposite of short sighted. Sort it out Eastenders!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Laura Fan</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2007, 05:50</p><p>Laura San Giacomo's glasses are really quite thick in Saving Grace.  And what adds to the pleasure are several scenes where she acts realistically with and without her STRONG glasses.  There are many shots behind her and you can see how distorted things look through the lenses.  I find it difficult sitting through an episode if you know what I mean. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob</b>&nbsp;30 Aug 2007, 08:51</p><p>While the movie was not great overall, Proof starring Scarlet Johanson is a must see for gwg fans. She wears glasses pretty much the whole time, only taking them off at times a person would normally take glasses off. And when the guy suggests she would be prettier without her glasses, she simply shrugged it off as a silly suggestion and kept the glasses on her face. Even if you don't like mediocre Woody Allen movies, you might check this one out.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andy</b>&nbsp;30 Aug 2007, 05:08</p><p>GwGs not so much a mystery to me. Let's say she has had lasik correcting a mild myopia of about -3D. As she got older now  nature strikes back. Before lasik she simply could have taken her glasses off. Now she requires plus lenses instead. It's similar with Sharon Stone. She has never had lasik, but went from a mild minus prescription to a very low plus as she became older. My mother experienced the same thing. She went from a very mild -1D at age 40 to a+1.75D for distance vision and for reading to a +3.0D now at age 78. This process went very slow.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2007, 11:42</p><p>Tod:  Whenever I see someone with their glasses pulled down to the end of their nose, I assume that they are reading glasses.  I agree with you; I have seen Michelle in other pictures with different glasses on, and given her age, they are probably progressives.  But then why would she be wearing them down on the end of her nose?  She would have to tilt her head awfully far back to see through the add at the bottom of the lens... </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;14 Aug 2007, 21:28</p><p>Curt, Michelle Pfeiffer glasses are not "reading glasses". she is a hyperope who has to wear glasses full time. Though her lenses may be progressives which includes a reading add most likely in that she is over 40 as well most hyperopes require a reading add at a much younger age than 40.</p><p></p><hr>

She puts them on in reading situations and they are some stylish semi-rimless frames, much more sytlish than Laura's "nerd glasses.

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2007, 23:26</p><p>Thanks for the link to the show. Looks like I have something new to watch :) show is a nice bit of escapism even if it has that "Canadian, but trying to be as American as possible on a lower budget" vibe to the show. Vicki's frames are exceptionally well chosen and feminising, since she still has a very masculine face even for an attractive woman. Definitely from 8 to 10 material :D </p><p> </p><p>One thing that irks me though is how ill developed the whole RP angle is. To me it seems like a fatal writer's goof. It's only being used as subject for bad goofs and Vicki definitely doesnt act like she's going blind. No one seems to be in any hurry to take best advantage of the time she has left with her sight, male suitors included. I know I would. The whole thing is so barely touched on that I suspect the network execs and everyone involved just wants the whole thing written out by season 2, which I suspect it will be via dark arts powers or what not. </p><p> </p><p>Im enjoying the show for what it is though, catching up download by download ;) shes fantastic in glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

For foreigners and youth, there was a very popular American TV show in the 60's and 70's called "The Brady Bunch" that featured a large family including two sisters Jan, who wore glasses at least part time and wasn't happy about that, and her prettier older sister Marcia.

So to go from a high myopic prescription to a + is something admirable for a gwg fan. </p><p> </p><p>I haven't seen even half the movie but it is definitely worth buying it to check her out</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;07 May 2007, 09:57</p><p>Great sighting on this week's episode of "The Riches", a show on the FX network about a family of con artists. Saw the girl who plays the daughter (Shannon Marie Woodward) wearing fairly strong minus lenses for much of the show, strong enough to require flat fronts anyway. A quick search reveals that the episode was called "Cinderella". </p><p> </p><p>She's a regular cast member, but I don't think her character is actually meant to need glasses; she used them as part of her "costume" for the episode, posing as (I think) the father's secretary. Still, they were almost certainly the actress's real prescription. </p><p> </p><p>Certainly one to watch in the future for more sightings. Her IMDb page has one picture in glasses: </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0940990/" target="_blank">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0940990/</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2007, 13:46</p><p>Just had to put in my 2 cents on the new Lifetime TV series "Blood Ties". I like the show, with it's vampire theme (I sometimes wonder if my "glasses thing" is my weirdest weird thing or my "normal weird thing" compared to some of my other odd fancies) and references to the main characters gradually dimming sight from retinitis pigmentosa "and to top it all off, I'm nearsighted!" as she said. Not that you could tell by looking at her glasses, yet another pair of " 'scriptless wonder" prop glasses. Good grief, people, is your production budget so small you can't afford to shell out a couple hundred extra bucks for a pair of REAL glasses, of the sort that an actual nearsighted person would actually wear? I mean, they don't even have to be strong, just please give us something that isn't so laughably obviously fake! And, for heaven's sake, have her use them in a manner consistent with how real myopes use their glasses-don't have her put them on every time she has to read something up close, then have scenes where she recognizes someone from across a large room without them and with nary a squint. You'd think surely someone on the production team would be a nearsighted person who might point out some of these things, maybe even offer to lend the actress a pair of his/her spare specs if the prop budget really was a problem (at least that's what I would do if I was on the production team of a show with a "nearsighted" character). At least they did have enough respect for realism not to tell us she was going blind and then show scenes with her driving! I'm actually thinking of writing the producer of the program and explaining all this, I wonder if any of us lens-aware people have ever done this? Who knows, maybe if we wrote to the producers of movies/TV shows that feature fake four-eyes we'd actually see an increase in appropriately attired eyes? Anyway, it's a good program if you're into vampires/other paranormal creatures and P.I.s who are slowly going blind, but as a "glasses show" it's a disappointment. I give it two thumbs up, but specs slid wayyyy down on the nose...oh, no, there they go...CRACK! Ohhhh, hit the concrete! Oh well, maybe now we can get her some real ones. </p><p> </p><p>I ALWAYS make passes at guys who wear glasses, Marie  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ChrisB</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2007, 15:34</p><p>Jessica Biel is very appealing, even in what seem quite ordinary frames in some pics.  </p><p> </p><p>It has been commented before that there are some GWGs who's choice of frames and 'look' is such that they always hit the spot, or whatever we OOs have as our 'thing  of desire', 'person of libidinous intent' 'fantasy fxx buddy' 'hearts desire' etc etc.  </p><p> </p><p>I have sometimes been thankful that close GWG colleagues did not 'hit the spot', so I didnt have to think about them as GWGs. On the other hand, I am driven mad, almost daily by a GWG colleague who always returns my smile ..... ( perhaps this should have gone in 'sightings'. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2007, 10:23</p><p>I the movie "If ever I see you again", the two main characters both wear real minus eyeglasses throughout the movie.  The woman star is Shelley Hack, who later appeared in Charlie's Angels, though minus glasses in that TV show.  That was the first time I ever saw the star of the movie wear real glasses and keep them on for the entire movie.  Well, I guess Debra Winger in a Dangerous Woman wore real minus glasses for more than 90% of the movie.  I still don't understand why she was considered dangerous though.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>kisal</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2007, 07:38</p><p>Yet another GWG film disappointment! And this is only place I can rant. Will movies ever get glasses right.  I went to see "The Namesake" this weekend (by the way it is a great movie and worth seeing despite what I am about to say) and was really looking forward to seeing the main character's (Gogol's) wife in glasses, since her glasses were mentioned several times in the book.  When she first shows up she is wearing sexy black frames (although she mostly peers over them which I found rather annoying) and they are clearly not a turn-off to Gogol.  Then she wears them briefly in one more scene before he takes them off before they go have sex.  I don't object to that in itself (it's in the book) but then after that the glasses never appear again.  Once again glasses are simply a prop, like a hat, to be used, removed and then forgotten about.  It would have been much better and more realistic if she had continued to be bespectacled throughout.  Except for Scarlett Johansson in "Scooped," I can't think of the last woman in film whose glasses were portrayed as anything more than a prop or affectation.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2007, 07:29</p><p>Unfortunately you don't remember it well. At the start she doesn't wear glasses. When she gets infected by the alien parasite (although we don't know it yet in the movie), she starts wearing her glasses. The others are quite suspicious at some point why she put her glasses that day. </p><p> </p><p>Later on we find out that she had put her glasses because the aliens are obsessive with water and the contacts made her eyes dry. Of course this would mean that the alien parasite didn't improve her vision and she still would depend by her glasses, but after the others have found out she is infected, she ditches the glasses and we no longer see her with them on. Hollywood... </p><p> </p><p>Alas the frames were of beautiful design...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>darkglassesfan</b>&nbsp;01 Feb 2007, 07:58</p><p>Katy Manning appeared on a show called "Going for a Song" sometime in the late Sixties, maybe 1970. It was a precursor to the "Antiques Roadshow". They used to have a couple of experts and a couple of guest collectors. Katy was one of the latter. I don't think Katy's glasses had myodisks, but her lenses were very thick with lots of power rings and cut-in. I bet they must've been at least -20 and probably not high-indexed. The lenses were also tinted dark brown, probably to try to disguise the power rings. They also had large tortoiseshell frames. The cameraman kept zooming in on whatever objects she was looking at, which gave a wonderful view of her lenses. I think it's still the best view of a high myope on TV I've ever seen.  </p><p>Does anyone remember a backing group called "The Ladybirds" that were around at about that time. They used to be on the Simon Dee show every Saturday on the BBC? One of the girls always wore dark glasses with thick prescription lenses. She was a real treat!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>cut-in UK</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2007, 00:20</p><p>Therouter, I think you miss the point with Jade. We recognise her as displaying racist characteristics because we are now conditioned to. She isn't a racist because the doesn't really understand true racism. She is a woman without education and totally devoid of social skills. She saw the very prescence of Ms. Shetty as a threat. The latter is polished and sophisticated having been some time in the toughest business in the world. Her 'race' is incidental as poor Jade is just using the crude weapons of the street, and instincts inherited from her upbringing. The glasses, (the only relevant point in this forum) are probably an idea from her publicist, to enhance, an otherwise coarse and unrefined appearance. She is only there as a notorious figure of fun and I doubt that her eyesight is in need of correction.  You can see a million 'Jades' who live their lives in permanent conflict because they don't understand how the world works. Ms. Shetty outclasses her without even opening her mouth and this is the true nature of the conflict. She clearly is 'different' and her only crime was not 'dumbing down' to Jade's level. She would have received the same treatment had she been Anglo-Saxon or a natural blonde Swede. Thank god she wasn't wearing glasses as well; Jade would have probably pulled them off her nose and snapped them ! Funny old world isn't it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2007, 02:49</p><p>It's an interesting point you raise about Claire (Julia Haworth from Coronation Street) as I only started this poor excuse for a show when she started wearing spex and the first time she wore them everyone commented on them and in fact they all went out for a drink to the pub to celebrate her new eyewear!!! </p><p> </p><p>How many girls do that!? She fiddled with them a lot then and seemed very proud to be wearing them, since them she has changed her frames once but I got a bit bored of watching Corrie and therefore didn't she'd stopped wearing them. </p><p> </p><p>It's a shame as the soap world needs more gwgs, I still miss Lisa Kay who played Anna in Hollyoaks - she was my dream girl. </p><p> </p><p>Re: Jo from ex pop group S Club 7, she is cute without glasses, then when I saw her wearing hexi rimless glasses I was even more taken with her.

<p><b>cut-in UK</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2007, 15:12</p><p>Maverick, in the matter of Clare, she didn't have a high degree of myopia; probably no more than -2.5. She has , in fact that almost archetypal English prettiness, 'pale and interesting'.  Although the character she plays is a little old-fashioned, I can't believe a girl with -2.5 would risk 'Lasik' Is it worth an e-mail to Granada TV on the off-chance she might confirm/deny the suggestion?  </p><p> </p><p>You obviously rate the lady too !  </p><p> </p><p>Just as an aside, don't you think that the actors/actresses in soaps generally play 'themselves' rather than portray characters where they need to exercise serious acting talent. (Not getting at anyone in particular; just an observation) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2007, 14:25</p><p>Re Claire in Corrie there has been no real storyline to explain why she suddenly stopped wearing glasses. She just made one comment along the line that 'had'nt you noticed I stopped wearing them a week ago' and that was it. </p><p>Probably the actress who plays her had lasik ?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2007, 13:40</p><p>Mike, </p><p> </p><p>You're thinking of Lauren Graham...not Heather Graham.  But if you want some Heather Graham in glasses pictures, check out the movie Killing Me Softly or Sidewalks of New York.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mike</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2007, 05:04</p><p>Saw "Bad Santa" the other night which was lots of fun, and more to the point had the very beautiful milf Heather Graham as the main love interest.  After searching for all of 2 seconds I had loads of pics of her wearing specs with a fair cut-in on The Gilmore Girls.  Apparently she only wears them very occassionally but I guess from the cut-in she wears contacts the rest of the time. </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=34067637" target="_blank">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid;=34067637</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;13 Dec 2006, 09:17</p><p>I am half way through Scoop as well and what is funny is the way Scarlett constantly fiddles with her glasses i.e. pushing them up, readjusting them etc. She even wears them in her towelling robe before swimming. </p><p> </p><p>Now how would a director get this across to an actress? "You must touch your glasses at least 50 times during the movie, oh yeah and make sure you wear them all the time too"??!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Therouteur</b>&nbsp;13 Dec 2006, 05:55</p><p>I'm in the middle of the dvd but I just have to stop and record that "Scoop" totally confirms Woodie Allen as, alongside Hitchcock, the most obssessed OO director of them all. I don't need to enumerate all of his gwg leading and otherwise women: Diane Keaton, Mia Farrow, Soong-yi, his wife/ step-daughter. But the scene I've just left (and will return to tout de suite) shows conclusively Scarlett Johanssen (oh, be still, my beating heart) immediately after having had sex with her gkasses still on. This is quite explicit. </p><p>Any more thoughts on OO directors??</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2006, 18:52</p><p>A good GWG movie is one called 'Student Exchange' a 1987 ABC movie of the week. It may be on DVD/video now a days. The protaganist is a nerdy high school girl with glasses who dyes her hair and puts in contact lenses to imposter a French foreign exchange student at her own high school (one who is sexy and popular). But she has problems wearing the contacts and at one point is seen rubbing her eye to keep them in while being confronted by the stuck up popular girls. When at home as her real self, she wears her glasses in front of her parents and her little sister. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2006, 19:32</p><p>I have seen several recent pics of Ms. Murphy. In each she seems to only be wearing her right lens. Maybe she is doing the monovision thing. Often myopes will remove their glasses or look over the top of them in order to read. So maybe this is what she is doing contact lens style?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ChrisB</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2006, 13:49</p><p>Wonderful pictures (pun) of Lynda Carter. I never saw her on television, except in re-runs of the Muppets, I think I was out having a life during then. </p><p>She still looks pretty hot nowadays (dukes of hazzard) but with no glasses unfortunately. The prescription in those shots is strange, in some shots The left lens looks hi minus but but in other shots particularly the drop temples the rx could be +. I also remember that my wife had frames at that time that were tortishell and nearly as big. So seeing these Pix is quite nostalgic as my wife gave up wearing hers (for mild hyperopia) much to my sadness.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ChrisB</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2006, 15:24</p><p>watching the film 'Keeping Mum' its very nice to seek Kristin Scott Thomas wearing what seem to be her own glasses when she is driving. In the same film, in the first few minutes there's a scene set in the 1960s where Emilia Fox is wearing reading glasses of the time. I remember my mum having exactly the same frames. </p><p>The film itself is really good by the way.</p><p></p><hr>

It's not a bad movie but it was a long wait to see Rosario Dawson's fairly brief appearance.  She's gorgeous in heavy black frames with a weak but definite Rx but her role was quite minor in this one and I had hoped there would be more of her.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>loveglasses1</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2006, 11:23</p><p>hi everyone </p><p>just to let you know that by far the best gwg actress is on coronation street tonight (uk 7.30 and 8.30)claire peacock who currently is suffering from depression but still wearing her gorgeous glasses all the time, the actual actress does wear in real life but i have no idea whether the glasses are real or prop but she is still really sexy</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2006, 05:51</p><p>There is no question in my opinion that Lynda Carter is quite myopic and the lenses in the WW clips are her own . There are interviews where she refers to her poor eyesight - eg on the WW Series 1 DVD where she comments on needing floor markers to find her way around the set. I also recall a magazine interview some ago where the interviewer commented on her 'coke bottle' glasses (and Lynda added that her hearing was poor as well......)  She of course does the Lens Crafters CL's advertising. </p><p>As far as WW goes in Series 2 and Series 3 whenever she is required to drive off come the planos and on with the prescription which is logical for saftey reasons. There are also pics around of her wearing her prescription specs when playing tennis. </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2006, 00:49</p><p>If you are talking about Lynda, you are right on the mark; </p><p> </p><p>In these two caps she is wearing two different pairs of spex with evident cut in displaying a medium to high myopic prescription - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://uk.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/gwgs1/detail?.dir=92a2&amp;.dnm=9e1fre2.jpg&amp;.src=ph" target="_blank">http://uk.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/gwgs1/detail?.dir=92a2&amp;.dnm=9e1fre2.jpg&amp;.src=ph</a>  and  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://uk.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/gwgs1/detail?.dir=92a2&amp;.dnm=5328re2.jpg&amp;.src=ph" target="_blank">http://uk.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/gwgs1/detail?.dir=92a2&amp;.dnm=5328re2.jpg&amp;.src=ph</a> </p><p> </p><p>But as we've discussed before, could these be contact lenses underneath these glasses which appear to be planos? </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://uk.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/gwgs1/detail?.dir=92a2&amp;.dnm=7e40.jpg&amp;.src=ph" target="_blank">http://uk.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/gwgs1/detail?.dir=92a2&amp;.dnm=7e40.jpg&amp;.src=ph</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;03 Sep 2006, 08:56</p><p>it seems obvious from her acting that these are not her glasses (unfortunately) probably a stage prop that for some reason had real optical lenses, she doesn't seem to be able to see much with them (in other episodes she wears planos) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>kisal</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2006, 19:17</p><p>Yes, "Scoop" is absolutely magnificent!  It is the kind of movie that is almost (but fortunately not quite) non-existent--  where an attractive woman wears glasses from start to finish in a movie, where she doesn't take them off when she gets romantic and where other characters aren't continually drawing attention to them.  Scarlett's character Sondra (or Jade) just wears them and that't that.  Kate Winslett's character in "Enigma" came close to this ideal, but she ruined it by showing up non-bespectacled in the last scene.  Scarlett only takes them off to swim and sleep.</p><p></p><hr>

She wears them the whole movie, When her love intrest takes them off she puts them back on saying " I can't see without them &amp; I can't wear contacts because I can't stand to touch my eye! </p><p>   The glasses look like they might have a slight magnafacation as her eyes look alittle bigger, but I'm not sure. The movie was good &amp; you get to look at Scarlet with Glasses for an hour and a half.  She's so Hot!!!!</p><p></p><hr>

Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson have a romantic walk and at the end he removes her glasses and reaches to kiss her. While at first she seems to respond and kiss him, then she takes back her glasses and says "Sorry I need those. You see I can't wear contacts, I don't like to put my finger on my eyeball." </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bart</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2006, 06:36</p><p>I think that Scarlett Johansson is astigmatic, so she got troubles seeing close up too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2006, 02:25</p><p>Things I just remembered. </p><p> </p><p>She wasn't a celebrity, at least not well known, probably more like a dancer at a club or something. I've found celebrity lists but I don't think she's going to be listed. </p><p> </p><p>I think it was more like Dec 2000. Her glasses were also tinted gray, I think to hide that they were prescription (but she kept them all the time :D). I would have posted earlier except it took another year or so for me to find this place lol. </p><p> </p><p>She made quite an impression though, I still think of her every now and then :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2006, 02:18</p><p>I was just thinking of an amazing girl (blonde_ I saw on the Howard Stern show back in 2001 (layed over in Hawaii, too crowded, not fun). Little round glasses, slid down her nose a lot, but amazing ass.  </p><p> </p><p>Poor Howard tried to seem impartial and get on with the show but he kept getting her to pull down her panties over and over again every 5 minutes :) , but of course I only noticed her glasses :) </p><p> </p><p>I think her name might have started with M, but I was wondering if anyone saw it and remembers who she was, or knows where I can find a complete guest list. It might have also been a rerun :P</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;14 Jul 2006, 01:00</p><p>Amanda Donohoe made her debut in the new series of Bad Girls on ITV last night (9pm). She plays the deputy governor of the prison and wears heavy framed hexi spex. </p><p> </p><p>I was intrigued to see whether these were prescription as I have seen her wearing spex before and this would be a good test. I am pleased to comment that there is a substantial + prescription and cut in was evident on numerous occasions. On one occasion the camera zoomed in on her walking into the room and as she moved her head to the side you could clearly see the magnification! </p><p> </p><p>The part I found annoying was she took her glasses off and didn't have them back on for 1/4 of the show but when there was some close up work to be done she put them back on :)</p><p></p><hr>

It's reairing this Thursday night @9PM, I believe.  Check it out!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>oscar</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2006, 04:26</p><p>I don't know if anyone's mentioned the movie "High School Musical" (Disney, 2006) before. The composer in it is a character called Kelsi (played by the extremely cute Olesya Rulin) and she wears low minus glasses throughout the movie. It's difficult to tell from this clip, but there's a shot about 48 secs in which shows a little bit of cut-in. In other words, they are real glasses. Obviously on the DVD the lenses show up much better, and there are quite lot of shots of her. Even in the number that's the grand finale of the movie she wears her specs.  </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYK_SLZRgns&amp;search=high%20school%20musical" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYK_SLZRgns&amp;search;=high%20school%20musical</a> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SZ6</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2006, 08:24</p><p>Thanks for that summary! I wonder why it is that more modern films don't have female characters who are obviously blind without their glasses. It seems like this was a lot more prevalent in older films and foreign (non-American) films. Those of you who live outside the US, do you tend to see this kind of character in films from your home country these days, or is it truly a relic of the past?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2006, 09:24</p><p>Theroteur - I'm looking forward to Match Point; I've just bought a 42" plasma tv which has only had one snip of gwg action on it so far so if Match Point comes out soon it'll be a good chance to get to know my telly :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Therouteur</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2006, 07:09</p><p>1) Anonymous. Many thanks. That's good news about Scoop. </p><p>2) gwgs. In fact I've just finished rewatching Match Point on wide screen dvd. Not my choice but la Therouteuse loves a chick flick and, like me, thinkd Scarlett J is hot. Had a bit of trouble calming her down at certain points.  </p><p>However. </p><p>On the bigger screen you can quite clearly see her contacts in close ups. </p><p>Unfortunately none of this changes the basic point that it's a shit flick, at least as I see it. La T who is a sensitive soul when it comes to these things (when she's not overcome with excitement at scenes of passion involving SJ) said; "What's weird is that it's a snobby upper class New York view of what the English upper classes are all about but actually they're quite different. Not nearly as class obsessed as the New Yorkers" </p><p>She may well think that. I couldn't possibly comment. But SJ is still HOT. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;31 May 2006, 16:39</p><p>Therouteur,  </p><p>   I think you are thinking of Match Point and not Scoop (she is in two Woody Allen film's back to back).  Scoop has Scarlett wearing glasses, and it doesn't come out until the end of July whereas Match Point just came out on DVD and she isn't wearing glasses in that.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Therouteur</b>&nbsp;31 May 2006, 15:19</p><p>I checked out the new Woodie Allen movie with the luscious Scarlett Johanssen on a plane yesterday and, as far as I could see (before I fell asleep out of utter boredom - it's definitely a chick flick) there's good news and bad news. The bad news is that there's not even a slight g-sighting (new technical term) anywhere in the movie. The good news is that this seems to suggest that the glasses we saw in all those pictures with her and the ageing degenerate are probably her own and not just props to satisfy the Woodster's optic obsessions. </p><p>If anyone's managed to stay awake through the whole thing and actually sighterd some glasses I'd be fascinated to hear.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glasses4ever</b>&nbsp;31 May 2006, 03:20</p><p>Since I saw a couple of episodes of the Gilmore Girls series 4 in which Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) is wearing real prescritpion eyeglasses, I'm fascinating about what a TV fiction can say you about the real life of actors/actresses. </p><p> </p><p>In fact, since glasses are real, but are not so relevant to the story (so no need to add them to the Lorelai character, I think), the only explanation for their use is that the real Lauren needs them to play, and have to wear them when she cannot wear contacts for some reason. </p><p> </p><p>Is it also true that with a prescription like that (I guess low nearsightedness, less than -3), Lauren should be more than able to play on the set without any correction. Why, instead, she appears with glasses? Perhaps she forgot to remove them once and they began part of the story from then on? Which is your intepretation? </p><p> </p><p>Here is a screenshots, many others available on the same WEB site. </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.lauren-graham.net/displayimage.php?album=5&amp;pos=127" target="_blank">http://www.lauren-graham.net/displayimage.php?album=5&amp;pos;=127</a></p><p></p><hr>

He does this like clockwork with female celebs in glasses; I also saw him ask Lisa Loeb and Ashleigh Banfield to remove their specs so he could have a look.) </p><p> </p><p>Megan's glasses didn't look nearly as strong as -6, though.

<p><b>Slit</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2006, 04:10</p><p>Since the discussion about attraction to a disablity is getting intense here, i thought of posting this. </p><p> </p><p>Just think about a situation where a guy prefers a girl with a low cut neckline which shows the cleavage and turns on the guy sexually. It is a sexual feeling aroused by a something worn by the girl, which she was not born with. </p><p> </p><p>Such is the situation with the girls with glasses! Some girls have the ability to arouse men when they wear glasses. </p><p> </p><p>In the same time there are men who preferentially get sexually turned on when seeing a beauty in glasses. It is very much analogical to the fact that some people get turned on by the way some girls dress! </p><p> </p><p>So my friends, we should understand that its the diversity that makes this world colourful.

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;22 Mar 2006, 16:22</p><p>Glasses 'fetish' is the reverse of a disability thing, obviously.Nobody could ever find any form of 'disability' sexy, quite obviously.The whole point about glasses is that when the woman is wearing her glasses she can see perfectly,and therefore acquires an attractive, positive, 'I'm going to conquer the world and all the men in it' sort of look. That's the sex appeal of glasses. I am very much a frames man....................whilst the lenses must be minus to give that 'focussed' intellectual look, the same woman would be totally unsexy wearing naff studenty gold metal ovals as opposed to confident business woman black rectangular plastic frames with wide sides. But that's because I like bold, confident, intellectual women.But although lenses must be minus, frames are where it's at. The difference between naff studenty gold metal ovals and sexy business woman black rectangular plastics is like the difference between a woman wearing bedroom slippers and shiny stilettos.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;22 Mar 2006, 14:24</p><p>Hey ChrisB...  Actually, that's Kristin Chenowith in Bewitched (not Heather Graham...who does wear glasses in Sidewalks of New York and Killing me Softly, to name a few).  Chenowith also typically wears glasses on The West Wing (Sunday @8 on NBC).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;22 Mar 2006, 14:16</p><p>I agree with that Yoyo - it is different for everyone. I have to say that I understand what MPHC is talking about - planos have no effect on me either - and neither do glasses which are not the person's own prescription. If a gorgeous guy tried on someone else's -10s, that would be slightly interesting.. if they were his own, it would be incredible. But I think there are plenty of people on here that don't care what someone's rx is, as long as they have glasses. That can be either a preference or a fetish, but most people with a 'preference' wouldn't bother reading this site. I would love to understand how low rxs can be sexy - I think that fetish is rooted in something completely different to mine, which is all about the person _needing_ the glasses. Anyway, nothing to do with Actresses :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;22 Mar 2006, 13:44</p><p>Glasses fetish isn't just paraphilic in nature, though certainly the whole "disability" aspect is a big factor. But some folks here have talked about being interested in choice of frames, how they enhance a person's face, or in the bold fashion statement that may be made by wearing specs. </p><p> </p><p>I certainly find it interesting (and a bit arousing) when a girl wears weak prescription glasses all the time; she is clearly making a choice to wear them, which is very sexy and cool.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ChrisB</b>&nbsp;22 Mar 2006, 13:08</p><p>After all the stuff about spice girls and now the debate about plano's I feel a change of 'focus' is needed. </p><p>Could we discuss who might be the most under reported but nicest GWG Actress? </p><p> </p><p>My vote would go to Heather Graham. I have seen her on a couple of DVDs where the special features show her as a GWG. My kids have just been watching 'Bewitched' and she features there as a production assistant and buddy to Nicole Kidman. Her character wears quite strong plus lenses - which I presume are her own prescription. </p><p>Anybody able to get some screen caps? </p><p> </p><p>ChrisB</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anon</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2006, 20:06</p><p>Yes of course it's a glasses fetish site.  I don't deny that.  But when you look at the remark in context he says planos don't belong because this is a glasses fetish site.  He goes on to explain what real lenses are.  Who's he to say that planos have no part in a glasses fetish?  I found that amusing.  I just didn't explain myself as well as I should have. </p><p> </p><p>I also believe this site has something to offer to non-fetishists as some threads pertain to non-fetish subjects such as low vision, refractive surgery etc.  Not EVERYONE who arrives here has such a fetish, although most of those who stay probably do.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MPHC</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2006, 15:20</p><p>Anon, </p><p>This is most certainly a Glasses Fetish Site. Any attempt to claim otherwise is clearly ridiculous. Also I think you'll find that every thread on here relates to a Glasses fetish either directly or indirectly. </p><p>Now about planos. I'm all for being inclusive and of course folks are entitled to their preferences. I just think you are missing the point somewhat if you get excited looking at a girl (or man) wearing fake glasses. Would plano contact lenses have the same effect? This is more a "preference" than a fetish, like preferring tall people, blond people, skinny people etc. Planos say nothing about the wearer (other than a. they are an actor wearing a prop for a film or b. they have no style and think that wearing a fake medical appliance  somehow enhances their appearance) in the same way that being tall says nothing about a pperson other than that they are tall. Would these same people consider wearing a hearing aid for the same reason? I think probably not. A true glasses fetish I believe is paraphilic in nature and it is this with which I am afflicted. The bottom line is I find planos no more interesting than no glasses at all. I'm not trying to antagonise people, just trying to generate a little discussion. This has gone off topic somewhat but I would be genuinely interested in what people find exciting about planos or low prescriptions. Maybe you can educate me. The psychology thread is probably the most suitable in which to continue this discussion.</p><p></p><hr>

There was a film on TV a few years back that has been mentioned here, (I cant remember its title) who had a teen girl with convincing looking myodisc-like glasses, which on close inspection were plano. The people who made the glasses for Linda Cardellini to play Velma should have consulted them on how to do this, not to mention how to put in the o-so-seventies blue tint.

<p><b>Berry</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2006, 03:37</p><p>Having Lasik doesn't mean you won't need glasses. It all depends on how much correction is needed. I used to be around -11. Now 5 years after the operation I have -0,75 and +0,5.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2006, 03:00</p><p>Big ES fan,to be honest I do believe Nicole has had Lasik - too many diverse references not to be the case.

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2006, 06:14</p><p>Interesting about Nicole Kidman. On GMTV (UK) this morning Ross King made a specific point of mentioning, while showing a clip of Nicole giving her speech, that the reason she looked unsure and nervous was that she could'nt read the autocue without her glasses and therefore had to remember her words. Added that she was too vain to wear them, which I thought was a bit unjust as she has often worn them at similar events in the past. </p><p>Lasik ?

<p><b>Soapman</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2006, 07:21</p><p>Could be that I agree Julian.I always figured that it was something like that in Wonder Woman when Lynda Carter would in one shot be in proper RX and the next in planos. </p><p>However with Corrie a lot of the older cast members wear their own RX glasses seemingly without problem on set so I am not sure. The sudden switch to planos for Claire just seemed a bit odd.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2006, 05:13</p><p>gwgs: The problem is reflections of the many lights on a typical set in the glasses.  The lights are everywhere and reflections are very hard to control if the glasses have anything other than plano surfaces. </p><p>Really good antireflective coatings and maybe polarizing filters would probably help significantly but I don't think the typical director or cinematographer is concernted with our sensibilities.  So they just use plano lenses, carefull camera angles and re-shoot the scene if they get a flash. </p><p>Maybe they need sensitivity training! </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2006, 04:32</p><p>How can it cause the camera man less trouble? Do we think he is an 0-0!? </p><p> </p><p>Claire will probably be doing a bit of GOC :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soapman</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2006, 03:30</p><p>Re Claire in Corrie, its interesting that when the storyline had her needing specs she wore her proper RX ones (she looks to be about a -2.0)However in the last couple of weeks, although her frames are the same, the lenses have been planos. </p><p>Cant really see the point of this unless she has had the dreaded lasik.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alexfan</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2006, 17:22</p><p>Slit, </p><p> </p><p>It's true, about 70% of the USA are hyperopes. One of the main reason, is that Americans are more into reading novels, newspapers, watching TV, and other harmless addictions.  </p><p> </p><p>Therefore, it causes the high rate of hyperopes in US. There are a lot of myopes in Europe, UK and Asia.  </p><p> </p><p>Europeans are freely admitting thier weakness, while Asians hides them. It's just thier lifestyles. </p><p> </p><p>But, with lasik and contact lenses on the rise. Americans are also increasingly becoming myopes by 10% compared to last year, which was 5%. So, basically, we see 5% more myopes each year.  </p><p> </p><p>Technology is to blame for the "boom" of myopes.  </p><p>Even, the Emmy Award and Oscar have posted rules for celebs not to wear glasses on the stage (which I think, it's retarded) </p><p> </p><p>There's nothing wrong with men/women with glasses. It's like wearing stylish dresses, having ears pierced up. So, if they can do that, why can't thier wear glasses too? </p><p> </p><p>You see, this is one of the many reasons why I'm doing research on myopes, because they're often repressed for thier strong prescription. </p><p> </p><p>Stephanie March is a perfect example to begin with. </p><p> </p><p>Any thoughts? </p><p> </p><p>Alexfan. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2006, 04:41</p><p>Here are some screencaps of Denise Quinones from her appearance in the last episode of Smallville. I found them from a site dedicated to Tom Welling (aka Clark Kent). There were only two scenes in the episode where she wore glasses. Below are the most clear photos of her.  </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.tomwelling.org/about_tom/image_gallery/SM-513/popup/180.html" target="_blank">http://www.tomwelling.org/about_tom/image_gallery/SM-513/popup/180.html</a> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.tomwelling.org/about_tom/image_gallery/SM-513/popup/181.html" target="_blank">http://www.tomwelling.org/about_tom/image_gallery/SM-513/popup/181.html</a> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.tomwelling.org/about_tom/image_gallery/SM-513/popup/430.html" target="_blank">http://www.tomwelling.org/about_tom/image_gallery/SM-513/popup/430.html</a> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.tomwelling.org/about_tom/image_gallery/SM-513/popup/431.html" target="_blank">http://www.tomwelling.org/about_tom/image_gallery/SM-513/popup/431.html</a> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.tomwelling.org/about_tom/image_gallery/SM-513/popup/435.html" target="_blank">http://www.tomwelling.org/about_tom/image_gallery/SM-513/popup/435.html</a> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.tomwelling.org/about_tom/image_gallery/SM-513/popup/437.html" target="_blank">http://www.tomwelling.org/about_tom/image_gallery/SM-513/popup/437.html</a> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.tomwelling.org/about_tom/image_gallery/SM-513/popup/443.html" target="_blank">http://www.tomwelling.org/about_tom/image_gallery/SM-513/popup/443.html</a> </p><p> </p><p>The second scene is interesting. Denise comes out of a phone booth in the office in Daily Planet, where she had taken off her superhero suit. Then she puts her bag on the table and takes out of it a box of acuvue contact lenses and her glasses case. Chloe tells her, "I thought the glasses were fake", and Denise replies to her as she slowly puts on her glasses, "Are you kidding? I am blind as a bat. Besides the glasses don't look so good with the mask over it". And then Chloe comments, "Acuvue to rescue."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alexfan</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2006, 23:50</p><p>I'll have to disagree. Look at the 4th picture, the last one. It shows *a lot* of cut-in, and Stephanie's edge of face can be seen in her glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>I'm thinking it could be -2.50 or -3.00.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>still</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2006, 21:05</p><p>Alexfan, my guess is not stronger than -1.50.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2006, 20:40</p><p>On Smallville last night, Denise Quinones wore glasses for part of the episode and looked GREAT.  She played a daily planet reporter who wore glasses to conceal her identity of a superheroine named the Angel of Vengeance.  Hopefully someone has screencaps.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>spexfan</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2006, 04:37</p><p>I simply want to welcome you to this site. I like your zeal. I'm sure you'll find some tidbits from time to time which are helpful and best of luck. I might post something to 'sightings' in light of this.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alexfan</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2006, 23:10</p><p>Perhaps, a prescription of -2.50D is a good estimate. Again, it's all estimage and guesses. I needed to see the fact. Here's the thing. I'm a graphic designer doing a huge research project on glasses vs. contact lenses, and lasik vs. glasses </p><p>I'm also conducting a survey on several specs wearers, and some "glasses" obsessions like this one here.  </p><p> </p><p>Basically, my point is being whether it's important for glasses wearers to still wear glasses, or balance them with contact lenses, or how much/should they wear in regard to thier prescription. </p><p> </p><p>In that case, at this moment...my focus is on Stephanie March. Next is Julia Roberts, and gradually Sandra Bullock. (it's rather a long project, a 5 mths. project...definately, I needed detials) </p><p> </p><p>I've been told that since they are actresses, I do not have any direct access to gain thier valid facts, but I could "open-research" meaning finding clues from anywhere, like talking or responding with you...etc </p><p>and from there, I'll see where the fact information comes from. </p><p> </p><p>On a personal note, I, too wear glasses and have a moderate to severe astigmatism. My prescription is higher than Stephanie March, given the estimates here. So, I imagine that when I was younger, I had her prescription. And I could tell, it wasn't bad either, but yes, it would be better to see with it clearly. </p><p> </p><p>Mmmm...I'll have to do more "fact" checking. It's important these days, I believe on the rise since the James Frey controversy with Oprah.  </p><p> </p><p>Alright, I would appreciate anymore support or help if you have any lead on Stephanie March or how I could find true/fact information from. It could be a website, a link to magazine, or etc... </p><p> </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Alexfan.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ree</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2006, 09:44</p><p>  I agree with Specs4ever.   She has that perfect prescription where she dosent always need her glasses to see clearly.  People with that sort of prescription have the liberty of wearing and taking off their glasses when ever they want without facing much difficulty, and maybe some like Stephanie there can also use them like accessories to enhance their looks or play with them to get the desired effect.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2006, 07:16</p><p>I would suggest that she is no more than a -2.50D. This is really a perfect prescription, as she does not need glasses to read, but yet she gets to wear them to accent her beauty. She is a great looking gal wearing glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ree</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2006, 02:01</p><p>Alexfan,  I agree that Stephanie is really one cool GWG.  But her Rx is nowhere  near the point where she is blind without them,  or has to have them as must to see anything. </p><p>     My estimate is that she has a decent moderate to low Rx which shows a bit of cut in,  but she is definitely not highly myopic.  She is still at a stage where she can very well manage with her glasses on top of her head, but definitely sees much clearly with them on. </p><p>     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2006, 03:22</p><p>Celebrity BB last night focused on Jodie taking out her contacts before going to bed. They were obviously not disposables as she spent time rinsing them with a bottle of lens cleaner &amp; then held the lens holder close to her face as she stored them away. </p><p>She then picked up her glasses (which she wore for hours yesterday), wiped them on her skirt, held them up &amp; then put them on. </p><p>She then got into bed &amp; lay there with her glasses on until the camera switched to another subject. </p><p>Her glasses look around minus 5 to me - she obviously needs some kind of correction at all times. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2006, 02:54</p><p>Guy's....Alam was wearing them all the time she was having lunch yesterday, a lot of close ups as well. Funny as the only other time Ive seen her wearing them was at breakfast on the first day, perhaps she just likes to see clearly what she is eating !! </p><p>There is incidentally a small pic in todays Daily Mirror with her wearing them. </p><p>Quite agree though that she is pretty boring, not that interesting, with or without specs</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2006, 00:55</p><p>Have to agree with you on this Luc, another day passed and it's another without seeing the increasingly irritating Alam, without glasses. </p><p> </p><p>On the other hand though, it was another with Jodie Marsh wearing spex, they even had a still of her wearing them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>CircleBox</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2006, 18:57</p><p>Not sure if this has already been brought up but I recently watched The Interpreter starring Nicole Kidman and there were many scenes in which she wore glasses, generally while she was reading. It isn't until the end of the movie that you get a good close up look of her with the glasses on and you can see that the lenses cut into her face which leads me to believe that they were real glasses with plus lenses. However, I thought Nicole had lasik eye surgery. Correct me if I am wrong!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lazysiow</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2005, 00:06</p><p>They look plano to me. I think they are just for show. Ironically when she needed glasses she had to do all her movies half blind, but now that she's had lasik, she's doing speccy roles?  </p><p> </p><p>what gives lol</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NYC O^O</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2005, 20:21</p><p>Courtney Cox had Lasik a few years ago. She had been moderately myopic at least -3.00 or -4.00. Is she now regressing slightly? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2005, 17:23</p><p>I just saw the movie "November" where Courtney Cox wears glasses. The movie doesn't have much to offer. For a low budget thriller it's adequate. If you don't like movies that need thinking, then don't watch it. Now, concerning Courtney Cox, she wears glasses for the whole movie. She takes them off and puts them back on about two or three times. In some scenes they seem to be without prescription and in some others they seem to be very low minus. The frames are a bit old, but with the lighting that was used in the movie, they seem pretty cool. Anyway, the glasses were totally worth watching the movie.</p><p></p><hr>

Unfortunately for her many admirers there were only two relatively small screen captures. From previous posts here, pics are hard to find. Which brings me to my request of perhaps making our own! </p><p> </p><p>I found a decent size front-on pic of her, and with your skills on photoshop (or whatever program you use), you could dress her in a few frames - like what you did for Natalie Portman. </p><p> </p><p>Hopefully this may satisfy our apetites while we await more authentic photos of Elisabeth.  </p><p> </p><p>Let me know if your interested and I'll forward you the link of her photo and some suggestions as to the type of frames. </p><p> </p><p>Also, if I was to include the links to a picture of a phoropter and trial frame, is there any chance you could show us her in action during her eye exam?? Geez, I would love to sit in on her.... phoropter positioned in front of her, eyes aligned with the eyeholes, watching her focus on the eyechart, while the opto dials in the increasingly stronger lenses she deserves!!

<p><b>Hollie</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2005, 15:59</p><p>It's a real life programme they show in the mornings of a couple of hospitals in London (can't remember the ones offhand). I think you're mixing it up with Holby City (a fictional programme, spin-off from Casualty).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2005, 14:13</p><p>But City Hospital is a story, not like it's real life. If she wore them in a soap opera it doesn't mimic real life</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2005, 10:04</p><p>Nadia does wear glasses and contacts. The other day on city hospital she wore them cos she had an eye infection. A while back she was joking around doing an eye test and said 'i've cheated cos i have my contacts in'. She makes out she's pretty blind - but wouldn't say her prescription was that high!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nicola</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2005, 09:27</p><p>She occasionally wears them on that awful learner driving programme, which is so bad that an occasional glimpse of Nadia in her glasses doesn't really compensate.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hollie</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2005, 16:12</p><p>I've heard Nadia Sawalha on City Hospital (daytime BBC programme) refer to the fact she wears contacts a couple of times....never seen her in glasses though...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;04 Nov 2005, 11:04</p><p>Must be a family trait gwgs. I never knew her sister Nadia was a GWG but in a low budget day time show a few months back where she was learning to drive she wore glasses when driving which seemed to show a minus prescription, maybe around -2.0.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;04 Nov 2005, 09:23</p><p>Just thought I'd point out something I hadn't noticed before; </p><p> </p><p>I was watching Absolutely Fabulous the other night, the g/f remarked "something for both of us on this show" (she knows I like 0-0's). </p><p> </p><p>I was watching Saffy closely, who is played by Julia Sawalia, who wears glasses full time on the show, nice gold rimmed bookish spex and saw a decent bit of cut in. </p><p> </p><p>I originally thought they were just props but it is now evident that her props are prescription glasses! In all the scenes on this particular episode I paused the shots of her and I was very pleased to see a notable prescription. </p><p> </p><p>The strange thing is in all of her of other shows shes never worn glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Now either she was doing GOC (this was back in the 90's though) or she's another one who's had Lasik.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>oscar</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2005, 05:46</p><p>Charles â she used to be on the BBC "Doctor Who" series in the very early 1970s. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Charles</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2005, 02:45</p><p>Not being a very keen TV viewer, I have never heard of Katy Manning but she sounds great. What shows is she on? I would love to catch a glimpse.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2005, 00:25</p><p>Just did a search for Katy Manning and unfortunately didn't find any pix but it is heavily documented that she had/has appaling eyesight and I'm dying to see some photos of her with these THICK spex; </p><p> </p><p>"As the Master leads Jo by the hand across the rock-strewn ground of the Ogrons' planet, he can be heard quietly saying various un-Master-esque things like, "Be careful down here." </p><p>[This is not so much the Master helping Jo as Roger Delgado helping out Katy Manning, whose poor eyesight (without her glasses) left her prone to tripping up on uneven terrain.]" </p><p> </p><p>Another one; </p><p> </p><p>"Katy is very nearly blind, even with contact lenses in, so it took a minute or two to arrange the materials so that she could see the constellations and houses on the main chart. She did pop on her reading specs for the first part of the discussion, just to see some of the finer points of the chart. It was engaging to see the spritely face of the woman we all associate with Jo Grant, reading glasses perched down on her nose, trying to see me over the tops of them to talk to me."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2005, 00:17</p><p>RE: Billie Piper, it might be worth mentioning that she doesn't wear spex in Dr Who, in fact, I haven't seen her wearing them for some years.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>oscar</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2005, 17:37</p><p>Ah, the very, very lovely Katy Manning. She was indeed blind as a bat. I did find a picture or two of her from much more recent years with her wearing reading glasses over her contact. Her prescription was/is amazingly high and she once (just once) appeared on TV on an antiques programme in the 1970s wearing large frames with myodiscs in them (only the second time I had ever seen them on anyone). She kept taking them off as well, but they were seriously strong. I doubt if there are any photos of her wearing them, but I remember a feature in the Radio Times around 1970 where she talked about how difficult it was for her on the set because she was so severely myopic.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopeinhere</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2005, 15:54</p><p>And another thing,Katy Manning who played Jo grant in the 1970's in the dodgy series was an amazing myope,blind as a bat but cannot find pictures of her anywhere in glasses. </p><p>perhaps there's an OO on the production staff?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Karen X</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2005, 13:52</p><p>Billie Piper is a former teen pop star and is now an actress. Her acting is actually quite good (much better than her singing). She is currently playing Rose in "Dr Who". Dr Who is a British Sci-Fi/Family Drama about a 'Timelord' (only known as The Dr) who travels through time and space saving various planets and their inhabitants from their enemies. Dr Who first appeared on BBC TV in the early 1960s and ran until the late 1980s with several different actors playing the Dr over the years. It was well known for it's low budget special effects and dodgy looking sets. In the mid 1990s a fairly average quality US/UK co-production tv movie was made. Then, in Spring this year, the BBC showed its new series. This series had a big budget and amazing special effects. Carrying on the tradition of all previous series Billie Piper was cast as the human assistant to the Dr (The Dr is actually an alien who looks human). Most of the Assistants over the years have been female (some cute, some sexy). The new series attracted more viewers than any other programme on any other UK channel at the same time. There is going to be a Christmas Special in late December and another series next year. Billie remains as the assistant. Even though "Dr Who" is aimed at families there are regular more adult suggestive comments and jokes that children don't notice. It's very good drama worth watching! By the way I am NOT a sci-fi geek and do Not work for the BBC!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Philosifer</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2005, 14:54</p><p>Spent a pleasant couple of hours last night watching the 'new'  Nicole Kidman movie - The Interpreter (finally out on DVD). Not a great flick, though quite entertaining for an OO. She wore her glasses for perhaps half the time, and there was no doubt about the fact that they were real. Not strong; but enough cut-in for maybe -2 or -3 on the right eye and a bit less on the left.  I believe I heard she has done the Lasik thing since; can anyone confirm that ? The irritating thing, though was that they had her taking them off and putting them on at all the wrong moments - as if the only reason the Director could imagine anyone needing glasses was to read. So she was always putting them on for near work, and taking them off for distance vision !   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2005, 00:29</p><p>Well said Mav. </p><p> </p><p>One thing i have noticed on WW is that every single driving scene shows her wearing drop temple tinted spex that clearly show a myopic prescription, and at certain times, a great cut in. </p><p> </p><p>My question to add to Philosifers is why did she change to the planos? Why not keep these on all the time?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2005, 14:51</p><p>The answer to 2, Philosofer, is apparently that 'no' she did not wear CL's on set. </p><p>In her commentary on the WW series DVD currently available Lynda Carter makes reference to the fact that her vision was so bad without glasses that she needed sandbags placed round the set as 'marks'. </p><p>In many ways it seems bizarre that she mostly wore planos when in character as Diana Prince when she obviously needed RX specs and looked great in them. I can only assume that there was some problem in indoor scenes with lighting reflections that made planos a technically better option.  </p><p> For me noone even comes close to Ms Carter as my all time favourit GWG.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Philosifer</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2005, 14:29</p><p>I keep going back to that set of Diana Prince, aka Wonder Woman, pictures. </p><p>They are spectacular, in their own right, showing as they do a beautiful, intelligent , woman with clearly significant Rx. There are a couple of pics, #34 and 35, I think, that highlight far better than  even maximum cut-in on an standard face shot, the fascinating distortional effects of a medium myopic lens; I just love those. But the really intriguing questions, and I know they been asked before (but not satisfactorily answered) , are: </p><p>1) why an actress who evidently needs to wear 'proper' glasses with a significant prescription would, much of the time, wear clearly plano theatrical specs ? and; </p><p>2) when she was wearing that slightly dumb-looking theatre prop pair, did she have contacts in, so she could actually see where she was going ? </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://albums.photo.epson.com/j/ViewPhoto?u=4231226&amp;a=31664795&amp;p=72537267&amp;f=0" target="_blank">http://albums.photo.epson.com/j/ViewPhoto?u=4231226&amp;a;=31664795&amp;p;=72537267&amp;f;=0</a> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2005, 15:58</p><p>I have just watched the first episode of a new comedy on BBC2 (UK) called "Supernova". The first scene had the main character (played by Rob Brydon) being interviewed by a 30 something woman wearing a business suit. She was wearing glasses with thick black frames and I'm pretty sure they had a minus prescription in the lenses. This women is very sexy and is played by Australian actress Kat Stewart. </p><p>Unfortunately the next time we see her character she is not wearing glasses but she is wearing some casual close fitting clothes that show off her great figure. The character is a Dr in science working in an observatory in the Australian outback. She didn't wear her glasses for the rest of the episode. </p><p>I'm hoping she will wear her glasses in future episodes. </p><p>If anyone knows of this actress (she has done quite a bit of tv &amp; theatre in Australia) and has any photos of her please post a link to them. </p><p>She is on the right in this picture (no glasses though) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/supernova/gallery/gallery5.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/supernova/gallery/gallery5.shtml</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Vinegar Joe</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2005, 03:53</p><p>Actually, Tyra Banks does wear glasses with a real RX. She was in a Jeopardy Celebrity Tourney a few years ago, and she wore some fashionable metal frames during the whole tourney. Very nice. :) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2005, 00:06</p><p>If you look closely at the second photo of Tyra Banks it looks like there a bit of prescription in the LH lens. Could these be real glasses as opposed to the plano "model shoot" kind?? </p><p> </p><p>I think the last photo is her best. That black plastic frame is unreal!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2005, 21:56</p><p>I actually find Elisabeth more attractive with her glasses on than off. That black square plastic frame suits her perfectly and looks stunning with her blond hair.  </p><p> </p><p>I don't know if these are new glasses but they appear to be of slightly different shape to her others (see here <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://us.f3.yahoofs.com/users/427cef54z4776b03/acef/__sr_/b1f6.jpg?phLgMPDB0QhGgTkI" target="_blank">http://us.f3.yahoofs.com/users/427cef54z4776b03/acef/__sr_/b1f6.jpg?phLgMPDB0QhGgTkI</a>  ) </p><p> </p><p>Her "old" ones seem to be a bit deeper and thus slightly too large for her face IMO. </p><p> </p><p>Elisabeth's frames also have some great sidearms on them. They are the really fat kind and she often pulls her hair back to expose this feature. </p><p> </p><p>In regards to her lenses, I'd have a guess that they are around -4. A close look at the edges appear to give off a decent amount of minus and reflectivity. I think she's been a GWG for some time.

She is a truly great but little known actress who chooses her parts and films carefully. Glad to see her finally as a GWG, even if its only in film. Really hot choice of semi-rimless plastic frames too!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>kisal</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2005, 11:56</p><p>I just got back from the movies and here is one I would definitely recommend, both because it is a great film, and mostly because it features one of the best GWG on film I have seen in a long while.  Sadly, the scene is short, but she is awesome!  The actress is Chloë Sevigny, who I had not heard of, but apparently she is a famous model and has been in a number of films.  Great legs too! </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, the film stars Bill Murray and Chloë's scene is in the middle.  So go see it or better rent it when it comes out on DVD so you can replay the scene. </p><p> </p><p>Oh, and I almost forgot, here she is: </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://outnow.ch/Media/Img/2005/BrokenFlowers/movie.1/10.jpg?w=1400&amp;h=915" target="_blank">http://outnow.ch/Media/Img/2005/BrokenFlowers/movie.1/10.jpg?w=1400&amp;h;=915</a> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2005, 12:23</p><p>A bit more on Lynda Carter and her glasses in Wonder Woman. </p><p>The following is a comment I picked up off the web from someone referring to LC's commentary on the currently available WW full series DVD's. </p><p> </p><p> "I am surprised they didn't give her real glasses, because Carter says in the commentary that her vision was so bad without glasses that she had to have sand bags as "marks" in some scenes." </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2005, 05:30</p><p>Thanks for the pics Speximan.Personally I dont think she wore CL's behind the plano glasses she was normally seen in  a Diana Prince. If she was wearing CL's on set it does'nt make sense for her to have to switch to RX glasses for driving scenes.  </p><p>My guess is that her RX is around -3.0 and she could 'get by' OK except when having to drive. </p><p>The annoying thing about WW is that having given the role,( where in character, wearing glasses was a requirement), to a glasses wearing actress they had her wearing planos most of the time.....just nuts ! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2005, 16:47</p><p>Linda Carter! I haven't heard about her in over 20 years. As TV's Wonder Woman / Daina Prince she wore glasses in that show. Linda has to wear Rx glasses in real life. Sometimes her charactor had on plano glasses and Linda had on her contact lenses. At other times she wore her Rx glasses, often both pairs in the same episode as both pairs were of the same frame style. So the only way to tell is to look carefully at her lenses. Linda also did TV commercials for B&amp;L; softlens contacts in the 1970's when they first came on the market.  I wonder if she got LASIK? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ex/optician</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2005, 11:34</p><p>my guess is -3,reg plastic lenses + the huge eyesize indeed-these large styles are coming back and they will much better this time -i'll be looking for them in vegas at vision expo in sept!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;16 Aug 2005, 20:00</p><p>We have discussed Lynda Cater from Wonder Woman several times here. We know she wears glasses. We also know alot of the glasses she wore on the show either wasn't her correct RX or they didn't have any at all. BUT, later in the second season &amp; third season when she was driving, she wore a different pair. These glasses were presumably her own avaitor style frames with noticable lens deflection. </p><p>    I have an album of pix "Dianna Prince" <a

<p><b></b>&nbsp;14 Aug 2005, 11:07</p><p>Does anyone know Jessica Alba's Rx? How can she function without correction? If she doesn't want to wear glasses why did she also stop wearing contacts? What is behind her refusal to wear correction? Does she think she shouldn't have to wear correction now that she is "JESSICA ALBA",  I am to sexy for my skirt? Or does she just want to piss off her mum. Squinting causes eye fatigue, tripping over or walking into things and always asking the person next to you to read something or asking them "who's that standing over there" makes you a pain to be around. I once knew a girl who would not wear her glasess and was always asking someone to see for her. She stopped this when we would say back to her "were is your white cane". She still would not wear her glasses but she would carry them with her and would put them on for a second to see then she was quick to take them off again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2005, 11:20</p><p>Yes gwgs the Claire storyline has been interesting for us OO's ! </p><p>The actress who plays her was a full time GWG before joining the Street and I suppose it could be that she was not happy wearing CL's on set and got the writers to introduce a storyline that allowed her to start wearing her glasses whilst in character. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2005, 06:05</p><p>Got these off Coronation Street a couple of nights ago, Claire wears spex full time and has done for a few months. In these couple of months she has already changed her glasses twice, and in this episode she gets into a fight with another girl who proceeds to stamp on her spex! </p><p> </p><p>For those who think they are plano - which i guessed there would be a few - i deliberately did some shots showing cut in and magnification. </p><p> </p><p>I loved the moment before this as you see her spex falling off and she goes to grab them and put them back on but the other girl squashes them with her handbag. I think her reaching for the spex was a real reaction considering they her glasses weren't props.

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2005, 21:09</p><p>    To Guest: There are 2 movies that pair Ed Marinaro &amp; Connie Selleca one from 93 "Passport to Murder" or "Doomsday Rock" 97,where she plays an astronamer-scientists daughter. I have 1 cap from that movie posted somewhere.The other have never seen but would love to video cap it. just starting to copy video sections of movies but not sure how to assemble them as clips to post yet. If you would like for me to capture &amp; clean up the still frames from this, I would love to, as well as copy the clips but don't know how long it will take to do the video thing. If interested contact speximann426@yahoo.com </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2005, 18:02</p><p>Great site, BTW. I have on video, Connie Selleca in a TV movie ... I have no idea the title, circa approx. 1995. Her co-star is Ed Marinaro of Hill Street Blues fame. Connie wears her real RX glasses in most of the movie ... at some point she wakes up from a sleep and squints to find the table her glasses are on ... Outstanding stuff. </p><p>I would like to put the short tape in the hands of someone here that could post the clips for all of us to enjoy. </p><p>Any ideas. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>foureyes</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2005, 16:01</p><p>I remember Connie Selleca wearing glasses on Hotel. I was kind of thinking of cases where the character getting or starting to wear glasses was actually mentioned as part of the storyline. I don't remember that in this case but I could be wrong.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ChrisB</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2005, 16:43</p><p>I have just been watching a DVD of a US tv series (Fox) 'Arrested Development' Apart from being hilariously funny some of the episodes feature the actress Judy Greer as 'Kitty the secretary' and who always wears glasses (with quite a significant RX). I have not seen Judy Greer mentioned in this thread and a scan thro her pictures linked to IMDB shows her bare eyed. She was also in 13 going on 30, with Jennifer Garner and I am almost certain there were pix of both of them on the special features of that DVD wearing glasses as teenagers?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2005, 23:23</p><p>I must respectfully disagree with Noodles regarding Elisabeth Hasselbeck. Having seen her in glasses a number of times on The View as well as in episodes of Survivor there is a very obvious Rx in her lenses. I'm no expert but I would conservatively estimate it to be at least -3 to -4. Anybody else care to guess?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>noodles</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2005, 18:55</p><p>...Glasses on women these days are perceived to give an added sense of sophistication and sexiness to the wearer. So cool are they that some women (including celebrities) have confessed to wearing specs as a fashion statement despite their vision being perfect. </p><p> </p><p>I think Elisabeth is one of these fashion conscious women. She is a beautiful woman who looks stunning in a heavy frame. She probably thinks so too, or why else would she wear them! She wants to be able to say "I wear glasses", but, more than likely, an eye exam revealed she has no requirement for corrective lenses (or a very weak Rx). Not to be out done, she reveals a very noticeable frame, possibly to hide the fact she focuses through plano lenses.  </p><p> </p><p>My opinion is she only appears four-eyed where most people see her on the TV show, The View. Perhaps the show's producers have even told her to wear specs in an attempt to boost ratings and/or her appeal. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe she does need the "fashion frames" to read the teleprompter, but if this is the case what does she use to correct her vision when not bespectacled?? I find it hard to believe she would choose contacts over specs in the morning! </p><p> </p><p>I think you'll find her vision does not require the glasses. Having said all that, she is one of the best examples of a celebrity in glasses and should be encouraged to wear them more often. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>noodles</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2005, 18:43</p><p>There are a few (literally 2) photos of Elisabeth Hasselbeck wearing a pair of thick black specs which give her a sophisticated image. A very bold frame selection which she obviously likes the look of, even exposing the heavy sidearms by pulling back her hair. </p><p> </p><p>The fact that she looks so great in glasses and wears them so infrequently, got me wondering weather they are real. Does Elisabeth REQUIRE glasses?  </p><p> </p><p>I've been searching the web trying to find any details about her vision and have found nothing. It's hard to tell weather there is any  correction in those lenses of hers. As a result I have come to my own conclusion....  </p><p></p><hr>

A phoropter is used to determine your level of farsightedness, nearsightedness, astigmatism and presbyopia and therefore strength of corrective lenses It is a large "mask like" instrument that houses all possible corrective lenses. It is positioned in front of your eyes (like a big set of binoculars) and you view through a series of different lens choices. The doctor will ask which lens selection is better. Based on your answers, the doctor will continue to fine-tune your power until reaching a final prescription that provides you with the clearest vision. </p><p> </p><p>Look familiar </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.optometrists.asn.au/freestyler/gui/files/phoropter-sample.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.optometrists.asn.au/freestyler/gui/files/phoropter-sample.jpg</a> </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.laserforyou.com/images/PtatPhoropter.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.laserforyou.com/images/PtatPhoropter.jpg</a> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>So Speximann, any chance of some actresses gazing through the phoropter or trial frame??</p><p></p><hr>

In the past, there were several people who seemed a little pissed because they were posted here. They weren't intended to fool anyone, &amp; I didn't know where else to post this type of thing.  I will be happy to make another gallery of fakes if anyone would like, as this has turned into a fun little hobby inside a very infatuating subject line. Also see the earlier post of Dianne Krugger Fakes posted a few weeks back as someone requested.

<p><b>Therouteur</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2005, 15:48</p><p>A very interesting post. I know the question of OOs comes up fairly often and I'd be interested to hear other people's nominations for other OOs. My nomination is John Lennon. He was one of the first rock stars to wear his glasses in public. His first wife was a gwg. His mistress in the 70s, May Pang was also a gwg. Any thoughts?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2005, 10:59</p><p>While checking out Google's print search, I came across this excerpt from the book _Hitchcock and Selznick_: </p><p> </p><p>"Hitchcock would periodically have an optician bring a large selection of frames to the studio and insist that secretary-business manager Carol Stevens choose 4 or 5 pair. 'And if I came on the set without my glasses on, it irritated the devil out of Hitch. He had a fetish about glasses.'"</p><p></p><hr>

They can make a real fashion statement or transform an understated outfit to create a really striking look.'  </p><p> </p><p>Penny also thinks men look great in specs, one in particular, boyfriend Rod Stewart. The veteran rocker often parades around at home in a pair of glasses - to enhance his girlfriend's desires for him. 'I like to see Rod in a nice pair of glasses, he really suits them. They add a sense of mystery and sex appeal.'  </p><p> </p><p>Check out some photos of this hot blonde in some specs for the cameras.

<p><b>pelegrino</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2005, 05:47</p><p>I couldn't figure out her RX, but I think she's slightly hyperopic. I just say that, because on some fotos from the side one couldn't see any rings typical for myopics, therefor I'd say she's hyperopic. Also on some fotos with the white background, one could see the reflection of the glasses, which you don't find with myopic glasses. That's just my guess. Correct me if I'm wrong (I don't hope so though, for I prefere hyperopics  ;-) </p><p>greetings </p><p> </p><p>pelegrino</p><p></p><hr>

Her frame selection of an all acetate design with thick sidearms is particularly bold. While the slimline rectangular lenses and slight catseye shape add a sophisticated feminine touch. She obviously likes the stylish angularities on the edges and chunky sidearms, choosing to expose these features by pulling back her hair. </p><p> </p><p>It's quite rare to see a female celebrity reveal such noticeable eyewear, but Erica appears so confident in the photos, knowing that she looks so hot! </p><p> </p><p>Does anyone know anything about this four-eyed beauty?

<p><b>big ES fan</b>&nbsp;26 May 2005, 06:58</p><p>Speximann, </p><p>Bo Derek wears a decent plus prescription, around +4? She is wearing them in "Ghosts Can't Do It" (1990) in a short scene at a lawyers office. She looks very stunning in them, they are designer frames and John Derek lists the provider in the final credits. The movie is a dog but it's worth watching just to see her. It's not available on DVD or I would try to get a decent screen cap, although it is available on VHS.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>big ES fan</b>&nbsp;16 May 2005, 07:36</p><p>Steve, </p><p>Your question is a hard one, there are so many beautiful actresses with glasses. I would have to say Sherilyn Fenn. Sightings of her in glasses are rare, but she did a Showtime short a few years ago wearing at least -3.50 and she was gorgeous! She has to be one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen, so you can imangine what she looked like in glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;19 Apr 2005, 20:13</p><p>Any news about Stephanie Mcmahon? I read in one of her bio data that she wears glasses!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;19 Apr 2005, 15:59</p><p>I remember having seen Connie Selleca on one epsiode of P.S.I. Luv U (the 1991 TV series), wearing what must have been her real glasses. The prescription looked similar to those on the 1977 photo.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>big ES fan</b>&nbsp;19 Apr 2005, 07:27</p><p>The day I picked up the brochure with the photo of Connie, was in the spring of 1977, at a Pearl Vision Center. My wife and I had gone in to pick up an almost identical pair for her with -4.25 in each eye with some mild cylinder, under -1. I did'nt know who the girl was then, but I commented to my wife about the similarity of the glasses. I thought Connies looked a little stronger, slightly more cut in, but you have to take into account they are setting down on her nose a little too far. They obviously did that on purpose to sell contact lenses. I've always thought they were between -4.25 and -5.00. I looked up Connie on imdb.com and they give her birthday as May 25, 1955, which would have made her 21 or 22 years old. Just guessing I think it would be reasonable to assume that after wearing soft lenses for the last 26 or 27 years, her prescription could have easily more than doubled. This is all guess work but I thought some of you might find it interesting. Guessing and talking about these things is what makes Eye Scene so enjoyable.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2005, 18:35</p><p>Dave, thanks to you also.  To me that ad is so contrived and manipulative, i.e. the big glasses a little down the nose and Connie's glum expression versus her happier and more assertive look in pic2, that I don't expect those are her real glasses...

<p><b>big ES fan</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2005, 12:09</p><p>I found the brochure of Connie Selleca from about 1977. It's an advertisement promoting Bausch &amp; Lomb polymacon contact lenses. This was before she became a well known actress and was doing ads. I scanned it in jpeg format, file size about 325kb. I would be glad to e-mail the photo to one person who could post it somewhere. I don't use any of the online photo services. Just guessing I would say the time I saw her on TV, probably 4 or 5 years ago, that her precription had doubled, maybe even more. After it was too late, I wished I had recorded the show. If anyone wants it just post an e-mail address and I will gladly send it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2005, 11:27</p><p>Linda Carter is very myopic, I've seen her with her real glasses and they are very strong.  I would agree with the -8 or more.  In the "Wonder Woman" series, she normally wore planos in varying large frame styles, but occasionally she would wear her own.  Not often enough for my liking.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guido</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2005, 11:15</p><p>Lynda Carter is not a -8.  There is a video clip of her on the net where she is starting a car, I think from a Wonder Woman episode.  She puts on the glasses in the clip and they are minus, but I do not think -8.  The lens size likely makes them appear stronger.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>big ES fan</b>&nbsp;17 Apr 2005, 20:00</p><p>Don, </p><p> </p><p>Connie Selleca was on a TV show where her husband played a trick on her at home, with cameras waiting outside. I can't remember the name of the show but they caught her outside with her glasses on. High index, plano, unbievable power rings and cutin. I would say at least -12 or better. I will try to find a photo of her that I picked up at a vision center in 1977 on a contact lens brochure. Her lenses were strong, but 20 years later they had progressed quite abit. If I find the brochure I will mail it to someone that can post it. The girl in, Stranger On A Train, said in an interview that Hitch made her wear the strongest glasses that they had and she could'nt see a thing. I think Hitch was probably an OO. </p><p></p><hr>

She is extremely myopic and appeared a long time ago (about 20 years at least) on a TV antiques programme wearing her lovely myodisc glasses.

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;11 Apr 2005, 15:29</p><p>My memory is as fallible as the next man, and I've never been a fan of Coronation St, but I seem to remember Deirdre wearing plus lenses before she went over to planos (presumably on top of contacts).  Am I quite mistaken?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;11 Apr 2005, 12:25</p><p>Apart from very early in her Corrie career Deidre (Anne Kirkbride) has always worn planos. Quite why I'm not sure as virtually every other glasses wearer that has appeared in the soap over the years has worn their own prescription. </p><p> I recall seeing an early pic of her sometime back where she was wearing her specs, and from memory think they looked to be in the region of -2.5 to -3.0</p><p></p><hr>

Anyone have a guess as to her RX, she seems to have worn them all the time for years but I have failed to notice any RX there at all and am convinced they are either plano or ridiculously small minus?!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>still</b>&nbsp;09 Apr 2005, 08:26</p><p>Nah. She has planos. I note that they have her glasses done so that they are highly reflective, no doubt to make up for the lack of prescription. They also seem to darken in brighter ambiance, probably for the same reason. What's not clear is why they have started using glasses - she never had them in the earlier episodes in which she had a part.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guido</b>&nbsp;09 Apr 2005, 01:35</p><p>Recently, Kristin Chenoweth, on The West Wing has appeared wearing glasses.  She's the extremely short aid whose voice I find irritating.  They never give a long enough shot of her to pick up whether the specs are real or likely props.  Interestingly, I did an IMDB search on her and her bio indicates that she has recorded an album and is vocally talented.  Could'a fooled me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2005, 14:29</p><p>Interesting storyline in the current Coronation Street UK soap where young Clare - Ashleys wife - finds she is short-sighted and in tonights episode got glasses and goes full time straight off. Not planos either, proper prescription.Dodgy frames though, large plastic. </p><p>There was a scene in the pub where Ashley is saying he finds her glasses very attractive and Tyrone says to girlfriend Maria (Samia Ghadie) who is with them 'you should get some glasses' . Oh I wish !! </p><p>I posted here a while back that a dream storyline for Corrie would be for Maria who is a real babe, to get glasses - perhaps the producers read this board !!</p><p></p><hr>

Check tv listings for next programme in series. </p><p>Abi Titmuss wore glasses briefly in a pre-recorded sketch in the "Friday Night Project" (Channel 4 in UK). It is repeated tonight at 11:25pm. If anyone in the UK can do some screen/video captures of Abi in glasses and make them available on a website I'm sure many Eyscene visitors would be extremely grateful, myself included. (For those who don't know Abi Titmuss is a petite, large breasted, cute blonde who is famous in Britain for having an affair with a married tv presenter. She is a tv presenter/personality now herself.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Karen X</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2005, 14:34</p><p>Jo Guest was featured on last nights edition of "Extreme Celebrity Detox" on Channel 4. She is one of a small group of 'celebrities' on a detox course in a very remote rainforest. She was wearing metal frame glasses with what appeared to be a minus prescription. Not a very strong prescription but obviously strong enough for her to want to wear her glasses full-time. </p><p>One of the other celebs was comedienne/actress Mina Anwar ("Goodness Gracious Me", "The Kumars..") who also wore glasses most of the time. </p><p>The final part of the programme is on tonight at 11:05pm and should feature Jo and Mina again. The programme also featured other groups of celebs in other part of the world on their detox courses. Be warned - this programme is likely to show clips from the first 3 programmes. Some of the detox activities included cleansing the stomach by drinking 3litres of warm water and vomitting it back up, and nasal cavity flossing - sticking a narrow rubber tube town the throat via the nose and out of the mouth to floss like you would floss your teeth. It sounds bad but looks much worse (just how many times do we need to see somone sticking their fingers down their throat and vomit up water?)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrisb</b>&nbsp;02 Feb 2005, 14:55</p><p>Wow, Jennifer Garner in series 4! FaNaTiKX I only just got to see Alias series 1 and 2. I think Ms Garner is seriously under represented in the GWG pantheon. The producers of Alias use   spex as a major element in the disguises and in a couple of the episodes you could almost think she might be wearing a real RX. Anyone know if she is a real GWG? I will try following the advice posted earlier and get some screen caps from series 1 &amp; 2. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

She was wearing some contemporary cat-eye frames and a mild minus script as near as I can tell.  Dennis made reference to her appearance saying something about his fantasy of a substitute teacher.  I am not familiar with any of the shows on which she appeared or currently appears.  I did attempt some captures but they ended up being of such poor quality thet I will not post them.

<p><b>Joe90</b>&nbsp;07 Sep 2004, 02:13</p><p>Hi </p><p>Not sure as you never know what you hear or read is true. Ms Hannah did say in an interview on TV - must have been about 10 years ago that she wore her own glasses in the movies Roxanne and Steel Magnolias. I think it was on TV-AM. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;07 Sep 2004, 00:57</p><p>Any chance of some caps from Gingerbread man, or will i have to buy it?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2004, 18:12</p><p>I would guess it's an odd one - she mentions having trouble seeing without them, and +2 simply isn't that severe.  I'd wager there's some cylinder in there, which I find hard to gauge in plus lenses.  She shore is purdy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Karen X</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2004, 14:46</p><p>Does anyone have a rough idea of Kate Beckinsale's prescripton?

<p><b>Andy</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2004, 22:53</p><p>Wurm I don't think the story behind these famous glasses Laura Elliott aka Kasey Rogers wore in "Strangers on a train" is true. I remember coming across a page on the Internet where in an Interview Mrs. Elliott/Rogers reported, that Mr. Hitchkock had several pairs of glasses made for the movie. Mrs. Elliott/Rogers stated that she couldn't see a thing when she wore those glasses. She described the scene in the musicstore when she followed her husband out of the store after their big argument. She stated that she had her hand on the counter, using it as a guideline and that it had invisible marks she could feel with her fingers so that she wouldn't run out of focus of the camera. She gave another example. It is the scene where she jumps off the bus with her two friends. It is clearly visible how they lead her, because she can't see with her stong glasses. </p><p>I remember that when I read this intervies I looked on the scenes she described on the DVD of this film. I was somewhat disappointed to learn that she didn't need those strong glasses. I hope I could find this page again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2004, 22:22</p><p>Yesterday I went to see the recent additions to the cinema memorabilia collection of a local video store (Movie Madness in Portland, Oregon) and there they were -- the famous glasses Laura Elliot wore in Strangers on a Train!  </p><p> </p><p>They were in quite poor shape. The damage was characteristic of reaction with makeup and/or skin oils. Most likely she wore them for many more years after the film.  </p><p> </p><p>The exhibit stated that Movie Madness purchased the glasses directly from Ms. Elliot. </p><p> </p><p>Here's a grab from the film: </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://web.archive.org/web/19991118052649/people.delphi.com/eyescene/images/strange1.jpg" target="_blank">http://web.archive.org/web/19991118052649/people.delphi.com/eyescene/images/strange1.jpg</a></p><p></p><hr>

And if one was missing that day I would only make 50 cents. </p><p>"I would walk the kids around and bring them back. Sometimes, even if they had a fever, I'd take them out. </p><p>"I was trying to earn $250 (GBP 139) to buy coloured contacts, which just came out on the market... My mother has these big, beautiful blue eyes... </p><p>I've always wanted blue eyes. </p><p>"I saved up $250, got the contacts wore them twice, they flopped out of my eyes the second time I wore them and my mum found them like crusty little dimes. </p><p>"Now I wear contact lenses all the time, I'm very nearsighted."</p><p></p><hr>

In the commentary she goes on about what a difficult time she had because she could not keep hard contacts in her eye and was blind as a bat.

<p><b>Karen X</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2004, 15:16</p><p>Not exactly an actress this one. She's an architectural expert on this British tv show which helps raise money to restore historic buildings. The tv show is called "Restoration" and it's on BBC2 at 9:00pm on Sundays and Tuesdays. The lady in question is a rather cute, petite brunette called Marianne Suhr (aged about late 20s to early 30s). She often wears glasses with a + prescription as she looks around these old (often decaying) buildings.  </p><p>I can't find any photos of her so you'll have to watch the tv show to see her and see if she's wearing her glasses.

<p><b>D-W-V</b>&nbsp;10 Jul 2004, 15:46</p><p>Just to make things a little clearer: torrents aren't like normal downloads where you click on a link and save it directly to disk.  Torrent links require special client software which basically joins you to a peer-to-peer network dedicated to that one file.  As your client downloads the file referenced by the torrent link, it also shares out the portions you've downloaded.  So, rather than hammering one download source as is the case with FTP transfers, the bandwidth is shared across many servers. </p><p>As to weather reality show participants aren't acting... well, would YOU really be yourself if the camera was on you?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>oscar</b>&nbsp;10 Jul 2004, 09:08</p><p>baua's right - it does work. Experiment with a few different clients (there are loads of them). If you're using a mac another good one is Azureus.</p><p></p><hr>

This should link to the torrent: </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://66.90.75.92/suprnova//torrents/2112/newlyweds.nick.and.jessica.s03e04.xvid-tbs.torrent" target="_blank">http://66.90.75.92/suprnova//torrents/2112/newlyweds.nick.and.jessica.s03e04.xvid-tbs.torrent</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;09 Jul 2004, 19:21</p><p>For whoever cannot download or find the file: </p><p> </p><p>1) Search for nick and jessica, not for newlyweds. I don't know why, but only in that way you will be able to find the file. </p><p> </p><p>2) The file you will find is only 14 KB and it is called a bittorrent file. You will have to use a bittorrent client in order to download the episode. One good bittorrent client is Azureus, but you will also need Java Runtime Environment for that. Other good clients are BitSpirit, ABC, TorrentStorm and many others. </p><p>When you have installed one of the above, just use the operation "open torrent" or something like that and the episode will start downloading, just if you were using Kazaa or any other file-sharing program. When it ends it will go to "seeding mode". Just choose "stop" and "remove torrent" to end it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>oscar</b>&nbsp;09 Jul 2004, 07:48</p><p>Great, great, great download. Jessica's friend Casey is the one with quite weak glasses. Jessica's glasses are a completely different story: very small hi-index lenses which still look pretty strong and have significant cut in. So yes - I agree with those that were saying that her prescription was at least -6 or so. Such a shame it isn't any more... </p><p> </p><p>By the way, for those with a decent player, the picture quality is very good - so it's worth the long download time if you want to see the programme.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2004, 19:16</p><p>Jes Fan </p><p>The person reading the Lasik brochure is NOT Jessica, it's her friend.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jes Fan</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2004, 19:10</p><p>Look closely at the different shots of Jessica.  The shot where she is reading the Lasik brochure, she has on weaker glasses!!!   Maybe in -3 range.  Other shots, her glasses are DEFINITELY stronger, maybe -7 or -8.  Only 2 options - these are reading glasses, OR, she was posing with lower power lenses so she wouldn't look so blind!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>visitor</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2004, 17:07</p><p>I would guess that Jessica's script was in the range of -7 or -8 from the looks of them and from the eye exam they had her do. She was so cute and vulnerable when she couldn't even see the big E and count fingers until they were about three ft away. I was surprised at how much she was going without her glasses on the way to and just prior to the surgery. It was a lot of fun being a fly on wall during her exam. I was fantasizing a little about being able to watch some of my other favorite GWG celebrities during their exams, and finding out what only they and their optomotrists know about their strong prescriptions.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guido</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2004, 11:18</p><p>Jessica's script looked pretty substantial in the shots of her in the kitchen with her glasses.  I would guess, no less than -5, maybe as high as -7/-8.  The friends glasses were in the low range, and when she tried Jessica's sunglasses on in the car, she remarked that that is probably how she would see after the procedure.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andy</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2004, 10:07</p><p>Oscar, I had the impression that those glasses were in the -2.75 region, not any stronger. I hope to get some better captures later today.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2004, 08:58</p><p>Exactly my thoughts oscar, but the amount she has harped on about it, and given that she couldn't see the big D or whatever letter it was i would've thought the prescription should be twice your estimate!!  </p><p> </p><p>I guess we'll never know now :( </p><p> </p><p>Doog - have you got any times for screenings in England?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>oscar</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2004, 07:44</p><p>Hey Andy - thanks. They are a *lot* better than nothing! Fairly typical "I'm blind without my glasses" prescription from the look of it - in other words not that strong. It's hard to tell but about -4 perhaps? How did it look to you?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sandy</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2004, 21:20</p><p>Elisabeth wore her glasses during her apperance on the Survivor reality show during the outback in Australia.  I guess that contact lenses were out of the question because of the dirty condition.  I think that I have seen her wear her glasses on the View only a couple of times, for awhile I thought that she had gotten lasik, but I guess that she was wearing contacts instead.  It's too bad that she doesn't wear her specs more often, but I remember that she wore them quite a bit during the night time activities during Survivor.  My guess was that her vision was not as sharp during darkness.  Take care.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;31 May 2004, 08:39</p><p>Yes Pete, I've seen that. She started walking and had to put on her glasses , a reflex action on her part to see just where she was going. Looked to me like she is about -4.00. Brittany Murphy is such a little doll, there is just something about a bleach blond that does it for me and her to be a GwG is icing on the cake. I just wondered if anyone has taken still photos from that DVD segment?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>pete</b>&nbsp;30 May 2004, 15:14</p><p>Tod, </p><p> </p><p>If you have DVD player rent "Don't Say a Word" in which Murphy co-stars with Michael Douglas.  Though she dosen't wear her glasses in the movie she does wear them in a special feature - The Making of a Scene - or something like that . . . a very detectable minus prescription I might add.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>phoenix</b>&nbsp;17 May 2004, 06:36</p><p>I didn't know where to post this, but this seems to be the right place. </p><p>A few days ago I was watching this year's Eurovision Song Contest and I remembered about a Latvian singer that had won the contest about 2 years ago (maybe it was 2002). Her name is Marija Naumova (also known as Marie N). Some days after she had won the contest, I had seen her in a interview wearing some pretty minus glasses (I think they were purple plastic glasses). </p><p>So yesterday I started a little search on the Internet about her. I didn't find much about her, but I did find two yahoo groups. </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/marija_naumova/" target="_blank">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/marija_naumova/</a> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/marie_n/" target="_blank">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/marie_n/</a> </p><p> </p><p>I couldn't find any photos of her in glasses, but in the first group there is a message from someone who is mentioning that she used to wear pretty thick glasses and that she was pretty ugly. But as time passed by, she started becoming prettier and prettier until she stopped wearing glasses. Sigh! Finally he says, that during the Eurovision Song Contest that she won, she lost her contact lenses and almost went on stage bare-eyed!!! It's message number 125. </p><p> </p><p>Does anyone has any photos of her wearing glasses, or knows anything about her?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2004, 07:14</p><p>bb2: What makes you think that actresses do not wear their own glasses in movies?  Demi Moore has worn specs with her real Rx in them in "The Seventh Sign", "A Few Good Men", "Nothing But Trouble" and a couple others.  Daryl Hannah wore glasses with her prescription in them in "Roxanne" and "The Gingerbread Man".  Margot Kidder wore her real glasses in "Superman II" and "Amityville Horror".  I could go on and on, but I won't.  The point is, many actresses will wear their real glasses in movies rather than props.  Prop glasses should be outlawed (like Jodie Foster's in "Contact" or Alicia Silverstone's in "True Crime). </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;13 Apr 2004, 03:36</p><p>Myopeinhere - Katy Manning has been discussed quite a few times before on this forum - and yes, she was simply lovely as Jo Grant in Doctor Who. I can only recall one sighting of her in glasses - on an antiques programme from the early 1970s. They were indeed extremely strong (myodiscs - which they had to be in the huge frames that were fashionable at the time) but even so she kept taking them on and off. The only glasses pics on the web show her either in sunglasses or reading glasses which she obviously uses over contacts now. She was the absolute fantasy girl of my teenage years, and the discovery that she was a gwg with an extremely strong prescription just made her even lovelier. Round about 1970 (?) there was an interview with her in the Radio Times in which she spoke about her eyesight and how (truly) bad it was - wonder if anyone has found that. But still no glasses pic. Ah, the memories...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dan</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2004, 11:00</p><p>You're right Angie. To read a teleprompter you need good eyes. If I take off my -1.00 glasses I can't read it without squinting noticeably.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>angie</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2004, 09:28</p><p>MVIII: i've never seen a cue card with letters as large as the top E of an eye chart, and the letters on telepompters (which is what they use at the oscars) are often smaller.  additionally, presenters stand much farther away from the teleprompter than we do from the eye chart during an exam...so it's definitely plausible that she would need her glasses to read properly.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2004, 07:43</p><p>MVIII: I guess I just don't share your cynicism of her statements.

<p><b>MVIII</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2004, 06:44</p><p>Electra </p><p> </p><p>Have you ever seen a "cue card?"  The letters are at least the size of the largest letter on the top of an eye test chart.  Most people who need visual help in the lower ranges could easily read them with out glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Ms. Tyler put her glasses back on two, three, or possibly four times when she presented those songs.  If she needed them, I doubt they would have come off her face even once.   </p><p> </p><p>Her hair style was a dramatic throwback to the 50's, and not all that easy to swallow.  And, her cateye frames matched.  Frankly, I don't think she had the courage to tell the truth; that the glasses were simply a tool to further accentuate her look, and at the same time take our focus away from her hair.  A balancing act of sorts.  Of course the glasses could well have come before the hair if she's one of us. </p><p> </p><p>The women in the room that night thought she was the leading candidate for the Worst Dressed Award.  I didn't share that opinion.   </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2004, 05:26</p><p>MVII well, if Liv herself said she needed them, that's good enough isn't it? And haven't you noticed that these days it often isn't possible to detect any strength in a lower strength lens unless you are actually WITH the person? If you have enough close-up photos eventually you might find one at the "right" angle to give it away, but this is not a study for the faint of heart.

I didn't detect even a hint of noticable minification, or magnification as she was putting them on.  Perhaps she's one of us.   </p><p> </p><p>In any case, I'll bet she could have given Maggie Gyllenhaal some competition when they were doing auditions for part of Lee Holloway in "Secretary."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2004, 13:08</p><p>Liv was interviewed in "People" so I thought I'd share it with you (typed exactly as printed): </p><p> </p><p>Was Liv Tyler going for a sexy secretary look with those vintage-inspired glasses, or is she just a closet geek? The actress who fiddled with a pair of Selima Optique frames while introducing some of the Best Song nominees, says her specs were strictly utilitarian and not a retro fashion statement. "The last time I presented at the Oscars I couldn't see the monitor," says Tyler. "But when I went to the SAG awards the other day, I couldn't see a thing! I tried to buy contacts but one of them didn't fit. I didn't have time to get [new glasses], so I had to weat these." </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2004, 13:40</p><p>I believe that Renee Zellweger is very myopic and was wearing contacts.  My guess is that she wears hard (Gas Permeable) lenses which cause her to squint like that.  If she is as myopic as I think she is, she would not have been able to read the notes that she had in her hand without putting the paper about 2 or 3 inches from her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>I could be wrong and would like to hear from someone who has better information.</p><p></p><hr>

I now learn that she played Mel Gibson's bride in Braveheart and apparently wore glasses in two films, Born Romantic (2001) and The Weight of Water (2002).  The link gives a few photos <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hc&amp;id=1800018833&amp;cf=mm&amp;intl=us" target="_blank">http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hc&amp;id;=1800018833&amp;cf;=mm&amp;intl;=us</a> </p><p>Has anyone seen these films or noted her wearing glasses off-stage?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2004, 16:02</p><p>-6 or -7 is a pretty reasonable estimate, I think. I have -5, and they look stronger than mine.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>oscar</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2004, 06:04</p><p>I'd say about minus 5 judging from the cut-in. Looks very similar to the specs of a girl I know whose script is that (actually 5.25 but who's counting).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ReFractor</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2004, 16:56</p><p>Just found out that Amber Benson, who played Tara on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, wore glasses as a kid.  This quote was taken from a speech she gave in 2002: </p><p>"...just like when I was a kid, I was taken outside of my head. It's tough. I was a little tiny thing with big plastic glasses that apparently I picked out for myself; my mom says I did. I got called "four eyes"; I got made fun of. I would escape. I'd go see a movie. I'd read a book. It saved me. It kept me from losing my mind." </p><p></p><hr>

Melissa Joan Hart has generously donated her glasses and a signed photo with certificate of authenticity for auction to benefit the Discovery Fund's medical research and patient education programs for Macular Degeneration, Keratoconus, Diabetic Retinopathy and Ocular Herpes." </p><p> </p><p>Hmmmm </p><p>I've never seen MJH in glasses.

<p><b>Anon</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2004, 15:05</p><p>Regarding Christy Romano. I think she might be short/near-sighted.  In the first photo I think there is a very slight "cut-in" of her face through the left lens (the one on the right as you look at the pic). In the second photo her right eye looks slightly smaller than the left as if it has a stronger prescription. </p><p></p><hr>

He ended up picking a Plus Sized GWG.  She was gorgeous, I think that even OO men who prefer thinner girls would find her pretty, minus lenses and a gorgeous face.

Whatever prescription her glasses are, they appear to be too mild to make any guess as to "orientation" (+/-) or strength, but given that she's in her mid-40's and has never been known to wear them before, the most logical deduction would be a mild plus, perhaps with a progressive add.

<p><b>Guido</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2004, 17:28</p><p>Looked up "Interiors" on the Internet Movie Database and it credits Mary Beth Hurt as one of the cast.  She frequently appears wearing glasses and, in fact, had a lot of glasses scenes in "The World Acording to Garp".</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jon</b>&nbsp;21 Jan 2004, 00:36</p><p>Hey all... Just had the misfortune to see a terrible movie... "Alex and Emma." The only potentially positive thing was that Kate Hudson, who plays an attractive young stenographer (Emma) has a pair of glasses hanging around her neck literally throughout the entire movie. But (and here's the thing)... She NEVER puts them on - not even once. As it became apparent how bad the movie was, I was looking forward to seeing her do the stenography with the glasses on.  As you know, in these Hollywood films, a glasses-wearing character puts them on at least once near the beginning of the film and then (as if by magic) doesn't need them anymore. But this time, they were uselessly just hanging around her neck... and she was doing the stenography for about 90% of the movie (presumably what she needed them for). Sheesh!!! As fellow glasses-lovers, don't you hate when films do that?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Batman</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2004, 08:23</p><p>To me, this forum should be about any female public figure in the world of entertainment.  That would take in actresses, reporters, celebrities, etc.  The common link is that all are female, and all are in the public sphere. </p><p> </p><p>This means that these women have voluntarily given up a portion of their right of privacy.  Because of this, I feel justified in viewing and sharing pictures of these women. </p><p> </p><p>And while the web may also be considered a media outlet, sometimes girls get their pictures posted by spiteful ex-boyfriends or by some other involuntary means, and often they don't know their pictures are even out there to see.   </p><p> </p><p>This is why I feel that this forum should only contain links to females in the public sphere, and not to those on the web.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2003, 15:26</p><p>Ree - I think I've seen most of her movies - and a good place to start for her in glasses is the "making of" dvd included in the French release of "8 femmes" - don't know if the UK or US versions have it as it is on an extra disc. There are quite a few (quite short) shots of Virginie in her glasses on that. They are definitely quite strong - didn't she say in an interview somewhere that they were about minus 5 and that she cannot wear contacts? As for her other films, well, she looks completely stunning in The Beach - but no specs (alas...) and there she's been in a lot of French movies. Let me know if you want details - I've got dvds of several and they can easily be ordered from France. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ree</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2003, 10:11</p><p>    Stefan you are absolutely right.  This french actress is really georgeous.  Yes she definitely has a squint and it is very quite marked which makes it very obvious.  And her Rx looks to be quite a bit.  And this all adds up and makes her all the intriguing. </p><p>  I am definitely going to try to watch all her movies,  and maybe the cross eyes can be seen there.  Anymore pictures of hers are very much welcome.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stefan</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2003, 14:18</p><p>Very nice pics indeed, those last three! In the middle one though - don't her eyes seem to cross ever so slightly? She seems to be looking at one with her right eye, whilst the left one seems to drift inwards just a wee bit. If anything, I think it adds to her mystique.

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2003, 23:19</p><p>Angie - My assumption that Stephanie March's glasses are legitimate is based solely on observation. Close-ups seem to show a small amount of "cut-in" and her lenses,when seen from the side offer some distortion. The type of correction and it's strength are best left to those on this site with far greater expertise than I have.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lara Lover </b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2003, 02:00</p><p>Hi, I saw some pics of Angelina in glasses and the link was from someone on this wonderful site. It was sometime ago but somebody might remember it. At the time the pics certainly had cut-ins and whoever posted it mentioned they were around -5.  </p><p>I also read an interview which the writer sad Angelina was dressed down in Jeans/T-shirts and glasses but still looked stunningly beautiful. If I find anything on it I will let you know.</p><p></p><hr>

I was wondering if anyone knows where to find any other pics of her in glasses (if any exist that is). </p><p>I'm sure Angelina is short sighted as one photo shows slight "cut in" through both lenses. She is a very sexy woman anyway - her wearing glasses is like a dream come true!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MacKenna</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2003, 10:29</p><p>I have been working my butt of trying to download the Charmed episode called How To Make A Quilt Out Of Americans. It is the episode where Pheobe (Alyssa Milano) discovers she needs to wear reading glasses but tries to hide it from her sisters. Well I finally downloaded it and to my dissapointment... it was in German so now I am trying to download an English version but I did get to watch it even though I had NO idea what they were saying. Also Coyote Piper is the episode where they show a picture of Piper with glasses... she was in high school. I am thinking that is the only episode where they show that. Anyways, I am a huge Charmed fan even though a lot of my friends think it is stupid, I LOVE IT!</p><p></p><hr>

She was wearing what appeared to be real minus specs (rectangular plastic frames) and looked very hot in them. I found out she's a regular cast member, her name is Stephanie March.

<p><b>david</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2003, 14:44</p><p>i just typed in 'kate beckinsale glasses' on google.com and one of the sites it came up with said that she had damaged her eyesight through anorexia and now needs glasses. i am not sure how true this is but it was a kate beckinsale website so it should be quite reliable</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2003, 15:52</p><p>I think I read somewhere once that there is a condition called 'malignant myopia' in which, as well as progressive high myopia there are other symptoms including weight loss and general ill health. This was probably quite an old source and may be quite out of date, but it could it be confused with our rather more modern condition of anorexia (by the press anyway, who rarely get anything right)? </p><p>Or it may of course be completely irrelevant.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2003, 12:45</p><p>I don't know how the anorexia/eye-trouble link works either, but I have heard it in some other article I read or something, besides the Beckinsale story. </p><p> </p><p>I also knew someone in college who was very malnourished because of anorexia and I never knew she wore contacts at the time, but I saw her recently (5 years hence) and she was wearing very strong glasses, maybe -15 (and had gotten much healthier weight-wise).  I have no idea if the anorexia impacted her eyesight.  I would expect that if there were a connection between anorexia and eyesight, there would be a single typical problem that afflicts people - not nearsightedness in one case and whatever Kate's problem is (presbyopia?) in another case.  A link with myopia doesn't seem all that likely to me, since myopia is arguably not indicative of poor *health* in the eye.  But that definitely doesn't prove it's impossible.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LOONYETTES</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2003, 13:10</p><p>Kevin, get the movie DOGMA if you want to see Salma Hayek doing a pole dance in a bikini with a big pair of glasses on. The director, another Kevin - Kevin Smith always puts women in his films in glasses - see JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK, for example, where Brittany Murphy wears glasses throughout. There's a great early scene where she 'decides' to wear glasses after being unable to make out a sign in a shop.

In the highlights clips shown tonight she was wearing glasses for a little while and was still wearing them when she went to the Diary Room - nice close up(ish) clip as she sat on the chair.

She's never to be seen without her glasses. For those of you in the UK who have the time, catch her most mornings at 10.00 on Channel Five.  </p><p> </p><p>Liz Hurley DOES wear her aviator specs a lot. There's a great picture on the net (it might have been on your site, GWGs) with her squinting. Alas, it is only from the Austin Powers movie.  </p><p> </p><p>What a pity Samira from Channel 4 news has not worn her big framed glasses again.

There was a woman who had to pretend to be a relationship therapist and she wore huge fake glasses. My first reaction was that they were far too big to be taken seriously - but after a minute - I quite got used to them and thought they looked great on her!</p><p></p><hr>

Judy was ill (for at least a year) and Richard's co-presenter was Jenny someone or another - she was in 'No Limits' in the 1980s. Anyway, Jenny don't-know-her-surname wore big black framed glasses for the whole show. As did Melanie Sykes. It was fantastic.  </p><p>More recently, the woman in the booth on the morning show, The Wright Stuff at 11.00 AM on Channel 5, wore great plus lenses recently, when the show celebrated this years spectacle wearers of the year awards. Another member of the team moaned about having to wear glasses - 'I hate them' she moaned, but she looked exquisite.  </p><p>Lastly, I remember Liz Hurley wearing large framed brown plastic glasses at a dinner a couple of years back trying to win the same awards. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Furtive</b>&nbsp;19 Apr 2003, 18:28</p><p>I read an article about Tina Fey that said that she usually wears contacts and that the glasses are actually in her prescription and that she needs them in order to read the cue cards , but they are a "prop" in the sense that they are property of Saturday Night Live.  It said that one week she didn't wear the glasses while doing the "Weekend Update" - because she had her contacts in because she was doing another, glasses-less, scene right afterward - and they got a lot of emails from disappointed fans saying "bring back the glasses."  So now they always have her wear them for the Weekend Update.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SC</b>&nbsp;11 Apr 2003, 02:50</p><p>Very annoyed with myself not to be able to report more.......this morning on Biography Channel there was an hour long interview with Debra Winger on "Inside the actors Studio". As we know she appeared with very strong glasses in the film A Dangerous Woman and I know there were discussions if the glasses were her own RX. Unfortunately the show had started by the time I flicked to the channel and as it was 8 o'clock I was also getting ready for work so had to keep popping in and out. The bit I caught that was interesting was when she spoke about an accident where she fell off the back of a truck and suffered a head injury. She said that the accident made her vision worse, then laughed with tongue in cheek saying well worse than the little I had. This meant I thought that prior to this she must have spoken or had a pic shown of her in glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>Later when a Dangerous Woman was mentioned the interviewer said many actresses wouldn't have taken on this role and she said oh, cos of the glasses you mean. I wish I had caught all the interview.  </p><p> </p><p>It was on Sky TV - I am sure it will be repeated again-perhaps today even so will look out for it. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Spec Watcher</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2003, 14:22</p><p>Yes, the 4 Days of our Lives GWG's are my favorites too.  Like I said before, they rarely if ever wear glasses in public.  So there are not that many on the web.  Chloe wore glasses all the time in her first 2 years and never wears them now.  The actress that plays Chloe (Nadia Bjorlin) says that her vision is perfect in an interview.  Lately, Sami wears glasses on the most frequent basis now.  The actress that plays Sami wears glasses in real life.   I have seen Belle wear glasses twice.  I believe that they are real with a medium strength plus lens.

<p><b>Eddy</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2003, 18:25</p><p>Just went to see "8 Femmes". Good fun but don't let anyone fool you that it's anything but a farce with a few musical numbers thrown in. Agatha Christie meets Baz Luhrman meets Harold Pinter meets "Noises Off". On the gwg front, Isabel Huppert plays a middle aged spinster with great glasses vintage 1956 (Ah, memories) even though they're plano and she takes them off when she magically turns into a sex-strumpf. And if you look closely at the delectable Virginie Le Doyen's close-ups, you can see the edge of her contacts. All in all an enjoyable piece of fluff if just a tad too long for the Eddyorial taste.</p><p></p><hr>

What was pretty neat is that at the end of the movie she had switched to high index glasses, which looked to be as strong as the one she was wearing before.

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2003, 07:00</p><p>Do not forget "A Dangerous Woman", wherein Deborah Winger portrays a mildly mentall challenged young lady with rather high myopia.  One of the scenes in the flic is shot through her glasses while the specs are sitting on a table.  Very interesting effect.  She wears glasses throughout the movie.  There was some discussion on this board a while back as to the veracity of the prescription for the actress.  I never heard/saw the issue resolved.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Vidge</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2003, 05:35</p><p>There was this made for TV movie back in the early eighties, the title of which escapes me. Its about this nerdy girl and a male friend who decide to pose as exchange students at their own high school to become popular, which they do. The girl gets herself contact lenses and a new hair style ect. and poses as a French exchange student. The boy, which the film focuses less on, poses as an Italian exchange student.  </p><p>At one point in the movie the girl loses one of her contact lenses and her cover is almost blown. Also in scenes where she is at home batteling it out with her parents and younger sister she has on her glasses.  </p><p>I just wish I could remember the name of this movie....anyone!</p><p></p><hr>

With that restriction, I nominate Carrie 2, which featured one of the villianesses as a full-time glasses-wearer.  What I liked about that movie is that glasses were NOT part of the plot...there was no 'glasses message' to be sent, just a hot, sexy bad girl who happened to wear glasses.  Even cooler is that she didn't play the stereotypical nerd role but was one of the popular babes who picked on the new Carrie.</p><p></p><hr>

Jennifer Love Hewitt wears her glasses for quite a bit of the flick and I even thought I detected a bit of rx in them at one stage. Also an actress called from memory Debbie Mazar or something like that wears a pair of very smart titaniums for a while. To top it off there's a nice looking Chinese gwg briefly. Go and see it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brock</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2003, 00:35</p><p>There is a Spanish language telenovela called "El Desprecio". I glimpsed a snippet several years ago when I happened to be in the southwestern U. S. I speak no Spanish, so I was at a loss to pursue the arresting image of a young woman passenger in a car, struggling repeatedly to adjust a pair of very thick-lensed glasses and at the same time seemingly struggling to overcome an attack of stuttering. (The latter was very hard to discern for certain. The scene was very short, and my lack of Spanish did not help.) </p><p>However, I never forgot the name of the telenovela. Tonight, after reading Wanderer's post, I was reminded of it and found the following two URL's. One is a short plot summary (in English, Spanish, and Russian). The other is a collage of images of MariaCarmen Regueiro in her role as Clara Ines. I tried to save the pictures as JPEG files, but my computer says there is an error and won't let me do this - though I have often done so in the past. </p><p>Despite my illiteracy in Spanish, I wish I could find a video of this entire film so as to look for more images of a bespectacled Clara Ines. </p><p>Sorry for the length of this post. </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://escena.ya.com/mcreg/regueiro/eldesprecio.htm??" target="_blank">http://escena.ya.com/mcreg/regueiro/eldesprecio.htm??</a> </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.vencor.narod.ru/films/eldespr.htm" target="_blank">http://www.vencor.narod.ru/films/eldespr.htm</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kix</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2002, 14:31</p><p>In the Sunday newspaper, in Parade Magazine--don't know how many of you get that with your paper or otherwise--there was an article in the back about actress Jessica Capshaw (daughter of Kate Capshaw and stepdaughter of Steven Speilberg and she's on The Practice). Apparently she recently scratched her cornea with a mascara wand and while being seen by the doctor she learned she also needed glasses! She said she plans to go with specs rather than contacts...wonder what her character on television will do... She's a cute blonde who will probably look fantastic with glasses assuming any of us ever get to see a picture of her wearing them!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2002, 08:44</p><p>Personally I can watch Virginie Ledoyen all day...and for some of the Christmas break that's just what I have been doing. I can't think of a more beautiful actress with or without glasses. Other admirers of the exceptionally lovely actress, who is also exceptionally talented, might be interested to know about the DVD releases of some of her films. In the versions available in France (or from France on the web) the "Making of" bonus sections of "8 femmes" and "Jeanne et le garçon formidable" both feature brief moments of Virginie in her glasses (minus 5 or so). There's a particularly nice shot (very brief, but still delectable) of her in small round specs studying the script in "Jeanne..." during the shooting of the scene in Père Lachaise cemetery. And the rehearsals for "8 femmes" often show her wearing larger, squarish plastic frames.  </p><p> </p><p>Knowing that she is significantly myopic also explains her tendency to squint slightly at the camera during interviews (of which there are great examples on both these DVDs, neither with her specs, alas). Ah!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>spexfan</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2002, 18:01</p><p>I was reading an article today about the lovely Virginie Ledoyen, which reminded me that there were some pics of her wearing some fairly serious minus glasses on a chat show (?) which were linked here a while ago. Does anyone recall the link? I think you were involved somehow, Filthy. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, in searching for them (so far without luck) I found a few references to her "holding a pair of glasses" at a premiere or having "reading glasses" on set....which made me wonder whether she's had Lasik and been overcorrected. The minus prescription she was wearing in those pics seemed strong enough for mandatory fulltime wear....can't see how she could wear them part-time and not trip over the red carpet.

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2002, 06:46</p><p>NBC: thank heavens!  I hadn't seen the pilot, and was worried I was going to have to change my Tuesday night viewing habits!  There have been lots of promos of her, and she's rarely w/o glasses now, I think they're both part of her persona and fill a need.  Given the plus and the cyl, they may help her see the teleprompter a little bit but more important, they relieve her of having to strain both her eyes and her mind.  Would that other low correct stars do the same!</p><p></p><hr>

A striking GWG walks into the shot, in focus, and passes between Bond and Q. She's got an RX of about -5 with nice metal rimmed frames (the film was released in about 1997) I cant believe that this was   accidental, a member of the public stepping into the shot. If anyone knows of shareware screen capture software I can use to extract it from my DVD, I'll pass on the pic. </p><p> </p><p>The one Bond girl who should have been a GWG is Natalia Symonova (Goldeneye,  Polish actress, can't remember her name) all that staring at computer screens.

<p><b>Andy</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2002, 06:31</p><p>I think it's the right place to post this observation. In 20 James Bond films there was never a bond girl wearing glasses. There are only two women that wore glasses for a very short time. There was this old woman spy in in From Russia With Love which put on strong minus specs for reading and the other glasses appearence was in this Bond movie starring Goerge Lazenby (don't know if I spelled him correct) where he is amongst all those young girls in this clinik in the Swiss alps.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2002, 06:58</p><p>Thanks for that information - really helpful. This past week I've seen quite a lot of a handsome young Canadian whom I suspected of wearing contacts. Certainly the big eyes, the gleam and the blinking would suggest I was right...and he was showing a lot of interest when another guy broke his readers, took them to an optician and was lent a spare pair while they were repaired. A contact-wearing OO perhaps?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>CONTACT LENS SPOTTERS GUIDE</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2002, 04:42</p><p>To be able to spot contact lens wearers, you must first know something about CL's. Soft lenses are larger in diameter than the iris. You need to look for the outer rim of this lens on the patent's (that's what corrective lens wearers are) scallia or white of the eye. Lens wearers blink more often. Some nearsighted wearers have larger than normal eyes. You may also notice a gleem in their eyes. New wearers may turn their head more to see things to the side as if they were still wearing glasses. They more than likely squint when out in bright sunlight or may need sunglasses. But the best indicator is in the right lighting and angle of view. Overhead floresent lighting is best. And you can always ask the person ,too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lens guy</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2002, 04:07</p><p>I always found that it's not too hard to spot contact lenses. There's just a certain look they have in their eyes for starters. RGP wearers usually have a funny blink. I find it easier to spot RGPs than soft lenses, especially when looking from the side. I use a mouse that allows me to zoom in on photos. After looking at photos on Rex Features, Corbis, and various online galleries, I've spotted a lot of folks that I'm pretty sure are contact lens wearers. Melanie Griffith, Reba Mcentire, Suzanne Shaw, Amy Irving, Tara Reid, Connie Selleca, Ellen Barkin, Geri Halliwell, Sheryl Crow, and Samantha Fox. I'm pretty sure that they wear RGP lenses. Anyway, just my $.02 worth.</p><p></p><hr>

Also there is a certain look to peoples eyes when wearing CL's and her eyes have that look. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2002, 13:23</p><p>myopicmax: Some info was posted here a while ago, but apparently because her character's name was Justice, Kevin Smith (the writer and director) made some comment along the lines of "Justice is blind; she must need glasses".

<p><b>myopicmax</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2002, 22:00</p><p>Anyone seenJay&amp; Silent bob  strikes back? Shannon Elizabeth wears glasses right the way through the movie. Which is certainly unusual, though its not your usual Hollywood movie a bit of a take on a variety of different movies.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anon</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2002, 14:40</p><p>A while ago I saw a photo that looked like the British actress Honeysuckle Weeks (wearing glasses). Does she wear glasses?

<p><b>jamie4</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2002, 14:43</p><p>Was th other girl on girls lub Katleen Roberson wearing real rx glasses or were they fake?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2002, 11:59</p><p>KYGL -- that's hilarious!  "Today everyone's having surgery."  "But you don't need surgery."  "I know, I had fake surgery."   How far people will go to fit in!  Hopefully glasses are more 'today' and 'tomorrow' than 'yesterday'. </p><p> </p><p>I saw a lot of Girls Club last night.  It is SO dramatic -- If my job involved that much turmoil and that many rude colleagues, I'd quit within 20 minutes.  But it makes for a good show, especially with the very good glasses scenes.  Now if only they were strong.  :)   Someday, maybe.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KYGL</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2002, 11:40</p><p>GlassesOnTV, I agree about Chyler Leigh on Girls Club.  I just sat and drooled the whole show!!! </p><p> </p><p>And Alan, what made Becker so great was that Shawnee Smith's character showed up one day wearing glasses, and her boss said something like "I didn't know you needed glasses," to which she replied "Oh, I don't.  I'm just wearing them because it's the thing to do."  And then she showed how she could look smart, busy, and even sexy wearing them.  Then in the next scene, she wasn't wearing them.  Her boss asked what happened to the glasses.  She said she glasses are so yesterday, and everybody's having laser surgery.  Of course her boss reminded her that she didn't need surgery, and she said "I know, I had fake surgery!"  or something like that. </p><p> </p><p>I can't remember the exact dialogue between Shawnee and the office manager, but it was the funniest part of the show! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GlassesOnTV</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2002, 11:04</p><p>Did anyone catch "girls club" last night on Fox?  Once again, Chyler Leigh in slightly cat eye back plastic frames with real Rx lenses for about 1/2 of the show.  Just exquisite.  Once of the best GWGs ever!!! Lot of close ups too.  As an added plus one of the other actresses on the show was in glasses in several scenes also. </p><p> </p><p>"Life With Bonnie" on Tues evening continues to have Bonnie Hunt in Black Plastic frames for probably 90% of the show.  You can't beat black plasitc frames on a cute blonde. </p><p> </p><p>Today Show - 10/28/02  Did anyone see the makeup and hair for glasses wearers segment with Katie Couric?  Kind of the usual makeover segment, but with glasses as the focal point.  There was an extremley pretty black girl on the show, with small metal frames that was just stunning. </p><p> </p><p>I am really impressed with the amount of time glasses wearers are being presented on TV.  (Finally!)  Many, many commercials have bespectacled actresses in them too. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2002, 08:20</p><p>KYGL - What did the show say about why some people wear glasses and other people don't?  I doubt I'll have a chance to see it, so I'm curious if you could describe some of the 'messages' it had.  (I realize, of course, that it isn't too serious.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KYGL</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2002, 06:09</p><p>I caught the drop-dead gorgeous Shawnee Smith wearing glasses on the CBS sitcom Becker last night.  It was a hilarious spoof about why some people wear glasses and why some people don't.  If you get a chance to catch a rerun of this episode, have a tape ready.  It's a keeper for me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2002, 09:31</p><p>Marsilli, </p><p> </p><p>Film producers/directors do seem to be incredibly silly in this regard.  I mean, most adult actresses are college graduates (went to film school) and therefore most of them are probably nearsighted.  So how many times has it happened that an actress is cast to wear glasses (to "look nerdy," or whatever)...and so she goes in wearing her -4 contacts and the costume people giver her some plano glasses to wear over the top.  Jeesh.  How is it that a $30 million movie budget can't afford a decent presentation of wearing glasses. </p><p> </p><p>On the other hand, let this be a lesson to people who are nervous about whether their glasses will seem 'real' to other people.  It seems that most people just don't think about it at all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Marsilli</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2002, 07:17</p><p>:) It´s a shame her glasses are only fake without prescription. ;( </p><p>How silly must be some film producers, i´m always wondering about. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2002, 09:09</p><p>GGM - I think you're right.  Glasses are slowly getting "there" in the fashion world.  The new plastic designs are definitely different -- they're bold, but they also "work" in the way other very popular fashions do, I think.  In my opinion (contrary to a lot of long-time glasses lovers), glasses styles have improved steadily for the past 15 years or so and are REALLY excellent now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glasses Going Mainstream?</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2002, 08:51</p><p>Do you think glasses (finally!!) are going mainstream and becoming desirable, even on TV?  Seems to be some promising signs lately. </p><p> </p><p>Cases in point: </p><p> </p><p>"GIRL'S CLUB"  ABC  SUN EVE'S </p><p> </p><p>I too watched "Girl's Club" on the Fox network.  The name of the bespectacled actress on the show is Chyler Lee.  A quick check on the internet showed several pics with her glasses on. </p><p> </p><p>She wore very attractive black plastic frames, slightly cateye in shape, with Rx lenses, at least 1/2 of the show and was exquisite to say the least. </p><p> </p><p>The previews for next week's show not only showed Chyler wearing glasses, but one of the other young ladies on the show was bespectacled as she sat at a computer. </p><p> </p><p>During this show there was a commercial for Lowe's home store and one of the models in it was wearing glasses.  An extra plus. </p><p> </p><p>"LIFE WITH BONNIE"  ABC  TUES EVE'S </p><p> </p><p>The ultimate Glasses show!  Bonnie Hunt, who is a really cute blonde, wears black plastic glasses about 90% of the time in the show.  It is an entertaining show also and well worth watching. </p><p> </p><p>I think I am seeing a trend here. </p><p> </p><p>A key factor here seems to be the black plastic frames, which in my humble opinion, are the ultimate in female eyewear.  Wire frames have become so boring after so many yrs.  Perhaps the newness of the dark plastic frames has kindled some interest in eyewear.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2002, 07:00</p><p>From personal experience, I can tell you that law school is a fertile ground for myopia. Back in my day we had our noses stuck in books almost 24/7 and a lot of my classmates came in without glasses and left with a minus correction. Up until a year ago I employed law clerks, two of them were already myopes and the third showed up one day wearing -.75 sph -.50 cyl OU and I know that's her exact scrip because she got them at the chain store where I worked and I checked on the computer (it wasn't at our exact store, it was our sister store across town so I didn't know until after the fact). Anyway, I asked her the usual questions and learned that in one of the larger classes she couldn't see the overhead projector images, her classmate sitting next to her uttered those immortal words "here, try my glasses" and when she recovered from the shock called for an eye appointment.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to watch that show because Mrs. OGL would certainly think something was awry if I watched anything but football on a Monday night!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Caterina</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2002, 06:48</p><p>Yes, that's the one who wore them. </p><p> </p><p>I could definitely see how I would be actually eager to wear my glasses to work if I were in a situation where a more serious, older, corporate image would be desirable.  Such as a law firm.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2002, 06:44</p><p>Thanks, Caterina.  I saw a little bit of that show last night.  The one who "might be a closet homophobe" wore glasses some of the time, right? </p><p> </p><p>I wonder how common it is for young women in law to "choose" to wear glasses for professional reasons.  It certainly strikes me as a good idea, since glasses add to a 'professional' image and that's often useful in law, I think.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Caterina</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2002, 06:38</p><p>For those who live in the US and would be interested:  There's a show on the Fox network Monday nights called Girls' Club.  I find that even though they don't DO anything for me, I now notice glasses a lot more.  Anyway, it's about these young female lawyers, and one of them seems to wear real glasses a lot.  She has cut-ins.  I've really appreciated the responses to my posts about my insecurities and just thought I would attempt to "give back."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2002, 07:30</p><p>In the October 7th issue of Us Weekly magazine, there's an in-depth story on Reese Witherspoon and on page 51 a picture of her captioned "Witherspoon (right, as a bespectacled seventh grader with a classmate)has said she sucked her thumb until age 11." It's impossible to tell for sure because her hair is over the one lens that would be a telltale, but I'm guessing she's a low myope/astigmat and if so unless she's had Lousik she's still is such only more so and there may be hope. If my math is right she was about 12 when the photo was taken so the frames are of the early eighties vintage and definitely of a piece of that era. They are large, probably around a 52 and perfectly round dark tortoise with a flaring silver bridge.  As I expect to be sending a package from my collection to one of our webmaster/poster friends will include that pic and see if it can be used.  Unfortunately, it's small.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2002, 16:44</p><p>Just saw the new Scooby Doo Movie and I think that Velma should have been played by someone who truly needed strong minus glasses. It just wasn't the same when she lost them because you knew they were fake.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plastics Lover</b>&nbsp;09 Oct 2002, 19:48</p><p>"Life With Bonnie"  I too caught this entertaining new series last night.  Bonnie Hunt is a very talented actress and comedienne indeed.   </p><p> </p><p>She wore Black Plastic frames, with real Rx lenses, for probably 1/2 of the show.

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;09 Oct 2002, 09:39</p><p>PFA: thanx for confirming what I presumed, although I've never seen either of the daughters with them on. The photo brought back a warm fuzzy,from one of my very first encounters with a celeb wearing glasses (at least in print) courtesy of my mother's Good Housekeeping magazine when I was about 14 or so.  They did a big story on her, and there was a small photo where you could see she was wearing them but just barely. A friend was quoted as saying Grace was "extremely nearsighted, couldn't see a thing without them, but wouldn't wear them".  The friend also said, and these words in the vernacular of the day have stuck in my mind all these years, "she has the most wonderful technique for freezing a wolf, she would just reach into her purse and take out these big, thick, horn rim glasses and put them on".  In today's language that would be getting rid of a creep who was hitting on her. </p><p>Last night on the ABC network was watching "Life With Bonnie", a comedy about a TV talk show hostess, and at the first the lead was wearing glasses which I thought maybe were a prop. But she wore them throughout the whole show even at home, at a party, etc. and there were many good closeups.  They were a low plus, maybe +1.50 or so, and probably with a little cyl in a rectangular black plastic frame with a high bridge and high brow line, antireflective lenses of course. And, Peter, she's BLONDE!  It was a tremendous effect, both for us 00's but really made her character effective. The only thing that ruined it was at the end, she was romantically slow dancing with her hubby and he reached up, took them off her, and put them in his coat pocket.  How little they know....... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2002, 06:19</p><p>I saw The Tuxedo Friday night.  There was one instant where I thought the glasses might be prescription, but I think they were actually planos...once again, movies can spend millions of dollars on insanely complicated effects, but they can't make glasses look real. </p><p> </p><p>I am not completely sure why she "needs" the glasses in the movie.  Hewitt never puts the glasses on or takes them off within a scene, I don't think, so it could be that she's switching between contacts and glasses.  She's supposed to be sort of nerdy (not very convincingly played in that regard, for better or worse), which would be associated with myopia more than anything.  But I do think there was a scene or two where she had the glasses clipped on her shirt or dress or something...If I'm not imagining that, then she was just going bare-eyed in these scenes with somewhat compromised vision (also not demonstrated in any way)  Maybe astigmatism, low-minus...conceivably plus.  But they aren't used to provide any sort of vision-related situations; they're just used as a device to try (and fail utterly) to give Hewitt's character the "nerdy" appearance. </p><p> </p><p>Hewitt's glasses are nice plastic frames of the shape that seems to be really popular right now -- rectangular but taller on the outside and narrower on the inside.  Personally I think it's a lousy shape...it looks OK on someone as beautiful as Hewitt, but it doesn't help someone's appearance like a good shape can (IMHO). </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, the movie is somewhat entertaining.  I think Hewitt was really funny and engaging (despite mediocre directing).  But it's no masterpiece.  For one thing, it's painful to watch Jackie Chan have to hold back on his stunt performances because he plays a 'normal' guy in the movie.  Plus he's a lot better at martial arts than he is at dramatic acting.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2002, 11:18</p><p>OGL,  Thanks for the info on Tina Fey, I was about to catch one of the reruns on Comedy Central and she wore her black glasses with Conan.  She didn't say anything about them during the interview, basically her and Conan just talked about the Emmy awards and Saturday Night Live.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2002, 07:03</p><p>Tina Fey was on Conan O'Brien last night, too late for me to stay up, but his show is usually re-run on Comedy Channel about 5:00 Central (U.S.) time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>S-type</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2002, 06:35</p><p>I think in later episodes when she was older she got contacts. So we see her at three stages in her young life: bare eyed before getting glasses; with glasses; then in contacts. She is TV's unsung best case GWG.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KYGL</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2002, 17:05</p><p>Back when the Brady Bunch was on the air, I bought a magazine that had info about the stars.  According to the mag, Eve did indeed have to get glasses in real life, and so they were written into the show.  But she only wore them a year or so.  I'm not sure if she got contacts or just groped her way through the rest of the series!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>S-type</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2002, 06:16</p><p>Yes, I read where Tina Fey is a real GWG. On SNL she wears contacts and plano glasses for the "news" portion. As she also plays other characters on that show as non glasses wearing.  </p><p> </p><p>RE: On the original Brady Bunch Show, does anyone know for certain if Eve Plumb (Jan) really has glasses? My memory of that show is dim but I think her glasses were real minus lenses. She needed glasses in RL so it was written into her character because the studio couldn't put CL's on a child her age and in those days only hard lenses were available?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2002, 20:28</p><p>Back to Tiny Fey.... I saw her on TV at the Emmy Awards and she wore those same black glasses that she wears on Saturday Night Live and wore in the people magazine picture a few weeks ago..  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2002, 11:48</p><p>Who is Aly Landry? Any pix available? Anyway, as I posted elsewhere earlier, I have fitted post lasik customers almost on a daily basis, and monovision is pretty rare.  whether you've gone mono or not, additional low minus is very often the norm.  I remember one lovely 29 year old who'd gone from somewhere around -4.50 to what she thought (and probably was at the time) was plano.  Two years later the symptoms surfaced, I fitted her with OD -.50 sph -.50 cyl and OS -.50 sph -.75 cyl and she had the usual reaction of a first time low minus wearer. We laughed when I suggested and she admitted that this was probably the same as her very first correction when she was in 3d grade!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>S-type</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2002, 05:29</p><p>Aly Landry had Lasik but on one eye only. (right one I think) I guess its because she can't wear CL's and she is pushing 40 and would otherwise soon be need reading glasses. It seems from TV she can get by with her permenet monovision at most times. But on that dare devil show she was on she had to put on eyeglasses for one event that involved distance seeing. So I guess she still needs glasses for driving, certainly for night driving and watching TV and movies. She is not much better off like this. If I were her I would get the other eye done and go with the readers.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>yan</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2002, 11:58</p><p>Hi! </p><p> </p><p>Here`s a little hint for all the people who are able to watch german TV. Yesterday there was a movie called:"Wen küsst die Braut" pn PRO7, featuring a very sexy real gwg in a supporting role. She wore her glasses for the entire movie, exept from a scene where she put in her contacts for a while. The glasses/contacts where even needed for the plot. Her presription was between -2 and -3Angela i guess - and I`m pretty good at this. The actress is called Angela Sandritter (Susanne-role).  </p><p>And the best news is: It`s gonna be repeated on Thursday 19th at 9.05 in the morning (german time). So get your VCR`s ready. IT`s worth it. You`ll get about 15 Minutes of her, acting pretty nearsighted. </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.agentur-reuter.com/PMain.php?paramdo=vita%A6mid=19%A6mfotoid=116" target="_blank">http://www.agentur-reuter.com/PMain.php?paramdo=vita¶mid;=19¶mfotoid;=116</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GwGs</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2002, 08:29</p><p>S-Type you read my mind, i was just about to mention Lynda Carter, aka Wonder Woman, i was sent a couple of pics of Lynda with her real glasses on, and boy did they look strong, talk about myopic, the circles in the lenses were amazing, and the lenses looked about an inch thick! But in Wonder Woman she wears all be it a lovely selection of glasses but they don't seem to have the power her real ones do - maybe she is aware of this, and does what lots of fantasize about - Glasses over Contacts - she wears prescription contacts, and tops up the prescription with her glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Do you think she does this, or is just me dreaming?!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>S-type</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2002, 07:55</p><p>Yes there are many shows where the character wears glasses and so does the actor in real life. On some days of filming the actor prefers to wear contacts and planos are employed. At other times when not, realRx lenses are installed in the frames so the actor can see. The show 'Wonder Woman' with the nearsighted actress/ contact lens spokes person Lynda Carter is a prime example.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2002, 07:36</p><p>And how about this one: in the old "Life Goes On" series, Kelly Martin often wore glasses (as she does in real life) but sometimes they were plano and some times you could see the minus. In some cases, the plano and the minus were the same frames.  And in the current hit Left Wing, er, excuse me, that's West Wing, Allison Janney plays the White House Press Secretary with a pair of small plastic frames that she wears down on her nose almost like half eyes.  The problem is, they're for real minus lenses, but she reads through them and then looks over the top for distance.

In all other scenes they have no glasses on. Like what's up with this? Are the directors brain dead to this? Or do they want the audience to think the character wears contact lenses most days even though has nothing to do with the story line of the film. What gives?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2002, 06:35</p><p>A couple of nights ago, there was a special on the old tv series Cheers, and it traced the back ground of the actors. There was a fabulous clip of Shelly Long when she was just starting out with the Second City improve troupe in Chicago, she was wearing pearl white cateyes and even though they were plano she looked soooooooo cute!  Then (and this should be over on musicians but I'm too lazy to go over there) The Dame Edna mess was on, Nana Mouskori was the featured guess and there were some great closeups of her large trademark plastic frames that really showed the minus in her lenses. Near the end the Dame presented her with those huge masks without lenses and being a good sport Nana modeled them, unfortunately without squinting, then put her real ones back on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;09 Sep 2002, 10:34</p><p>Looking at the biography in the link to the Seventh Sign, all the way at the bottom it says Demi wore an eyepatch when young because of surgery.  This is consistent with amblyopia, a stronger lens now on one side, and the grainy black and white I mentioned earlier of her as a young girl.  Curt, can you provide a good link to Now And Then showing her glasses?  I'm not a very good navigator on those sites..... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;09 Sep 2002, 09:50</p><p>That would be "Now and Then"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;09 Sep 2002, 08:42</p><p>Flithy, Guest, et al:  Demi Moore is one of my favorite GWG in plus lenses.  Her left eye isn't too bad (maybe +1 or so), but her right eye is much stronger (+3 or +4).  This can clearly be seen in "the Seventh Sign", but also in "Now and  Again" (?) and especially in "Nothing but Trouble"; there are some good caps out there of her riding in the car and in the early part of "Nothing but Trouble" out there on the net. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2002, 15:34</p><p>Dummy Moore also wore plus glasses in that movie with Jurgen Prochnow about the end of the world.  It was called The Seventh Something, but not Seal, since that's Bergman.  Seventh Day? Anyway.  I think it was in a standard scene in these 'ancient prophecy' movies where exhaustive research by the main character (often in a dim room in front of a mirofilm reader) leads to a stunning realization of the cosmic significance of his/her predicament. </p><p> </p><p>The movie kind of sucks, and she's kind of boring at best, but a glimpse through a real Rx on the screen always results in a bit of (unintended) erotica.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>S-type</b>&nbsp;03 Sep 2002, 14:51</p><p>Actress Renee Zellweger, I just learned wears glasses but has contacts on most of tht time. I always thought so because she has that funny look to her eyes, the way many people who wear contact lenses do. I heard she is thinking about LASIK because of all the hasseles with CL's but has backed out of getting the surgery several times and fears it wont work for her. I hope she gives up on the idea and even limits her contact lens wear and goes with some cool black plastic butterfly rectangles or ovals.    </p><p>PS: any photos of her in \0-0/ and does anybody know her Rx?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;02 Sep 2002, 15:42</p><p>Awhile ago someone asked if the glasses that Tina Fey wears on her weekend update show from Saturday night live were real. Well there is a picture of Fey in the September 9th issue of People magazine wearing glasses at the U.S. Open. The picture is on page 22.  It appears that the SNL glasses are not props like someone suggested but actually real.  The glasses she had on at the U.S. Open appear to be a similar style to the glasses that she wears during her weekend update show.   </p><p></p><hr>

There was a Playboy licensed frame made in those days, I am the proud owner of three of them, they're fairly large squarish ones with a moderately dropped temple and the Playboy bunny logo on the temple where it joins the frame front.  Two of mine have never been rx'd, and the third has an upper medium minus #3 brown bifocal sunlens in it.  Over the years there have been lots of photos of GWGs in the magazine, particularly their "back to college" issues, but always featuring prop dark bookish frames with plano lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GWg's Rule!</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2002, 01:10</p><p>Rimshot, I remember that movie, it actually was called "A Dangerous Woman".  Deb was wearing glasses throughout (except for the sex scene; GWG's only keep their glasses on in porn movies, it seems) and switched from plastic glasses to powerful high minus specs at the asylum at the end of the movie.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rimshot</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2002, 00:34</p><p>Howdy from the Sheraton, </p><p> </p><p>Oscar: How about a pic of  Rebecca Cooke. </p><p> </p><p>Forget the Greek Wedding if youre looking for thick minus lenses and more.  It could have been a great opportunity to track on film the development of her failing vision since early childhood.  Then, how she rid the specs for contacts to insure a better future (this much is in true Hollywood form).  But since all that wasnt the focus of the show she got planos and a hefty Greek bod.  Meanwhile I was gagging on after 65 perfume and  polite theater laughs . . . My pic of the week would be Terms of Endearment (Blockbuster). . . Deborah Winger (The Other Woman).  I could have picked it up used at my fav out of town record store but opted  to appreciate an image of her wearing specs on the jacket cover .  Its been years but I recall an infrequent hefty minus.   Talk about reality show . . . Terms was made about 20 years ago- The Other, mid 90s?  Im sure Winger had at least one or two good increases within that time period.  In the  last scene of the later film,  family and kids visit her at the care center . . . a young mother wearing wire frames and thick lenses . . . looking lovely . . .  </p><p> </p><p>BTW   Me Myself and Irene . . . currently on HBO . . .Renees character looks at the jet from the car while wearing specs fitted with a telescopic lens.  Ouch!  Their appearance is so quick and unexpected that it should count as an extraordinary Sighting. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2002, 16:37</p><p>Thanks for all the info on the film. Sounds like an all-too-typical "gee, I'm a swan" situation. But I still might try to see it as it looks quite entertaining. </p><p> </p><p>Back to the lovely Rebecca Cooke in the swimming. I hope other gwg watchers have seen this charming, pretty and clever girl in her minus 5-ish glasses? She's completely delightful. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>TC</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2002, 10:05</p><p>Yeah, I saw this movie a while back with a friend.  As soon as the movie started and she was wearing her spex I leaned over to my friend and whispered "I bet you $100 she looses those by the end of the movie..."  Wish she would have accepted that bet... *grin*</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>still</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2002, 19:14</p><p>Well, what I'd like are pictures of Maricarmen Regueiro, in her role in the telenovela made in Venezuela(I think), called "El Desprecio". In it she wore glasses through most of this Dallas-like soap opera. Her co-star was Flavio Caballero. I'd imagine that you'd need vidcaps to fulfill my request, because I have found pictures of the actress, but none from her in that role.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adalle</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2002, 09:48</p><p>I'm looking for pics of an actress named Elyssa Davalos. In one of the "Herbie" movies (i think it was "Herbie goes bananas", 1978) she played a girl named Melissa and she wore beautiful glasses. Not that they were real but still they were great. I have searched everywhere and the only thing I've found is the poster of the movie. Later she had played on some MacGyver episodes but she did not wear any glasses there. Of course I'm looking pics from the movie where she wears glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lazysiow</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2002, 12:04</p><p>Lol this sort of isnt about actresses either but I recently found an anime (japanese animation) series called "G-On Riders" and it's about young schoolgirls (what else? :D) who possess the power to SAVE THE WORLD!! from alien invasion. This power is the love, strength and PMS in a young girls heart all rolled into one which can only be harnessed by the G-On invention, which are... a pair of glasses specially made for each girl. This power manifests itself in the form of a sword which represents the girl in some way.  </p><p> </p><p>It's a silly show :) but they fight giant pokemon things in order to defend the earth from the 'space aliens' who always attack the same high school in Japan go figure :D All the girls in the school are GwG's and theres hardly any shots that don't feature a piece of eyewear, there are a few shots of them cleaning their glasses, blowing into them to clean too.  </p><p> </p><p>The I dont think the show would really appeal to fetishists, its just about silly cute girls in their glasses with some perversion in between :) If anyone wants they can email me at lazysiow@excite.com and I can give you FTP details of how to get it, you will need the Divx codec of course.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;14 May 2002, 06:22</p><p>I realize that the doctored photos are just that, and that one still doesn't get to see the lovely effect of cut-ins, etc.  As someone (I think it was Fathom) pointed out, this is more to answer a creative "What if?" question, to get the imagination going.  It would seem that you also feel that the Stories threads would be of little interest to most members on this board, because obviously most of those are not about real people wearing real glasses...fictional characters are certainly less real than ELizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn. </p><p> </p><p>If you are saying that, on this particular thread, one expects 100% genuine sightings of actresses with real glasses on, I will be happy to change my postings to another thread, if you can suggest a more appropriate one.  Otherwise I will continue to post here, and you can just not look at the photos. </p><p> </p><p>Don't worry about tact or hurting my feelings.  I didn't do this project for any other reason except to put my favorite actresses in glasses to see what it would be like, and then I put it on the internet and if anyone else wants to see it, fine.  My statistics indicate that some people are enjoying, and that since I posted yesterday, either 12 people have come and looked at every single photo, or more people have come and looked at some.  That's more than sufficient traffic for me. </p><p> </p><p>I'm probably never going to put anything up there except 50s and 60s movie actresses, for my own purposes, but if anybody else has a celeb, male or female, that they want this done to, just let me know and I'll be happy to put it up. </p><p> </p><p>Satin Doll</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;13 May 2002, 10:18</p><p>SatinDoll:  Let me be as tactful as I can about this...I'm glad that you take an interest in glasses.  But what you are doing probably doesn't interest most of us here.  We are interested in REAL people wearing REAL eyeglasses, not taking Photoshop or some other program and artificially placing glasses onto a picture of someone who was not originally wearing them.  I mean, what purpose does it serve??? In most cases, the doctoring of the photo looks obvious, or like the 1990's frames on a 1940's picture of Liz Taylor.  Photo manipulation can be lots of fun, but at least from my perspective, I would rather see someone in their real prescription glasses - If they don't wear glasses, bummer!  But adding glasses to their picture doesn't change the fact that they don't wear glasses.  I obviously can't speak for everyone here, but these kind of doctored photos are boring to me anyway...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;10 May 2002, 23:12</p><p>I am always seeing new things in old movies. Faye Dunaway in The Thomas Crown Affair (1968) does a scene in which she is studying a photograph of Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen). She is photographed horn-rimmed half glasses with plus lenses, which she then takes off and moves closer to the photograph, using them as one would a magnifying glass. There is then a close in shot of the photograph as seen through these glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Miss Dunaway was 27 years old when this movie was released. She is not playing an older character, nor do these glasses appear in any other scene in the film. There are, however, a very nice array of period sunglasses worn by the star and various other glasses worn by the minor characters.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fathom</b>&nbsp;10 May 2002, 19:17</p><p>GWGs - not being from the U.S., asking about Congress is very understandable (I'm from Canada myself, where it's not the term we use either...).  Technically, Congress refers to both the upper and lower house of the U.S. legislature.  But most people use "Congress" in the vernacular to mean only the lower house (House of Representatives) and use "Senate" for the upper house.</p><p></p><hr>

Interestingly enough, that picture is (I believe) taken from the Varilux web page.

If my memory serves me right, today was the only time I have seen Ladd sporting specs on Charlie's Angels.  I really hope drop temples come back into style.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glassez luva</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2002, 17:18</p><p>Another Tuesday, and another episode of The Real World.  I can't wait for another potential sighting of Tonya in glasses.  Aneesa is almost always wearing glasses, and Keri sometimes sports them also.  I am surprised so many cast member wear glasses this season.  Out of the eight cast members, I have counted five wearing glasses.   </p><p> </p><p>Also, does anyone have any pictures of Tyra Banks in glasses.  I have seen her on TV wearing glasses at a basketball game once, and she also wore them on the celebrity version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.  I am assuming that her specs are real, because I remember seeing an old school picture of her in glasses as well.  I wonder what her perscription is?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glassez luva</b>&nbsp;14 Apr 2002, 16:48</p><p>It sounds like Alison Sweeney may have sporting her real life specs, if she was wearing them because of contact lense irritation. </p><p> </p><p>It seems that actresses seldom wear there real life specs on TV or movies.  Can anyone recall any movies or TV shows where actresses actually wore their personal specs?   </p><p> </p><p>I found it interesting, that when I came across a website concerning tip for fashion modeling, that it told potential models not to wear their personal glasses to photo shoots.  What if a particular model can't wear contacts?  I personally would love to see more models sporting specs.  To me glasses on a woman make her appear more confident, as if she knows her beauty cannot be diminished by her specs.  And as far as I'm concerned, beauty being diminished by glasses is impossible. </p><p> </p><p>Also, does anyone have any glasses pics of Charlize Theron.  I remember her sporting specs in an interview a few years back.  Very sexy!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Spec Watcher</b>&nbsp;14 Apr 2002, 14:10</p><p>Alison Sweeney, who plays Sami Brady, wears contacts in real life.  In the last week, she did many crying seens.  My guess is that she could not put in her contacts after those crying seens, and that why she was wearing glasses.  She also has worn glasses in the past.  But her wearing glasses is a very rare event.  So you just hit in on the right day. </p><p> </p><p>I agree, she looked absolutely beautiful in those glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob</b>&nbsp;13 Apr 2002, 22:22</p><p>I tuned in to "Days of our Lives" on Friday. The soap opera on NBC. </p><p>I haven't seen it for about six months.  </p><p>I was hoping that Chloe was wearing her glasses again. She wasn't. </p><p>But I was delighted to find that Sammie Brady wore glasses every time she was on. And she looked absolutely stunning in them. </p><p>Does antbody know anything about this?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glassez luva</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2002, 15:38</p><p>I did not realize that Meg Ryan wore specs in real life, assuming the pics in People magazine are of her in real glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Eyeman, you're right Tonya from Real World is one hottie.  Keri and Aneesa are pretty damn sexy as well.  I remember one episode where Tonya referred to the fact that she couldn not get a good look at one of the house guests because she had taken her contacts out. </p><p> </p><p>I was a big fan of the Celebrities with Glasses website.  I am really sorry that it no longer exists.  It would be great if somebody would start another one.  It's a shame that it looks like many female celebrities are turning to Lasik. </p><p> </p><p>Does anybody have any glasses pics of the sexy Daisy Fuentes.  I remember her stating in a TV interview that she often where her glasses instead of contacts when she is not on TV.  I have seen her in many dark glasses/or sunglasses pictures, but it's just not the same as real glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Another (maybe GWG) is Janine Turner from Northern Exposure.  I remember her once remarking in an interview that as a young model, she was so upset about being lost in New York City that she cried so much her contacts fogged up. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, I gotta go, I am watching the Real World/Road Rules competition on MTV.  Jisela, a former Road Rules participant is so sexy in her glasses, that appear to have a relatively high prescription.  I like reality TV shows for the mere fact that they show so many women in glasses, since they are practically being filmed 24/7</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2002, 15:01</p><p>I just saw the new movie Sorority Boys. First off, this is a bad movie, that's probably not worth your time. But, on the good side, the lead female character, played by Melissa Sagemiller, wears really cute black frame glasses all through the movie. She even wears them at the end when she and lead guy get together and everybody lives happily everafter. I think there are probably two reasons she wears glasses, one good and one bad. The good reason is that her needing glasses explains why when she's in the shower (and not wearing glasses) she can't tell that the guy pretending to be a girl is really a guy. The other reason kind of goes back to the usual stereotype we see in movies. She is the president of the ugly girl sorority. Since this actress is really beautiful, I suppose the only reason the script writers could justify her being in the ugly girl sorority is to have her wearing glasses. But it didn't work. With the glasses, or without, she was better looking than the girls in the rival pretty girls sorority. But after all that, unless you just want to go to see the girl wearing glasses, I'd wait until this movie comes out on video.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2002, 14:15</p><p>HA! - I was waiting for that to happen GWGs.

I bet at least one other newspaper follows suit - and no newspaper will have the guts to say the opposite!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GwGs</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2002, 13:29</p><p>Another article about girls with glasses, this time it's in todays (Tuesday's) Dailt Telegraph (English newspaper), headlined by Nicole Kidman, it also features Liz Hurley, Jennifer Aniston &amp; Anastacia. </p><p> </p><p>Press cuttings of it will soon be on my site - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://www.gwgs.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.gwgs.co.uk</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2002, 00:53</p><p>Z3 - There was some comment in the piece about Nicole Kidman having developed nearsightedness over the past four years. She had the LASIK - but maybe her nearsightedness hadn't finished increasing - and maybe the LASIK dudes were too impatient to get their hands on a hot celebrity and lots of $$$s! Anyway - the bottom line seems to be - LASIK is not all it's cracked up to be. And the bottom line for me - Nicole Kidman is one hot babe in glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2002, 16:00</p><p>I haven't seen the pics, but if the vision in her two eyes were now somewhat different, going without specs might give her headaches. </p><p> </p><p>But this is pure spec-ulation! bwahaha *chortle*</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Z3</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2002, 14:57</p><p>... but I just don't get how - if she wasn't that shortsighted to start with -it was so unsuccessful that she *can't* now go without correction .....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2002, 13:31</p><p>Yeah, you can bet NK had the very best of the best operating on her, too. </p><p> </p><p>I don't do a lot of LASIK bashing, I think the risk might be worth it for some people, but it certainly makes you wonder. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe she's just waiting for the 'tune-up' operation.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Z3</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2002, 12:58</p><p>The dear old Daily Mail ... I'm not at all sure they've got this Nicole Kidman story right.  They say she had Lasik and it wasn't 100% successful so now she either wears contact lenses or glasses.  But didn't we have a conversation on here recently that reckoned she was never more than -3 to start with?  Isn't Lasik supposed to be pretty effective for that sort of prescription?  I thought so.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2002, 09:04</p><p>I ain't read the Daily Mail for years - but I made an exception today! Yeah - Nicole is a stunner in specs - and it was good for the reporter to give it his best shot. So how often does a Girl With Glasses get on the front page simply for wearing glasses? That might be the first time ever! As for Page Three as well - without even having to strip to the bare essentials - that's quite something! I prefer the slight sideways view inside the paper to the full face view on the front page. For those elsewhere in the world - you better hope some kind person with a scanner copies the pics and emails them to you. Not me though - no scanner!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2002, 06:23</p><p>Ive read the Daily Mail article.Front page news indeed ! </p><p> Another thumbs down for Lasik it seems. It said the treatment had not been completely successful and she still needs some minor correction and usually wears contact lenses. My recollection was that she was never particularly shortsighted in the first place so to go through Lasik and STILL need contacts/glasses says it all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Smudgeur</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2002, 00:55</p><p>She's on the front page of the Daily Mail in the UK wearing specs, with a full story on page 3. Apparently the LASIK wasn't totally successful and she still requires some correction. </p><p> </p><p>She looks stunning!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2002, 07:56</p><p>It appears all the talk about Nichole Kidman having LASIK may be rumor.  There are a bunch of photos on the wireimage.com page of the SAG Awards last evening, and she is wearing specs in many of them.  Hurrah!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>myofan</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2002, 15:35</p><p>Found a Hamill pic at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://i.timeinc.net/people/images/specials/olympics2002/watn/dhammill.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.timeinc.net/people/images/specials/olympics2002/watn/dhammill.jpg</a> </p><p> </p><p>Not the greatest picture, but it gives you some idea of the frames she preferred.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>spexalot</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2002, 10:04</p><p>Her hair style was called the Hamill wedge. Her skating technique was called the Hamill Camel. In an interview on the Phil Donnahue show, she fielded questions from the audiance. One woman asked her Dorothy to remove her eyeglasses which she wore on the show. Dorothy did so and exclaimed "now I can't see you" </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>spexalot</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2002, 09:28</p><p>yeah, I remember interviews of her at the time. She couldn't wear her contacts on the ice rink because of the ammonia released by the ice had bothered her eyes when wearing lenses. she practiced wearing glasses but when it became show time she went out there bare-eyed. And she said her memory of winning was just a big blur. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2002, 09:08</p><p>Yes indeed. Large frames with the sort of plastic used for lenses in the 70s would mean quite thick edges for a minus 4. She's extremely pretty without them, of course, but the specs would really do it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GwGs - again</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2002, 08:51</p><p>Wurm or anyone, where can I find pictures of this Dorothy Hamill, I tried google but it didn't find any of her wearing glasses, please help as I'd love to see some of her with the much talked about oversized frames. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2002, 08:30</p><p>"Hamill set off another fashion trend in the 1970s -- glasses with oversized frames. Nicknamed "Squint" because of her bad eyesight, her huge glasses were first bought in the summer of 1971. Coach Carlo Fassi discovered her eyesight problem and told the optician to make the biggest frames possible so Hamill could see out of the corners while doing figures." </p><p> </p><p>from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812230513/http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_hamill_dorothy.html" target="_blank">http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_hamill_dorothy.html</a> </p><p> </p><p>Hamill also briefly had her own line of frames (oversized, of course).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2002, 07:24</p><p>GwGs:  Thanks, that one works much better.

<p><b>spexalot</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2002, 06:09</p><p>Dorothy Hamill won the gold in the 1976 olympics. Her famous hair cut was called the Hamill ....something or other, I don't remember. But it seems every other girl in that era was getting that cut. She also wore large frame eyeglasses of about -3.50 to -4.00. And then she started doing commercials for Bauch &amp; Lomb soft contact lenses which she started wearing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>spexalot</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2002, 06:00</p><p>Yes, Dorothy Hammill. A cute myopic, rich DEB. from Connecticut. Who could really skate. She Married one of Dean Martin's sons. Today she is doing TV commericals for arthritus medication. She has "lost" the glasses though. I don't know if she wears contacts now or has had LASIK surgery.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chocula</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2002, 05:21</p><p>Chris Witty is her name. </p><p>And yes, what was so memorable about Dorothy's glasses was the size of those awesome large plastic ovals. </p><p>And her famous haircut. </p><p> </p><p>Another observation. I am sitting here watching the Today Show. I am very disappointed in Katie Couric lately. I can't remember the last time I saw her wearing glasses. What a pity.. pout</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2002, 05:18</p><p>GwGs:  I'd love to take your little quiz, but that link doesn't work!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2002, 05:16</p><p>Chocula, </p><p>Right you are, Dorothy was just gorgeous in those big glasses, even had a bit of strenght to them, I would guess in the -4 range (be still my heart) which she wore quite often.  The best I've seen from these olympics was the skater, last name Witty and I don't remember her first.  I was too busy looking at her in glasses to pay attention to her name.  I agree, Sarah Huges in glasses.  WOW!! She is so cute, all she needs is a nice pair of ovals, a -8 or -9 and she would blow the top off the thermometer...  Oh well, I guess it's OK to dream.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chocula</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2002, 03:46</p><p>I noticed the same thing about both the male and female skaters. </p><p>But since I am a heterosexual male I am only concerned about the female. </p><p>I think that Sarah Hughes would look totally adorable in glasses. </p><p>That obviously brings to mind the #1 GWG Olympic skater of all time, Dorothy Hamill. What a babe!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GwGs</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2002, 03:15</p><p>Being bored @ work I came up with the idea of having a picture of a couple of girls with glasses with just their eyes and glasses showing.

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2002, 06:12</p><p>JT: I often just comes from years of lenswatching.  With friends, I would make a mental note as to what I thought their prescription was, and then later ask them to see how close I was.  I used to be a lot easier; high index lenses have made guessing minus prescriptions much more difficult.  You used to be able to make a bit of a guess from the thickness of the edge of the lens, but, like I said, with high index lenses, all bets are off.  I recently guessed a friends Rx to within 0.25 !</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>spexalot</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2002, 14:41</p><p>Has anyone ever scene movies with Debi Mazar wearing glasses? She is a real life myope of about -4. One film is "Girl 6" and in another movie with Gwenneth Paltrow where Debi played her best friend and wore rimless frames with a minus Rx.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2002, 12:28</p><p>Alan:  The actress you are referring to in the Medicine Man is Lorraine Bracco, now on the Sopranos.  I believe on Lenslover's site (Smudge Report) there is a short essay on women wearing glasses in movies - titles the Good, the Bad and the Ugly if I remember correctly.  Medicine Man was listed under the "Bad" for just the reasons you mentioned  Even though Lorraine is nearsighted and her glasses have an obvious - prescription, she puts them on to look at the computer, read, etc.  I like the movie, but the OO in me was bugged by her use of glasses.  "Roxanne", with Daryl Hannah (one of my absolute favorite actresses), on the other hand, is, for lack of a better term, optically correct.  Daryl is a hyperope in real life, and wears her + lenses whenever she reads loveletters, etc.  She does, however, slip on her + lenses (around her neck on a chain) when she and Steve Martin are moving her telescope up a long set of steps --- anyone remember that scene?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2002, 23:04</p><p> </p><p>This week-end I watched the movie "Almost An Angel" co-starring Linda Kozlowski.  She wore low minus glasses in most of the scenes.  A must see for GWG fans.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2002, 18:59</p><p>In "You've Got Mail", Jean Stapleton (a.k.a. Edith Bunker) wore obvious minus glasses for reading.  She portrayed a bookshop employee, Meg Ryan being the employer.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2002, 12:30</p><p>Teachkids and Spexalot, </p><p>    What an actress wears in a movie isn't much indication of what they do in real life, I don't think.  I remember an actress in some movie quite a while ago -- The Medicine Man, or something like that, maybe -- who would put glasses on for reading in the movie, but not for other things...yet the glasses had a fairly strong minus prescription...strong enough that I'm surprised she could act both with and without them.  (Maybe she removed some contacts in between takes when she put the glasses on...I don't know.)  It was pretty funny.  Anyway, I'm (almost) sure they were her real glasses, but the script called for her "looking smart" by putting on "reading" glasses, so that's what she did.  Most of the world seems to have no sense of how different prescriptions look...maybe some vague notion of whether or not glasses are strong, but that's about it. </p><p>   Point being -- Meg Ryan could wear weak minus glasses in real life and put glasses on in movies in order to give some kind of impression the director is looking for that doesn't really make sense for the actress' real Rx.  And most actors and actresses probably wear contacts anyway, aside from the ones who have had Lasik. </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>teachkids</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2002, 11:36</p><p>No- I am almost completely sure that Meg Ryan wears specs for reading. I have seen her in many movies and they appear to be + lenses. Also, she always wears them only to read. I have seen evidence of this in a couple movies; mainly: When Harry Met Sally</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;22 Jan 2002, 12:05</p><p>GwGs:  As I said to someone else earlier, photos taken from directly in front of a person (like the Cindy Crawford pix) make it very hard to guess prescriptions.  There is no way to see the degree of magnification or minification through the corner of the lens, or the # of concentric rings for minus Rxs.  Her eyes look a little bigger through the glasses, so they may be + lenses, but it is really hard to tell.  Wish there were more pix of her wearing specs</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SZ6</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2002, 13:50</p><p>When I saw "Not Another Teen Movie," they had a preview for another teen/college sex comedy flick called "Sorority Boys," in which three guys, for some reason or another, join a sorority on their campus disguised as girls.  The female lead is a really cute bespectacled blonde, and there's a scene where she's nude in the bathroom without her glasses, someone comes in, and she squints and says something like "Who is that?  I can't see you, I don't have my contacts in." </p><p> </p><p>I may have to see that one despite its questionable quality!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Daventhalas aka Ray</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2002, 12:42</p><p>I saw a movie over the holidays that really disguested me.  In the "Princess Diaries" a movie designed to be a self-esteem boost to girls and young women, there is a scene where where they are giving the girl a make-over and the scene goes something like this. </p><p> </p><p>Stylist: Looking at her in her glasses, "Do you ever wear contact lenses?" </p><p> </p><p>Girl: "Yes, but I really prefer to wear glass-" </p><p> </p><p>At this point the guy takes her glasses off face, snaps them in half and tells her that she has know choice but to wear contacts now. </p><p> </p><p>That scene almost made me sick.  Here is one of those rare women who comfortable as is and someone is trying to take that confidence away from her.  She also had long super curly, another thing I really like, and they cut all that off saying it was the worst hair he'd ever seen.  This movie takes the "girl loses glasses and become a babe" thing way too far.  I have a six year old daughter who wears glasses and will have to for life and I do not want her to see this movie ever.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2001, 13:30</p><p>jj:  When pictures are taken from directly in front of someone's face (like the link you posted), it is almost impossible to guess the Rx.  The only way (that I know of) to make a semi-accurate guess is to see how many concentric rings there are in the lens from an angle, or to see how much minification (for minus lenses) or magnification (for plus lenses) you can see through the corner of the lens.  This has also been a problem with every picture I have seen of Katie Holmes --- they are done straight on or at such an angle that you can't actually see through the lens of her specs.  Darn! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2001, 01:45</p><p>Further to my last post on this topic - way down below on 17th November - I've just been to see "The Others" with Nicole Kidman.

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2001, 17:47</p><p>I agree about Kidman and actors who like glasses.  Really, I don't even think a person has to be an OO or have a glasses-fetish at all to like how someone looks in glasses.  People just seem to think they look bad...it's very sad.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Angie</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2001, 12:04</p><p>I really think Nicole Kidman should have kept her eyes the way they were. It wasn't like she was blind and it was like a comfortable RX. What a pity. I guess they have a reputation to keep yeah. But if there are so many people like us then don't you think that there are male OO's? I mean like famous actors that wish that actresses would wear their glasses more. I do. I am sure they just don't say anything. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2001, 12:44</p><p>Wurm,  </p><p>   Yes, they say "I" look ugly in them, but do they say "she" (the girl with the really cool glasses across the room) looks ugly in glasses?  I was talking to one of my friends recently, and I asked her whether she thinks I look better with glasses or without...she said "with".  I was actually a little disturbed, because she seemed very certain about it, and it almost made me feel like I would be putting myself at a disadvantage 'attractiveness-wise' if I didn't wear my glasses.  But dispite her positive view of *my* glasses, she insists that she "doesn't look good in glasses".  (She doesn't have to wear any, either, so I guess her basis is only other people's glasses she has tried on, which presumably didn't fit her face that well.  But she might be getting a little nearsighted...so maybe she'll have to really find out.) </p><p>   I just think there is a weird double standard between how people view others in glasses verses how they view themselves.   </p><p>   I'm curious what the reaction will be to Sidewalks of New York, where Heather Graham appears to wear glasses in most of the movie.   </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2001, 05:18</p><p>Wurm:  I meant it only partially in jest.  There is an attitude in Hollywood and in other areas where the "beautiful people" are that glasses are not attractive.  This is hardly a revolation - it has been talked about for years.  Among the group of people who post here, it is certainly not the case...but I truely believe that the general attitude  (in the US anyway) is that a person is less attractive with glasses than without.  I don't believe it, but I hear it from women time and time again that I  discuss glasses with. They always say "Oh, I look ugly in them!"...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2001, 16:04</p><p>I suspect Curt's comment was made with tongue planted firmly in cheek. </p><p> </p><p>However, with more and more people comfortable with wearing glasses these days, I hope that will translate to more sightings of celebs in glasses. </p><p> </p><p>As much as I like dramatic eyewear styles, the current retro specs have probably helped get more people out wearing their glasses without thinking twice about it. I think people find one or the other among small round, small oval and rectangular frames quite wearable. There isn't a strong bias for wire, plastic or rimless either and that may also be helping.</p><p></p><hr>

I saw a trailer for that spooky movie - 'The Others' - in which she would have been ideal as a glasses wearer. The movie is set in a spooky house with all the curtains drawn and low lighting - and she spends some of the time reading. If that doesn't add up to a need for glasses - then I don't know what does. But all the bits I saw had her bare-eyed - which was a pity.</p><p></p><hr>
