<p><b>Hansel</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2004, 10:07</p><p>How did I get to start GOC?  </p><p>Simple really, I wear CLs most of the time, my optician suggested that reading spex would help. Initially I bought a pair of +1.00 "ready readers" rom the optician. Then I bought a pair of +1.00 from him that were made up. I feel these are better quality lenses. This process began about two years ago, although I have to say that I have now a concern about the business practice of this particular optical establishment. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2003, 10:54</p><p>Lisa -- I think the question about your 'natural' prescription came because you said you do glasses-over-contacts and it was a little confusing.  Could you verify/clarify the prescriptions you mentioned in your post before (+18 and -3.75) -- they don't really make sense, or something didn't make sense.</p><p></p><hr>

I told her that the opticians were making new faceted lenses for my glasses so they stick out so much and i was giving contacts a go. </p><p> </p><p>She revealed her prescription and i couldn't believe it was +18, she also said her vision was that good for distance and had been prescribed a -3.75 prescription for.  God i thought, those lenses looked thick, but what had happened to her over the last two years to make her wear varifocals with such strong prescriptions for both near and farsightedness. I didn't ask as it would have been rude but was very intrigued. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, she stayed the night round my house a few days later and when she was asleep i went into her bedroom to find her glasses on the bedside table. </p><p> </p><p>I put them on and i could see extremely clearly, clearer than i could with my normal glasses. I sat and watched for an hour or two then went out to get some milk (still wearing her glasses) and couldn't believe how clear everything was. </p><p> </p><p>I put her glasses back when i got home and she never knew. </p><p> </p><p>Now i'm hooked on GOC and so glad i've found a place i talk about it!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2003, 03:17</p><p>As an old member of this community, a moderator (i.e. one of several) of Glassesovercontacts Yahoo group, and a founder of two such groups in another language (the project failed twice) I can say that there are some women who are interested in GOC and a few of them probably occasionally wear GOC for recreational purposes (for fun). I do not count those, who wear GOC as a real optical aid that helps them see and enables them to wear thinner glasses, of course. </p><p>I cannot tell any number as it would be a pure speculation. There are female GOC wearer, but they are very scarce. They should be protecte by UNO.</p><p></p><hr>

What percentage of the universe of GOC wearers/fanciers are female. The percentage would seem to be rather low. Would someone in the know here care to offer an informed guess? Thoughts appreciated. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ebay fan</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2003, 12:13</p><p>hey, you can sometimes get new + and - contacts on ebay, they are normally 'dailies' but I have cleaned dailies for a few days and they are still fine... Thought this may be an idea for some people</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;21 May 2003, 21:15</p><p>Well, SC, I doubt that anyone has a supply of unopened contacts.  And to trade lenses that have been worn by someone else is downright dangerous, and irresponsible.  However, if some of us were to get together, and say we discovered a common brand, and eye size - like 8.9 base curve, and 14.5 or 14.8 diameter, well then I could see no problem in exchanging unopened lenses.  One of my problems in the past has been the ordering of many different prescription contacts once I found a supplier.  So, it would be easier if you and I had the same eye size, and I could use my address and a different prescription for each eye to order 2 pairs of different powered lenses.  Then you could do the same, and we could trade the unopened bottles.  Although, right now I am pretty well supplied, so I am not in the market, but I am sure there is likely others.  The best place for this discussion might be on Bobby's Yahoo groups glassesovercontacts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>UKoo</b>&nbsp;21 May 2003, 14:02</p><p>Does anyone know of an optician in the UK where glasses and contacts for GOC can be purchased via an understanding optician?, even if under the guise of for film theatrical work etc.I have plus 6.5 approx presc, but would like to do GOC with say minus 15 to minus 20 with CR39 lenses in large frame so as to maximise effect! Any and all suggestions gratefully received                    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SC</b>&nbsp;19 May 2003, 09:42</p><p>I have thought of doing GOC too. The problem of finding contacts is difficult though as many people have said. If people from this wonderful site have contacts which many do and perhaps like me have daily disposable ones etc people may want to share/trade some to make life easier. Anybody willing to do this - help out our fellow eyesceners?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;15 May 2003, 14:44</p><p>GwGs - I just ordered some from www.spectaclesgb.com </p><p> </p><p>Although I have a current prescription, it would be easy to get a fake one because all they ask is if you have a current prescription but they make no request for optician's details.

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;18 Dec 2002, 09:12</p><p>Re the "kick" out of GOC, here are a couple of other reasons.  Yesterday went GOC shopping, and then stopped at a nice upscale mall bar for a pint. Lots of X chromosomers there,and it's easy to take of the glasses and clean them, make a comment about "I just got these and boy do they make a difference far away" etc. which usually sparks a good conversation about our favorite subject.  It's for that reason I usually wear low minus for those occasions, more than once they've asked to try them on and been able to see better. </p><p>Or, my favorite ploy, worked perfectly yesterday.  Was only operating around 2 to 3 diopters overplussed and found a discount chain with only one female working and which had a Snellen chart on the wall.  Squinted at the chart, asked how far away I was supposed to be and how far down I should be able to read, etc. (of course wasn't wearing the glasses, a wonderful blur) and she gave me the whole distance screen bit. I then asked if any of the glasses around the store had "distance" lenses and she said no, but that I was probably like her (she wore contacts) and could try hers.  She disappeared into the back room and came back with her old round gold metal frames, -2.75 and -2.50 and said I should try them.  Of course, I oooooohed and awwwwwed about the clarity, proceeded to read the Snellen down to the 20/15 line, and a good time was had by all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stan</b>&nbsp;13 Dec 2002, 02:51</p><p>From dictionary.com: </p><p> </p><p>weird (wîrd) </p><p>adj. weird·er, weird·est  </p><p>1) Of, relating to, or suggestive of the preternatural or supernatural.  </p><p>2) Of a strikingly odd or unusual character; strange.  </p><p>3) Archaic.

<p><b>Stan</b>&nbsp;13 Dec 2002, 02:32</p><p>S4E, I think I would have my Rx at about -10 to -12 plus a couple D of cyl. This is my favorite look in a scrip, where it is very strong, but  not yet biconcave, just thick and/or strong plano base curve lenses. I actually like even more myopia than that, but that is the Rx range of glasses that I prefer.  </p><p> </p><p>On topic, I got started in GOC as a natural progression of the search for blur. First I tried overcorrection to my limits for years. When that did not produce the desired amount of natural myopia I went to reading glasses, then combined multiple sets of plus lenses. That gave me the blur I was looking for, but could not be worn out of the house. That gave me the idea to use plus contacts, and once I had those it was just the next logical step to "correct" it with stronger minus glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>I was always pretty close at guesstimating the GOC Rx combination needed, but after I started reading ES, the Dr. M spreadsheet proved helpful.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>myofan</b>&nbsp;12 Dec 2002, 12:09</p><p>Yessir, I salute you, Specs4. </p><p> </p><p>I really wanted Ms. IIII to be real, and fervently hope she was.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;12 Dec 2002, 07:57</p><p>I too have been hanging around here for many years myofan.  I remember Mrs IIII's postings well, and I remember thinking that I wished she was for real. There have been so many great posters, and so many who I wonder who they really are, and why they do it. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;12 Dec 2002, 07:54</p><p>Hey Stan, we do not disagree, I just phrased it different.  While we can always pop out the contacts, and see again, I try not to be in a position where I have to do that.  I remember opening the back doors of a loaded semi one evening, and a bag of foam fell on me, knocking my -18D glasses off.  Sure, I could have popped a contact, and put it in my mouth while I found the glasses, but I wasn't ready to end my GOC for the day, so I searched for the glasses, and I found them, luckily unbroken.  The feeling of helplessness was great.   And, we both agree on the idea that we would like this to be a permenant state, although I have a really hard time deciding what my prescription should be. </p><p>I also agree with you on the reason for the move from liking GWG's.  For me, at first I found all girls more attractive to me with glasses.  Then I realized that there were so many girls, so many glasses, so I began to notice the ones with the thicker lenses.  As I tried on many pairs of weak minus lensed glasses, I found that I could make myself see through them, so I started to search for girls who wore glasses that I couldn't see through.  Also, a very attractive girl often wouldn't give me the time of the day, as I was a bit shy, whereas a pretty girl who wore glasses was more inclined to be friendly.   So, as my attraction increased, so did my desire. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>myofan</b>&nbsp;11 Dec 2002, 08:44</p><p>Ms. IIII's exploits can be read in their delicious entirety in the old EyeScene polls, if you have downloaded those (right now I can't remember which kind soul here made them available).  She first appeared in Poll 73 and described how she liked the look of wire frames because they show lens edges so well, then in polls 74 thru 83 she decides to try GOC, orders and gets contacts to bump her prescription from her "puny" -7.5 prescription (her description) to -18.25.  She really likes the glasses and is surprised how good her vision is through them, but is disappointed that the lenses have a "clear area" around the edges, which sure sounded like myodiscs to me.  Later I'll see if I can dig up the link to the polls if you missed them.  It's been pretty exciting,  watching EyeScene since nearly the beginning.  A great ride.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;10 Dec 2002, 18:32</p><p>Myofan, I have been here for awhile but have no recollection of the person you referenced in your most recent post. If it is worth reviving, please give us details.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>myofan</b>&nbsp;10 Dec 2002, 08:53</p><p>Portia, </p><p>I was wondering if you've been around here long enough to remember the story of Ms. IIII, who wanted to become a "high myope babe" and called her -7 prescription "puny".  She finally got + CLs and -15 (or so) glasses, and was not thrilled with the fact that they were myodiscs.  Last we heard she had some relationship troubles connected to her fetish, which is too bad.  It made for fascinating reading for sure.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2002, 21:01</p><p>The last few posts have been very interesting. I haven't done the GOC bit yet although I have imagined what it must be like and thought that I might do it if it were easy. Mostly I want to be able to try out lens combinations I think would help me see better than that which the usual "eyecare professional" is willing to prescribe. I have changed prescriptions in my favor and not been disappointed with the results. </p><p> </p><p>I have enjoyed reading about GOC though, and might be amongst the few females who find GOC of interest enough to try if it were readily available.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2002, 17:29</p><p>Stan: we are NOT weird, especially when you consider the nature of some of the fetishes that have been identified by the psych world.  We are, however, in the minority as opposed to, say, lingerie or high heel fetishists. And, the problem is compounded by the fact that we have all suppressed our feelings over the years in pursuit of "normal" behavior.  Actually, who knows how many of us are out there?

<p><b>Stan</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2002, 17:18</p><p>Tony, </p><p> </p><p>* I would likt contributors to tell me what it feels like to walk out on the stret with G.O.C.  </p><p> </p><p>Feels great. However I don't get to put enough time into it to become accustomed to the Rx, so everything always looks a little curved and imperfect, like when one is adjusting to a real Rx change. </p><p> </p><p>* What kind of kick do you get out of it?  </p><p> </p><p>There have been several threads about why we get off on the glasses/myopia/hyperopia thing. Whatever one's reason for that is, I presume is the same kick they get out of GOC. For me, I like the high-myope gwgs and the concept of their dependence and vulnerability. Somehow, placing myself in the same condition has a similar effect, especially if I encounter the gwg and we have this in common. Also note that I am not interested in hearing aids, braces, wheel chairs, hooks, etc. like some of the other optic obsessives are. </p><p> </p><p>* Do you feel like a person who is genuinley heavily reliant upon glasses because of th reverse C.L.'s?  </p><p> </p><p>Yes and no. I disagree with S4E on this point. For the moment you are myopic and you can wear strong glasses and see a blur without them, but any time you need to you can pop those contacts out. For me this makes a significant difference psychologically and that is why I would like to have refractive surgery to increase myopia permanently. </p><p> </p><p>Another thing you can't do with GOC is walk into an OD's office and get a refraction as a high myope. </p><p> </p><p>* How do people react to and percieve you?  </p><p> </p><p>Just like a they would to a real myope. It can go either way. I was amazed one time when a guy at a bar told me my real Rx (like -5 at the time w/ 57mm CR39s) was the strongest glasses he had ever seen (I just laughed and laughed to myself). I have also been amazed many more times when people have totally ignored a couple high minus GOC combinations I have that I consider to look very conspicuous. </p><p> </p><p>There is a skill in picking the right Rx for the reaction you want. I have some nice 55mm -9s with plano base CR39s. These probably get noticed more that my half-inch thick biconcave 58mm -13s. I also have some -18 myopdiscs and they don't get noticed as much as I anticipated. I think that beyond a certain point, people regard you as crippled or retarded and ignore you, trying to be polite. </p><p> </p><p>* Does it give you a real buzz?  </p><p> </p><p>Definitely. </p><p> </p><p>* Are you glad that you can see quite well without glasses in reality?  </p><p> </p><p>No. I wear about a -3, which is almost nothing. It just whets the appetite. As I said, I would like to have refractive surgery to increase my myopia. </p><p> </p><p>* Is this such a wierd thing or do you thing that the average personwould find it interesting to do this if it was sugested?  </p><p> </p><p>I think this is a very wierd thing. I think the average person would say someone doing this should seek counseling. Many out here, myself included, used to think we were the only one who thought of this. Now that we all know we are not alone, there are still perhaps only a few dozen in the world who are into this. I think that qualifies as wierd.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2002, 17:12</p><p>Specs4ever and The O.G.L. - Thanks for your replys which are very interesting.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2002, 15:30</p><p>specs4's comments about the buzz, the clarity, the blur, etc. are exactly how I feel doing GOC.....and that's at relatively low levels of induced myopia. Of course, relative to specs4 just about everything is low by comparison.  I've wandered around at 20/200 Christmas shopping the last couple of days, have stopped and chatted with a couple unknowing young female opticians without wearing any glasses myself and pretending to never have worn them, and that's fun.  One of them offered me a pair of -4.00 demos saying they might be a little to strong but if they helped I probably needed an eye exam.  Right.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2002, 11:13</p><p>One more point Tony.  I think, if I could do it, I would have my eyes corrected so that I would be a permanant glasses wearer.  My favorite prescription is around -18D, as this is a prescription that one has many options - ranging from myodiscs, to very thin hi index glasses, to thick biconcave plastic lenses.  So, you can appear to others to be as blind as you want to be.   </p><p>Also, one time I suprised my optician, as when i tried on my very very strong glasses, i could read the writing on her diploma on the wall.  Her comment was that she couldn't even do that with her glasses, and she was only -5 or so.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2002, 11:09</p><p>And, Tony, when you are doing this, it is exactly like you are a person who is dependant on your glasses.  When wearing a -18D prescription, whether you are doing GOC or not, you are dependant on your glasses. And, yes, I get a buzz out of it.  I also feel that anyone would enjoy doing this.  I really like taking off my glasses, looking at the world in a blur, and then slowly sliding them back up my nose to the point of perfect clarity.  I have also found this to be very addictive - at least to me </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2002, 11:05</p><p>Sorry Tony for not answering your questions.  I am kind of tied up most of the time these days, as I no longer have my own private computer, on which to type away, without fear of being discovered.  So, I restrict myself to reading the posts, with an occassional reply, just so that people know I am still around.  I enjoy wandering around people wearing very strong glasses.  I sometimes think that once in a while someone notices, but for the most part, I am just an old gray haired guy with strong glasses.  Occassionally I will, when wearing strong glasses, try to comment positively to other glasses wearers, particularily women.  I really don't know what sort of thoughts run through peoples heads, or if they even notice, as I have had to call attention to my own glasses from time to time by asking people to read something on a fast food menu board, or, if I am in a bookstore buying a pocket novel, I might say something to the cashier like "Glad my eye doctor can't see me buying this book." Then there is often a few good minutesd of conversation about my poor vision. </p><p>Another place where I really enjoy doing this is around optical stores.  Often I wander in with a screw loose in my glasses, or a lens that has popped out of one pair, and if the optician is a pleasant young female, the resulting conversation is quite interesting.  I have had to be careful though, as one time in Michigan I was having a great conversation with the optician, and just before I made a hasty exit, she told me she was the store doctor, and she would love to refract me for free, as she had never examined anyone as nearsighted as I was. </p><p>But, for the most part, I just like the appearance of being very nearsighted, and wearing the proper glasses over plus contacts is a great way to do it.  I find that I have absolutely no trouble adapting to my combinations, although right now one of my favorite pairs of glasses is giving me trouble, as I found out that the contact lenses that I was wearing when I ordered the glasses must have been off power, as I have been unable to get the correct contact lens as a replacement.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2002, 09:02</p><p>Anyone with any thoughts on what the G.O.C. experience is like?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2002, 07:50</p><p>teah, I do this a lot.  Mostly with +12c/l's, and -17 glasses, for a diference of -5D, due to the distance between the eye, and the glasses.  So, I figure that my minification is about that of a -5D myope.  I don't have a problem getting used to the various levels of minification.  Often I wear +17.50, and -28.50D glasses, and the minification is more noticable, butI figure it is only that of a -11D myope.  Anyone else have any thoughts on this?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>teah</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2002, 18:41</p><p>i have question to add -- how do you adjust to the difference in minification between the times when you go bareyed or with your regular glasses and when you go GOC. i suppose that among some of you the difference must be signficant!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2002, 09:00</p><p>Dreams about glasses? I can remember only one - and it dates back more than 30 odd years! Yep - that should give you some idea about how significant glasses were to me, even when I was bare-eyed. Anyway - one night I dreamed that one of my brothers was not only wearing glasses, but also had several pairs perched on top of his head! I remember feeling rather jealous because I didn't have any glasses and he had so many of them! In the cold light of dawn, however, neither of us wore glasses. Now is that odd or is it odd? </p><p>As for the Oedipus Complex - how about this one: "Mother, mother, I want to marry you!" cried Oedipus. "Over my dead body!" said his father.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2002, 17:03</p><p>Christy, </p><p>   Did Freud's theories ever really go out of fashion, any more than they are right now?

<p><b>Bubby</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2002, 11:14</p><p>Christy, what the heck are you talking about?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2002, 09:47</p><p>I don't know much about Freud - but I was once told that nearly all his theories were based on his observations of middle-aged neurotic women. Hence they might not be applicable to older or younger non-neurotic women - or for that matter of much relevance to men! However, I'm inclined to believe that there's a grain of truth in much of what he said, and although some of his theories are regularly squashed, they have a habit of becoming briefly fashionable again. I wonder what Freud would have made of this site?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2002, 09:43</p><p>Sometimes I wonder what people really mean when they talk about a "fetish". While I was away from home I stayed one night in a place that was full of strangely-shaped teapots and a vast number of barometers. The lady of the house obviously enjoyed collecting them - but said "teapots and barometers are a fetish of mine." Somehow I think she meant something else! She also wore glasses - though that is incidental!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2002, 21:26</p><p>Lore, you can write about anything here. Your skill at expressing yourself in English is a delight to read.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2002, 18:42</p><p>Lore, I read the text. Yes it is interesting, but it does not help to answer the questions we all have. I do not think we will find the answer soon.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2002, 07:05</p><p>Bobby, </p><p> </p><p>Oh, I'm not agreeing with Freud's theory of the fetish.  But, it does still tend to be quite influential. </p><p> </p><p>There is a lot of recent work that deals with fetishism, and a lot of it is in response to Freud.  Ann McClintock as an essay on postcolonial and colonial fetishism in her book "Imperial Leather."  I haven't read this one, but there is a book called "Female Fetishism: A New Look" by Lorraine Gamman and Merja Makinen that is supposed to be quite comprehensive.  And there is an online article available on female fetishism at <a href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/~psysc/uaps/fetish.htm" target="_blank">http://www.shef.ac.uk/~psysc/uaps/fetish.htm</a> </p><p> </p><p>Personally, I think it is a fascinating subject, even for non-fetishists like myself, although the fact that I do work in literature, especially psychoanalysis and feminist and queer theory probably makes it a bit more interesting to me than to most readers :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2002, 06:58</p><p>I don't know much about Psychoanalysis but Freud's theory just doesn't seem like commonsense. Maybe he just met somebody who he thought acted like this and assumed everybody else did. </p><p> </p><p>Here's a thought. I read somewhere recently that men have much more focus to their vision, looking at one thing only instead of the entire view. Maybe during sex and courtship they focus on the one thing that gives them the most pleasure, surely a self-reinforcing thing until it becomes a fetish. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2002, 04:54</p><p>Lore, thank you for the answer. </p><p>I read a book where this theory had been presented, I also read Freuds Introduction Into Psychoanalysis. </p><p>He made a great work, however psychology has made a substatial progress since the time of old daddy Sigismud. </p><p>Fetish is obviously not what he thought it was.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2002, 18:45</p><p>Bobby, </p><p> </p><p>You asked this a long time ago, but the reason that we tend to conceive of fetishists as male is because, in the traditional Freudian formulation of the fetish, the fetish is a way of disavowing the knowledge of woman's lack of a penis.  Since women already know they lack a penis, it doesn't happen. </p><p> </p><p>According to Freud, the fetish object comes to stand in for the missing phallus; it's the male's way of dealing with the recognition of women's "lack."  Usually, in his view, the fetish object is whatever was glimpsed immediately before the coming-to-knowledge of women's lack of phallus.  It is, in effect, a substitute phallus. </p><p> </p><p>While there has been substantial revision of his theory, and a growing body of work on female fetishism, Freud's forumation is still pretty paradigmatic, and that's why we imagine most fetishists are male.</p><p></p><hr>

Women either do not identify some of their feelings as fetishistic or they do not tend to be fetishists as often as men do. </p><p>I have been thinking about the topic for  some time, but I could not find any answer. Some sites made by sexuologists say males are more often fetishists than females, however I have not found the reason why. </p><p>All of the GOC wearers here are males. The only female who said she was into altering her vision was the founder of the glasses-over-contacts yahoo group. As she just started the group and stopped managing the discussion I am not sure if she is real. The other "female" is the "myodisc_Carole" who is probably a male pretending to be female.  </p><p>I think, we will not get reasonable answers to our questions until a sexuologist or psychologist joins our community. </p><p>I also think that this community is monitored by a psychologist or a sexuologist. I do not think the this lurker will ever tell us who he or she really is, because it might influence the authenticity or our discussion. </p><p>This is my opinion. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>michael</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2001, 19:40</p><p>benn, </p><p> </p><p>My actual Rx is -1.0 OD -1.5 OS.  I use +4.25 OD and +3.50 OS with -4.5 OD -4.0 OS and see great.  I use +9.5 OD +10 OS with -15.0 OD -15.5 OS glasses and see great. I have +19 OD +20 OS contacts to use with my myodiscs which are -26.5 OD -26 OS.  I would have preferred stronger contacts, maybe +22 but +20 was the highest I could find. Good Luck </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2001, 17:58</p><p>Benn, </p><p>  If you want contacts to balance out the prescription of glasses, the conversion is +1 to -1 up to about 4D. After that, they gradually diverge more and more as the power gets higher.  Some people on this site have a conversion table you could probably have sent to you.  Or if you're looking for a specific power of contacts (or glasses), someone could probably tell you the corresponding Rx for glasses (or contacts). </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>benn</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2001, 13:47</p><p>OK, I have gotten contacts to my intermediate Rx with over glasses. Now I want to get the Rx stronger. Does anyone know the conversion? Is it +1 to -1. Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hard CL</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2001, 23:12</p><p>Hello all </p><p>          It's fascinating to me to hear about the different fetishes and such. I've posted here because it is the only topic that includes Contact lenses. I have a serious thing for women that wear hard contact lenses.(soft lenses do nothing for me) I think that perhaps I'm the only one.  There are plenty of glasses fetish sights but none for Contacts.  I must also admit that I love wearing hard contacts. I've got some scaring on one cornea and hard cls are the only way for me to obtain good vision.(Glasses don't work for me) </p><p>I'm sure this has something to do with my obsession but I remember being facinated by women wearing hard cls long before I started wearing them.  Does anyone else out there have a hard contact lens fetish? Don't get me wrong, All the women I know that wear hard cls also wear glasses so I'm sure not anti glasses. I'ts a wonderful thing when a women kicks off her heels, pops out her lenses puts on her glasses and gets comfortable. My only enemies are the Lasik Docs. Before they came along there were a lot more cl wearers! I'm always on the lookout for hard lens wearers. It's always an incredible thrill to study peoples eyes and find the lenses floating there.  I find myself watching actresses and news anchors closely. I'm always trying to see If they have that "hard contact lens blink ". I must admit I also am extremly amused by those that notice my lenses.  Many stare and cringe as they note the lenses moving around with each blink. I often hear "wow! those have got to hurt!".  I usually let them go on thinking that because most won't believe me when I tell them they don't. I used to pop a lens out and ask them if they wanted to put it in and see for themselves. I tried this quite a few times and I only had one person take me up on it. She put my lenses in and loved the way she could see sans glasses. Our perscriptions were similar about -3. She left for her next class and threw me her glasses not realizing I also needed the cls due to the scaring. I bumbled blind to my next class. When it was over there she was in a panic she didn't know how to take them out and she was finding out that yes they do hurt until you get used to them. I left her for one more period with the lenses in her eyes to get her back for leaving me blind. She got her own hard contacts a few weeks later. We ended up dating for almost 4 years. I love women tnat wear hard contacts. Any coments from fellow eyewear fetishists would be apreciated. If anyone knows of a contact lens fetish site I'd love to hear about it.        Hard CL</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Quatzyeux</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2001, 12:29</p><p>I got them from an optician, almost the 'normal' way, the difference being I had a fake prescription. Ophtalmologists here just print their prescriptions using a laser printer, I let you imagine how easy it is to forge one.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2001, 16:45</p><p>Quatzyeux:  Where did you get you new glasses?  Were there any problems in getting them?  Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Quatzyeux</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2001, 02:02</p><p>Hi all -- this is a the first time I am posting to the "new" eyescene... I am a bit confused and I hope this is the right thread. </p><p> </p><p>I just got my new glasses, in the -8 range. The GOC combination works ok, but I just made two mistakes: </p><p> - I ordered lenses with a 1.54 index and did not ask obout the Abbe value, and I get some chromatic aberration </p><p> - the frames I choose are a bit too small, this reduces the field of vision especially when looking down. </p><p> </p><p>This is the first time I have glasses made to my (fake) prescription, I guess I'll do better next time! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;12 Nov 2001, 20:31</p><p>spexfan... I just keep a few simple rules.  1) contacts are with me at all times. Either in my laptop bag, pocket etc.  2) I clean them every night alone in the bathroom.  It only takes a few minutes.  3) Weekly cleaning is done at work.  4) They come off whenever I visit the Doctor's office or some other place that my attract attention to the eyes.  And finally, I never discuss my myopia (real or created) with anyone that does not comprehend GOC's.  And I know a total of Zero people that can comprehend such a fascination.  The whole process makes me more determined than ever to somehow make my vision permanently nearsighted.. -26 OD/OS would be nice but I'd be grateful for even -5 OD/OS.  best...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;12 Nov 2001, 13:14</p><p>Finally got the toric contacts in the mail.  They are a pain to put in.  They are not as pliable as regular contacts, so they keep slipping off my finger when I try to insert them.  I suppose I will learn.  The vision, however, is great.  They make distance vision with the -6.50/-7 glasses very clear.  I am happy with them!  On a funny note, I was cleaning the bathroom floor and found the contact I thought I had washed down the drain.  After a week of being on the floor, it was dry and rigid.  I put it back in solution to see if it rehydrates!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>spexfan</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2001, 23:57</p><p>So Michael, does your wife know about the goc thing? It must be difficult to deceive someone who really wears a very similar rx to your fake one. Would be interested to hear more about how all this works at home.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2001, 18:10</p><p>Hey folks, Thanks for being so willing to satisfy my inquiries. I really appreciate all of your answers, i really do. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2001, 12:08</p><p>There appears to be several common broad based questions with regard to GOCs.  These would be 1) why does the wearer like them, 2) when did they start, 3) how did they start, and 4) when will it end.  For me, my interest in eyeglasses goes back to about 8 or 9 years of age.  It is nearly impossible to look back at the motivations then and arrive at a clinical conclusion as to why.  I believe that I wanted some vulnerablity in order to shake off the coming responsibilities of adulthood.  Frankly from the behavior of all of the adults in my life at that point I did not care to be saddled with adulthood.  Be that as it may, by teenagehood I was very attracted to girls with glasses but frustarted in not being able to acquire even a weak Rx.  Damn the 20/20 vision is what I felt 24/7.  I went as far as going myself (alone as a teenager) to Optometrist one Saturday afternoon seeing if I could fake an examination and get an Rx.  Of course I could not get it filled because my parents never knew I went!  I would go to the store and buy these off the shelf magnifiers and wear them.  Once I took some to school, pulled them out and began using them. I was determined to wear reading glassess surreptitiously at school. It was a rush to be sure but very frightening.  I learned that I did not know how to wear glasses just for reading.  I was dumb enough to carry them in my back pocket and got ridiculed for it so I stopped. Once away from home I was able to order a pair from a mail order house, the Rx was -10 OD, -10 OS.  I could not wear those because I had no contacts and did not even consider a GOC combination. I still have these hidden away.  By this time (age 23) eyeglasses were a powerful driving force both for my self esteem and in finding girls attractive.  I married a girl in part because she had great -4.0 lenses. Between then and now I have managed to obtain everyday glasses that are -4.5 OD, -4.0 OS. My vision is currently requiring only about a -1.0 OD/OS but I push my eyes in hopes of having them trend toward worse vision.  So to answer some of my own questions: why - to me its a sense of vulnerability that is comforting and it is very sexually appealing in a pretty girl; it started early in youth suggesting it may be part nature and part nurture; and it started awkwardly resulting in risk taking (self made Dr appointment and ridicule at school).  But thanks in great part to the Internet and this site at its previous location I learned about GOCs.  I was a quick study.  By Feb of this year I had obtained GOC combinations for a pair of eyeglasses that are -14.50 OD, -14.00 OS, my best acquisition, a GOC combination for -26.50 OD, -26.00 glasses utilizing lentriculated lenses (myodiscs).  For everyday use I have GOCs to go with my -4.50 OD -4.0 OS glasses.  Mind you I wear these everyday at home, at work, in public and in private.  But no one knows except me and the folks here.  As for my last broad based question, when will it stop, I believe it will not.  At least the fascination, the attraction, the desire to be extremely nearsighted.  But the GOCs will probably go away either when it gets to risky (like at home) or when it becomes too hard to get replacements. I was interested in Russel's post about a Dr. agreeable to prescribe the GOC combination.  Any further discussions on this possibility would be great.  Thanks to all for indulging me in this little bio.  If anyone is in the Seattle area drop a post here and maybe we can e-mail.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2001, 14:15</p><p>Cosmetic? Oh, no, my dear friends, thick glasses are not "cosmetic" tehy are EROTIC. For me at least. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2001, 12:12</p><p>Russell: I can appreciate the "good crazy". I call it freakiness, my son Chas calls it weirdness, but we are both a bit out of the main stream (and offer no apologies). Funky can be fun.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2001, 09:45</p><p>Actually, I guess I meant "crazy" in a good sense because I love the fact that I think glasses are cool.  I just wish that more optometrists were as understanding and as accommodating as mine!  (Of course, when he learns that I have self-prescribed, he may not be so understanding.)  As for the astigmatism I have, it is -1.  My regular glasses are only -.75 and -.50, but when my previous doctor prescribed reading contacts with distance glasses (a combo that definitely didn't work!,)  the astigmatism was -1.  I have no idea why--I had both exams within the same hour (with and without the contacts.)  So, anyway, I took the -1 prescription and put it in the toric lenses I ordered.  Now I just hope that they work well.  Does anyone know if toric contacts would be the same prescription as for glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2001, 09:38</p><p>I live in Houton, Texas</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>benn</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2001, 08:34</p><p>Russel, in what general area do you live?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2001, 06:17</p><p>Wurm, </p><p>   Good point, but there are some cosmetic things that there isn't much disagreement on.  Like not too many people think acne is attractive.  Many people seem to consider glasses to be like acne - a 'blemish'.  We really are somewhat rebellious, I think, though there's also a big industry trying really hard to make glasses "cool", and they've done a pretty good job if my sightings among very fashion-conscious local college students are any indication.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2001, 06:15</p><p>Thinking about it a little further, I think it's a positive thing that we admire something not commonly considered aesthetically pleasing. It provides an alternative to the prevailing code of attractiveness. </p><p> </p><p>This is a place we can discuss such things without boring or offending others. I think that's a good thing too. </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if thick lenses have ever had a mass desirability? Perhaps in Venice at some juncture? The San Francisco geek subculture is certainly large, and seems to prize them to a certain extent.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2001, 06:14</p><p>Russell, </p><p>   Well, yeah, I think we're a little crazy.  I think everyone has their quirks, and this glasses-stuff is ours.  But I also think a nice pair of glasses looks awfully good...and given a fascination for lenses, stronger ones look more interesting and "better". </p><p>   It really is amazing that some people will go to great lengths to avoid glasses, while others will go to great lengths to get them.  Sometimes even the same people -- I used to hate wearing glasses myself (though I've always been fascinated by them on other people) and contacts almost as much.  Now I love them.  Go figure.  People are just really complicated, and emotions are not fully logical; we're not crazy, really. </p><p>   Good luck with your new contacts.  How much is the astigmatism power?  I imagine if the brand, size, and base curve are the same, you should be totally fine...but if your doctor didn't see a need for astigmatism correction, I'm surprised you need it enough for toric lenses to help.  Maybe your eyes changed a bit, or you were having a 'good day' astigmatism-wise when you had the refraction for your glasses. </p><p>   I'm amazed that people don't notice glasses (or at least their strength and people getting new ones).  I always notice.  But I usually don't say anything.  I think there's some sort of cultural thing about mentioning glasses, as if everyone assumes that wearing glasses is a sort of painful thing and therefore can't talk about them because it would be embarrassing.  Almost no one has said anything about my glasses, even though they're really different from the ones I used to wear.  I really want people to notice -- I mean, I spent a long time choosing them (not to mention a lot of money), and when no one ever says anything, I almost (but not quite) wonder if it was a waste.  But the effort and expense was really for my benefit and not anyone elses, so it doesn't really matter. </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2001, 06:08</p><p>Some of us enjoy the aesthetics of thick-lensed eyeglasses. That seems like a purely cosmetic decision, with no particular bearing on one's sanity.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2001, 23:28</p><p>Alan:  the lenses are quite thick--about 5 mm.  My doctor consulted with the lab technician to let him know that I didn't want anything that would minimize the thickness.  They sparkle beautifully!  You asked if anyone had said anything to me.  The answer is "no."  It is my theory that most people don't notice glasses.  If I had gone from -.25 to -15.25, then I suppose my friends would notice the difference.  But a jump to -6.50 didn't register with anyone.  In fact, I bet that most of my friends didn't even notice that I have new glasses.  And I won't be able to wear them for at least a week!  Here is the sad tale:    I suppose that when my doctor did the refraction, for some reason my answers indicated that I needed no correction for astigmatism.  I emailed my doctor about two weeks ago,  telling him of my problems with clarity.  He finally answered today to tell me to call him, that he could do something about the problem.  But here's a new kink in the rope-- I washed a contact down the drain today!  So, since I had not heard from my doctor, I thought he was ignoring me.  I went online and ordered replacement lenses.  I say lenses because I noticed the same brand he had prescribed offered toric lenses.  I used his specifications for the contacts, adding the astigmatism correction I got from a glasses exam with another doctor last June.  The company asked for my doctor's name and phone number, but I would bet that they ship them without verifying the prescription.  Anyway, after I had placed the order, I got the followup email from the doctor.  I felt compelled to reply and tell him what I had done.  I had vowed to myself and to him that I would do no self-prescribing, and yet that is what I have done, albeit I only combined two recent eye exams.  We shall see what he has to say about it all, plus we shall also see if the new contacts correct my problem.  I hope that they do because if they don't, I will have to go back  and bother my doctor again, and at this point, he may be pretty sick of me!  Right now, I am seriously wondering why people like us have such a "thing" for glasses!  There are so many people out there cursing their thick lenses, or worse, having laser vision correction, and here are many of us at Eyescene reveling in our thick lenses and even wearing contacts to achieve the thickness!  Are we crazy?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2001, 20:35</p><p>Alan, </p><p>I wear them most of the time; however, when working on computer hardware or when I'm teaching (related to computer hardware) I often remove them to be able to read the fine print and see some of the small components more easily. </p><p> </p><p>My glasses have a 3.50 add for reading so I don't need to remove them for most normal reading; however, I have kept my old glasses which I usually use as computer glasses which makes things on the computer screens easier to read.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2001, 16:06</p><p>Specs4Me, </p><p>  A question: is it true, what you said about needing to see small computer components and such, and therefore wanting to 'be nearsighted'? I mean, of course you really wanted the GOC so you could experience the blur and wear the strong glasses, etc.  But do you find it useful at work, or do you just leave the glasses on all the time you're working? </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2001, 16:03</p><p>Russell, </p><p>   I might have asked you this before (quite a while ago), but did you get polycarbonate lenses, or regular plastic?  And do you know the eyesize?  I'm trying to get a sense of how thick they are... </p><p>   Anyway, I'm kind of envious -- I have been looking at rimless glasses a lot, and I really like mine, but I've noticed that they seem to look a lot better with stronger prescriptions.  They are really indistinct and almost disappear with weak prescriptions, whereas there's a girl in a class I'm taking who has probably -5 or -6 rimless specs, definitely a high index (they're not very thick, but definitely thicker than my -3.5) and they look SO good.   </p><p>   So, did you have much reaction from people after you started wearing them?  I'm pretty sure that with my prescription, I could move to something like yours without really being noticed. (Actually, since I'm young, I could probably do it without contacts.)  Just can't afford it right now...rimless specs are pricey. </p><p>    Hey, why didn't your doctor correct for astigmatism?  He did do a refraction.  I guess he assumed you didn't need it, and didn't even check ???  Strange. </p><p> </p><p>      Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2001, 21:32</p><p>I started full time GOC a year ago with CL's to allow me to wear L -5.5 and R -4.5.  I sold this to my Optom. because of the type of work that I do which requires me to work with computer parts with very fine markings.  I saw her the first of Oct. and convinced her to push the CLs so that I am now wearing L -7.0 and R -5.5.   </p><p> </p><p>I would love to go even higher but at this point I am not sure that I can sell her on the idea.  Time will tell.  </p><p> </p><p>I love my glasses and the bluriness when I take them off.  Maybe if I develop cataracts I can get the replacement lenses to be such that I can get to double digits...  Oh well, probably wishfull thinking.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ChrisB</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2001, 15:54</p><p>Tammy, </p><p>In answer to your question. </p><p>I have been doing GOC for nearly 2 years now, mainly full time (with the odd day off for good behaviour) </p><p>I too was encouraged by the example, advice and experience of others on ES. </p><p>I must stress that my GOC wearing, only takes my current reading addition of 1.25 as a CL, and adds to it a little astigmatism in the glasses.  </p><p>It took me two opticians before I could get them to agree to the combination. The argument was that my working day meant it was better to be wearing glasses to walk about than trying to find them each time i looked at a PC screen. I would love to go to something like -5, but I would need bifocal CLs to do that. My rx hasnt changed in the 2 years. </p><p>For someone who has  myopia it must be strange to find people who want to emulate it. I have a couple of friends male and female who have RXs in the -3 to -7 range and they are seriously considering Lasik - I keep telling them there's no point in taking the risk- just get long wear CLs.  </p><p>I also find it strange that now after two years friends and colleagues  see me as a glasses wearer!! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2001, 14:51</p><p>Alan,  </p><p>yes, I think so. The difference is very large and the effect is quite obvious. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2001, 12:08</p><p>Yes, I did get rimless glasses.  They are thick and sparkly.  I love them!  And I do wear them almost all the time.

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2001, 21:01</p><p>Bobby, </p><p>    You are apparently pretty nearsighted either without the contacts; do you feel like the extra +8 adds a lot to the effect? </p><p> </p><p>Russell,  </p><p>    Did you get rimless glasses to wear over your contacts?  I might recall reading about your story a month or two ago.  So you're wearing the GOC all the time?  Still like the glasses? </p><p> </p><p>-- Alan </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2001, 16:27</p><p>I started wearing GOC two years ago. Specs4Ever stories and my e-mails with Martin inspired me. I do not wear GOC every day. The frekwency is usually once a week.  My combination is +8 D contacts and -20 D glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2001, 09:57</p><p>I have been doing GOC for about six weeks now.  I had wanted to wear thicker lenses, but my degree of myopia was very mild.  For months, I searched out email addresses of optometrists in my area.  I would write them, explain what I wanted, then hope for an answer.  Usually, I was ignored.  Finally, a doctor replied and was willing to prescribe GOC for me.  I was not willing to try it unless under a doctor's supervision.  I went in to see him.  He was very open to what I had to say and we discussed what power of lenses I wanted.  We decided on the -6 range.  He tried +6 contacts on me, then did a refraction.  One eye refracted at -6, the other at -7.  I ordered both the contacts and glasses, and I have been wearing them daily ever since.  The doctor even emailed me to ask how I was doing with the combination.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2001, 21:31</p><p>Hi. I don't do GOC myself, but i am interested in finding out how people got started doing GOC and how long they've been doing it for.</p><p></p><hr>
