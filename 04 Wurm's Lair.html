<p><b><a href="http://eyescene.net/bbs/real.html" target="_blank">Wurm</a></b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2007, 20:17</p><p>Sure, go ahead and promote your board whenever you think it is relevant. If you want to take on stuff that doesn't seem to work here, that's great. I also understand that there will be overlap, and that's no problem either. </p><p> </p><p>Just don't overdo it. Maybe a post every week or two is OK with me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>focused.eye</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2007, 15:18</p><p>Wurm, should I offer the board I opened as an option for long winding discussions? I mean, as in the way the conversation with Rachel is very interesting to some, but others begin to feel uneasy and attack her. The board I opened would be best for that kind of thing. But I wouldn't offer it without your consent (I will not even post the link to it here).  </p><p>Also - I'm thinking about giving some other users (long time Eyescene collaborators) Admin privliges, so that it could become a shared project.  I must emphsize again, that my aim is not to replace Eyesce, but to enable a place for private discussions between several users, which don't match the static thread topics in Eyescene. </p><p>You can answer me here, or mail me if you want, at focused.eye@hotmail.com. Thank you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2006, 05:49</p><p>Puffin, </p><p>Excellent point.  I used a website just yesterday to order something and the font was almost unreadable. The font was one of those where the stroke in one direction was 1 pixel wide and about 10 pixels wide in the other.  It was nearly impossible to differentiate between an "X" and and "N".  Maybe that is necessary for very clever "bots".  Apparently, they were aware of the problem because they had a feature where you could LISTEN to the characters if you couldn't read them.   </p><p>Having very hard to read fonts would not be a good thing on a site devoted to vision. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2006, 04:29</p><p>But please don't make them too unreadable. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2006, 17:27</p><p>Wurm, </p><p>Maybe, you could add a feature where you must enter the characters displayed in a variable graphics field to submit a post.  I believe that is what a number of sites use to prevent machine submissions. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2006, 16:23</p><p>Yes on the Bot.  </p><p>Someone seems to be using a "forms" bot, that seeks pages with form entry. It's popping up on othe sites. </p><p> </p><p>unknown if anyone has to help it along. </p><p> </p><p>PITA!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2006, 16:05</p><p>I wonder if it's some kind of 'bot' that's doing it automatically.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2006, 15:08</p><p>I wonder what the point of dumping all this poker stuff here is. Could the originator please enlighten us?  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ted</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2006, 14:42</p><p>Wurm, it may be a minor inconvenience for us, but the advantages of this site far outweigh the posts made by a few idiots. Please keep up the good work.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2006, 12:25</p><p>I'm aware of the spam flooding that's going on in GOC, and in Site Feedback and News. It may be a couple of days before I can clean up the posts and institute some simple blocks. And it may be a couple of weeks before I can implement a more thorough solution.  </p><p> </p><p>So far it is not creating a bandwidth crisis that might take the site offline. I recommend using the <a href="http://eyescene.net/cgi-bin/threadsbypost.cgi" target="_blank">http://eyescene.net/cgi-bin/threadsbypost.cgi</a> index rather than the post index, for now. </p><p> </p><p>My apologies to anyone inconvenienced by this.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2006, 16:57</p><p>It says here we can talk about anything on this thread (even nonglasses-related), so I thought Id share my Most Recent Theory on the Meaning of Life, which is that Life Is all in your head. When we experience a person/ place/ thing/event, it is not really the thing itself we are experiencing, but rather our perception of it. We tend to think the physical world outside of us, the world of things we can sense, is the real world and the imaginary world inside our minds is not and that our minds exist primarily to allow us to act to alter the world around us. But, if you think about the fact that human minds can contain everything we know to exist in the physical world PLUS things that have never been seen, heard, or otherwise sensed by anyone, but only imagined, this idea becomes questionable. Maybe the real world is inside of us and the physical world (including, btw, our own bodies) exists primarily to affect us. Perhaps true reality is in our perceptions, thoughts and feelings. Which means that it is everything (including nothing) and much more unstable and readily alterable than we are accustomed to think. On a glasses-related note, this makes me think of something interesting-If my Most Recent Theory is correct, then maybe the world really is blurry and it is the (large but still minority, at least here in the US) group with perfect vision who are not seeing things correctly. Thanks for listening and now I shall return to contemplating my navel (hmmm, I wonder how long that popcorn kernel has been in there?).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2003, 08:48</p><p>i believe it's still there</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2003, 07:32</p><p>Truth is often stranger than fiction: </p><p>'The Myopia Hunt Club, so called because so many of the members wore glasses, was closely associated with The Country Club. Myopia leased a hundred acres in the vicinity of Hamilton.' </p><p>'The Myopia Hunt Club ball was, according to the Gardner Museum archives, "the handsomest, most elaborate entertainment given in Boston." The men wore their pink coats, "a splendid sight. Dancing did not end until 5 o'clock, the cotillion beginning at half past three." Again in 1888, the Myopia Hunt Club ball is described as the big event of Boston's season and Mrs. Jack was there in her pearls and diamonds. The ball was in the new Cotillion Hall in the Mechanics Building on Huntington Avenue, "where skins of tiger, fox and bear had been hung about the walls as though the hunting out at Hamilton had yielded a rather remarkable bag during the past season.'</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hearty</b>&nbsp;14 May 2003, 22:48</p><p>Wow, Wurm, those chunkies sound great, it WOULD be cool if you could get an extreme rx in them. Your ideas for the futuristic industrials, sound like what I am visualizing! Gosh, I'd love to have a boyfriend who would get into that kind of thing....and I'd say, "Honey, you must put on your correctional appliance now!!" ;) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;13 May 2003, 22:18</p><p>Safety glasses would qualify as industrial frames. Maybe sports and orthopedic specs, too. </p><p> </p><p>I have some drop-temple safety glasses (ca. 1980s) in a chunky brown tortoiseshell in my collection. Five-barrel hinge -- real classic clunky glasses. Shapely in their way, but also very orthopedic looking. Good fetish specs, I'm sure they would look outrageous with an extreme prescription! </p><p> </p><p>As for a new industrial design, hmmm: maybe something robust in an etched metal with bolts and spikes on it? Juggernaut specs.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hearty</b>&nbsp;12 May 2003, 23:38</p><p>Hmm, It's been so long I've posted, I forget if I'm Musey or Hearty??! Maybe  should think up a new name, for my new life, sans the drummer?? Something clear and lens-like. </p><p>Anyway, I wanted to share that tonight, around dusk, I ventured out to Dunkin' Doughnuts, without my glasses!! It was pretty frightening, the world looked like a mass of coloured lights and blurred, slanted smeary lines. Needless to say, I drove verry slowly, until I found the red reflector at the end of the driveway!  </p><p>So, where IZ everyone here?? This is about fetish and frames, there must be lots to say about that! I'm still coveting some rimless spex I saw at a Kennedy &amp; Perkins (my fashion/jewelry/sex-super-store) that had rounded temples in multi-coloured acrylic....talk about futuristic!  </p><p>I still want to design some industrial frames, has anyone seen any cool metal frames in that style??</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2003, 15:19</p><p>It's ironic that many astronauts come from an air-force background.  They are trained to attack targets and enemies.  Later in life they get the opportunity to be involved in something more, I guess, constructive. </p><p> </p><p>I think most Americans became sort of bored with the space program through much of the 90's and stopped paying a lot of attention to it.  But while all astronauts are, in my opinion, heros, these 7 are particularly heroic because their fate reminds us that these people are pioneers.  It's people like them that will lead us out of the "dark ages" that we currently live in.  The Europeans didn't call them the dark ages back in the year 800...the label came later, looking back.  I don't expect the present age to ever be called the dark ages, but I do expect that there is a future out there to be discovered, created, that could be very special.  But I expect it to appear only after much work, many travels into insecure territory, and great risk.  May we be as bold as astronauts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2002, 09:32</p><p>Musey - is this what you were thinking of? <a href="http://sci.esa.int/content/doc/48/2376_.htm" target="_blank">http://sci.esa.int/content/doc/48/2376_.htm</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2002, 07:57</p><p>Hi Musey, </p><p> </p><p>I think it's Saturn that is closer to us than usual. Only a low-powered (around 30x) telescope is required to view the rings. </p><p> </p><p>I haven't heard that anything special is happening with Mars, but I could be wrong -- I don't follow the astronomical events with diligence. </p><p> </p><p>As a seasonal side note, one theory about the Star of Bethlehem is that it was an unusual conjunction of planets (there were two of those events during the general time frame of the birth of Christ). Interesting theory, although I'd be more inclined to believe in either a supernova or a miracle.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Musey</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2002, 01:25</p><p>Wurmy might know this....it seems to me I heard that Mars will be the closest to us it will be in many many years. I wondered if that is happening now, or if not, when? And how will we recognize it, is it near the moon? Because I've been out howling at the full moon these past nights, the air has been so cold and pristine, and I thought I saw a reddish planet to the left and below the moon. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2002, 17:00</p><p>Nothing new there... Many of our nations leaders have belonged to "Skull and Bones" ...  errr.. that was suspose to be comforting....  guess not!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2002, 15:01</p><p>I've already made up my own mind about Skull and Bones (barring further information). My thinking is roughly along the same lines as Musey's: too much power is attributed to the group, but it gives one pause to reflect on the dark rituals some of these fraternal organizations foist on impressionable young men. In most cases the metaphor is travel through the darkness and into the light (illumination), which bears a grain of real truth IMO. </p><p> </p><p>I will say that the idea of a vengeful statue getting back at the pigeons is rather humorous.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Musey</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2002, 11:30</p><p>Yes, there's a lot of interesting info and maybe some unfounded connections too, but in my mind, it is an uncomfortable thought that the powerful in this country and elsewhere, are groomed in a barbed-wire, ivy covered and windowless building, with velvet walls, a pentagram and other Satanic and Nazi connections and/or past. (not to mention the dead pidgeons....)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Musey</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2002, 00:24</p><p>I might have gotten some of that wrong, but if you search Yale Skull and Bones Society, you get a ton of info on them, and lots of stuff about the new world order, the gulf war and German influences in the beginnings of the society. Very interesting, I think. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Musezilla??</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2002, 23:41</p><p>I just scanned the article as my daughter is gushing about her night out, tonight. But while I'm not that much into politics, it did bring to mind 'feelings' I've been having on this empire topic...nebulous thoughts I haven't really examined, but they're there. </p><p>I don't know if this has any basis in fact, but many years ago, I posted some notes about the Yale Skull and Bones secret society, because my brother-in-law had found some strange, ritualistic things in the building that they'd left unlocked one day. It has all this barbed wire around it, he was a grounds keeper and so had access to the grounds. He found a statue which he said looked like the grim reaper (to him) with bloodied pidgeons strewn around it, etc. Anyway, a few guys got on and posted that, in that year (I think it was when Clinton was running) al of the nominees were Yalies and had all been in that society, and wasn't even Gov. Brown a past Yalie?? Anyway, one guy said that he'd been a member, and that they have an agenda for a few former Yale and Skull n Bones men, to rule the world. I know it sounds kind of flimsy, yet back then twas true, all the nominees I believe, had been a member. Whatever, anyway I like to drive past that building and just look at it, spooky....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MVIII</b>&nbsp;04 Oct 2002, 08:18</p><p>I'm a bit disappointed there haven't been more comments about this article.  I'm wondering if the reason people aren't commenting stems from their shock at this whole "empire" building scenario.  It's almost unbelievable given the country's history.   </p><p> </p><p>If the Senate sanctions Bush's proposals that will be an even bigger shock.  Democrats have a thin majority there, so it's not likely.  If they do ratify, it will take the nation some time to let it all sink in.  Once it does, I think we'll see these policies rejected when voters hit the poles this coming November. </p><p> </p><p>I don't consider myself politically astute, so things could play out in a completely different manner.  If so, I would be more than disappointed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christyzilla</b>&nbsp;01 Oct 2002, 14:01</p><p>Did that article even need to be written? I thought the writing on the wall was couched in pretty much the same terms! I wouldn't be supportive of Empire-building - but then again - there's nothing I could do to stop it. The problem with Empires has always been that they're pretty well unassailable from the outside - but tend to get torn apart from the inside.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alanzilla</b>&nbsp;01 Oct 2002, 13:57</p><p>MVIII-zilla, that's a clever name. </p><p> </p><p>Yeah, the bookman article really is troubling.  I'm glad he wrote it, and I hope it gets a lot of attention. It certainly isn't the story Bush is trying to sell the American people or the rest of the world.  Bush has to come up with some good answers, or else (hopefully) he won't get his pet war funded. </p><p> </p><p>America as Empire doesn't seem like a real good strategy.  It breeds enemies we might otherwise avoid.  But then again, we're already good at breeding enemies.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MVIII</b>&nbsp;01 Oct 2002, 13:10</p><p>Bookman's article is both interesting, and troubling.  It supports my theory which asks the question: "Doesn't Sadam Hussein understand that if they strike first and "any" country sustains heavy losses, Iraq will be annihilated?" </p><p> </p><p>Personally, I do support "sword rattling," to support the United Nations gaining access for proper inspections. </p><p> </p><p>But, more than that, I do not support.  It seems like Bush The First back tracking and saying, "I didn't get it right when I had the chance.

Could be the biggest meteor display in decades for this region. </p><p> </p><p>Show peaks around 2am PST and 5am EST. Check your local weather report as you'll need at least some clear patches to see the meteors.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>slb</b>&nbsp;04 Nov 2001, 13:25</p><p>Olefin (or rahter Polyolefin) is a type of plastic so these are synthetic fibres. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Is that fiber made out of hog's fat or something? </p><p> </p><p>Well, as long as I'm not allergic to it, I don't really care. Must be versatile stuff though, as both my new rugs are made out of it and they have very different textures.</p><p></p><hr>
