<p><b>High Myopic</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2018, 15:06</p><p>Please let me know if you find that french eyeglasses company so i can see if i can order a +66 diopter pair of glasses in the largest frame possible. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>plus</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2018, 14:59</p><p>Soundmanpt neither my wife nor I wear glasses. These were the most unusual glasses I have ever seen. Each lens was like a marble set in glass. I only saw his eyes from the side, through the lens his eyes looked black in the shiny marble. When we moved rooms he asked to sit with the tablelamp behind him as he found bright light difficult. </p><p>We were all staying in the same hotel and as we left he was quite clumsy and bumped into a low table. His wife took his arm on the stairs. He is about the same age as me, 35. Sorry now we did not exchange addresses. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>High Myopic</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2018, 14:47</p><p>I looked up that site but they do not seem to make +66 diopter glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus Tony</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2018, 13:45</p><p>Soundmanpt/Plus </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if the lens manufacturer you were trying to think of is Essilor? </p><p> </p><p>I'm fairly sure they are French and they make a very wide range of lenses and offer some interesting coatings for different uses. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2018, 12:51</p><p>Plus  </p><p>I can't image how thick his glasses must be or how they stayed on his nose. Do yu or your wife wear glasses? I'm sure thta was the stronest glasses either of you have ever seen.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>plus</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2018, 12:09</p><p>My wife just got home. The company sounded like the petrol company esso or similar. Sorry cannot be more helpful. My wife thinks the man's name who wears the glasses is Jacques</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>plus</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2018, 11:37</p><p>Over Christmas we were in France and met a couple, the man wore incredibly thick plus glasses. We chatted to him about the glasses and he said previously he wore strong contacts and strong glasses over. With the new glasses he was able to see without the contacts. If my memory serves me well he had +66.5, +3 cyl and +67, +4.5cyl. he was very careful when he walked and his wife helped him down the stairs. His eyes just looked like black circles through the lenticular lenses. He had a folded cane in his daysac. </p><p>The lenses were crafted in France but I cant remember the name of the company. They were quite expensive. </p><p>They both worked in the UN office in Geneva. maybe trace him there. Worth a try.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>HighMyopic</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2018, 10:09</p><p>What is the name of that french company?  How much does the +66 and over glasses cost?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>plus</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2018, 10:02</p><p>A French company can make lenses in the over plus 66D range</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>High Myopic</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2017, 21:20</p><p>Where can I buy 16X magnification or about +64 diopter eyeglasses?   I really would love to wear a pair that is stronger than my +48 diopter pair.  Ian said that there was a maker in India that makes them.  Can I buy eyeglasses that are even stronger like +70 dioters?   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>High Myopic</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2017, 21:28</p><p>What do you think is the rx of these glasses?  I will be getting them in the mail.  </p><p> </p><p>https://i.imgur.com/t2K5ARw.jpg </p><p> </p><p>https://i.imgur.com/prHNIQ5.jpg </p><p> </p><p>https://i.imgur.com/rvZ5QVn.jpg</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2017, 18:33</p><p>Neville, </p><p>Both Hyperopia and Axial or True Myopia are caused by a mismatch between the total PLUS power of the eye's lens system and the distance from the back of the Crystalline Lens to your Retina.  If you have Hyperopia your Retina is too close to the Crystalline Lens for the total power of your lens system.  If you have Myopia, the distance is too far for the total PLUS. </p><p>Most children are born with Hyperopia because their eyeballs are very small.  As they grow, their eyeballs also grow as dictated by their genes and their visual environment.  Typically, eyeball growth stops around 20 to 25, but not always.  As the eyeballs grows, Hyperopia will decrease because of the laws of optics.  Ideally growth will stop at a refractive error of 0.00.  If growth stops too soon the individual will be Hyperopic and need + glasses.  If the eyeball continues to grow, beyond 0.00, the individual will will develop Myopia and need - glasses. </p><p>By the way, some of the numbers are amazing.  Typical Total PLUS power of an adult eye's lens system is about +59 diopters and the distance from the Crystalline Lens to the Retina is about 17 mm.  The distance is usually the critical factor in needing vision correction and the amount of external correction needed is about 0.3 mm per diopter of correction. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Weirdeyes</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2017, 12:48</p><p>Neville </p><p>Im kind of interested in doing some high plus GOC for a Halloween costume.  I already wear plus glasses, but my rx is too asymmetrical which annoys me. So I try to hide lens thickness and distortions and often wear contacts. My right eye is only +0.75 and my left eye is +4.25. I think my rx is ugly to even plus glasses lovers. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Neville</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2017, 12:16</p><p>As a kid I had bad eyesight but during my teens my Rx for hyperopia got less. Why I do not know? At uni in the late 60s early 70s I missed thick lenses but coincidentally became good friends with a trainee optician. He helped me, and still does, with GOC.  </p><p> </p><p>I has cataracts removed ten years ago and after a battle with the doctor had no IOLs fitted. So back to thick lenses. Love that even with obvious drawbacks.  </p><p> </p><p>My friend about to retire from his optician business has continued to help.  </p><p> </p><p>I only recently found this site and would love to hear from anyone who enjoys wearing or seeing others in thick plus lenses.  </p><p> </p><p>NJ I hope you will contact me.  </p><p> </p><p>nevilleblight@outlook.com </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Billy A.</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2017, 03:06</p><p>Yesterday i wore my -12 superlenti Ray Bans and one girl asked me why i wear glasses without corrective lenses...is that girl so silly or -12 superlenti looks like plans? It wasn't first comment like this.. Maybe, lenti looks "strange" and people think that are just fashionable lenses.. Too much weird looks at my glasses, its like they've never seen lenti before </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Groot</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2017, 09:43</p><p>Plus Tony </p><p> </p><p>I think my glasses do look pretty strong from the side. I just barely see myself like that. They also create a strong halo that gives them a coke bottle effect even when I pay for thin lenses. But in flattering lighting and from the front they look relatively mild. But other people probably see me from other angles. When my sister was at the DMV they asked her if her +1.00 glasses are just for reading. I never got the same question. When I took off my glasses to try the test without them they acted weird about it. I ended up failing because of astigmatism. I wonder if they can subconsciously tell my glasses are pretty strong or if it was just because they saw me wear them more. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus Tony</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2017, 08:25</p><p>I think it is very much in the eye of the beholder and depends on their knowledge of lenses and preconceptions. Someone with perfect vision who knows nothing might look at a -2 or +2 lens and think "wow that is strong". </p><p> </p><p>As for looking at lenses it depends so much on the size of the frame and the index of the lens that it is almost impossible to say. I have a friend with a prescription of +4.25 but her high index lenses look no thicker than my standard index +2.00 and her eyes are only a little more magnified. However if you look at her lenses from the side you can see that it is a relatively strong prescription.  </p><p> </p><p>There are also plenty of posts on instagram where the wearer tags their glasses as cokebottlelenses that don't look particularly strong to me. I also wonder if people who describe themselves on instagram as 'blind' or 'blindasf' who quite clearly aren't do so to justify to others their need or desire to wear a relatively mild prescription when frankly in my view no justification is needed because if you need glasses of any strength to see clearly and you are comfortable wearing them the only person you should have to justify it to is yourself!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Groot</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2017, 22:05</p><p>At what point does the average observer start describing glasses as thick, coke bottles or strong? In fanatasy stories it seems to be +4.00, but that hasn't been my experience in real life. I think for plus glasses it's +5.00. For minus I think it's even higher. I think minus glasses tend to look weaker. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2017, 09:32</p><p>Hi David, </p><p>I got my first contacts in my mid 20's.   I was a rep at the time and they made a huge difference to driving. They were also hard and very uncomfortable!   Everyone said I was always blinking and they were prone to popping out.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2017, 09:16</p><p>Hey Colin, </p><p> </p><p>So my dad's ex uk military so I moved around a lot, wasn't back in UK until 6-7 years old.  At that point, I got contacts for playing sport on the weekend at first and very quickly changed over to them for the school day and back to glasses at home. </p><p> </p><p>That's about as early as I can remember realising the big difference between glasses and contacts. </p><p> </p><p>The other memory was they hurt like hell for the first few weeks and were hard.  It was much easier when my RX dropped and soft contacts came around.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2017, 23:24</p><p>Hi David, </p><p>I meant to ask if you had any problems because of your glasses at school or if you got on with them ok.   </p><p>I don't think mine actually stopped me from doing anything but I wasn't very good at games anyway! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2017, 23:01</p><p>Hi David, </p><p>I also had my glasses from a very young age. I had cateracts removed at 6 weeks old and had glasses with elastic round the back of my head.  I don't know what prescription they were but I don't think it has changed very much over the years. I  was at school in the 60's and had round NHS kids glasses with the curl sides.   The ones I had in Secondary school had full frame lenses which were very thick. In those days they were glass and very heavy. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2017, 11:56</p><p>Hi David, </p><p>It's just the standard lens.  I've been told high index is not available in my prescription. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2017, 11:02</p><p>Hey Colin, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks! </p><p> </p><p>Looks like the bowls are quite a bit smaller than mine, what index are they?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2017, 10:31</p><p>Hey Owlish, </p><p> </p><p>I did have them from a very young age, the first RX I think I was given was around +16, very quickly jumping to almost 19, it stayed around there until I think 3-4 years old at which point it dropped year on year until it hit a low of around +12. </p><p> </p><p>In the last few years it's risen by around 0.25 to 0.5 per year, the glasses you're seeing are the ones I use for my computer and I prefer something a little stronger as it helps with eye strain. </p><p> </p><p>@Colin, i'd be interested to see a picture of your glasses to see how they compare to my older ones.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2017, 10:09</p><p>Hi.   </p><p>My prescription is plus 27ish and also find a huge difference between wearing glasses and contacts.  I am used to both and am sure the brain "switches" between glasses mode and contacts mode. I am also told that I move my head a lot even in contacts.    </p><p>I took my driving test in the UK in 1969 wearing glasses and drove for several years before getting contacts. My optician said I passed the driving sight test.  He did give me a prescription for driving so I could wear the glasses very close to my eyes. It felt as though my eyes almost touched the back of the lenses and my eyelashes brushed against them.   This gave me a wider field of vision.   I was conscious about my eyesight and drove carefully but I don't think I was a danger to myself or other road users at the time.    I wouldn't drive in specs now though! </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Owlish</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2017, 04:50</p><p>Great pics David, thanks for putting them up. It's clear to me that the lenticular lenses look better and must be much lighter and more comfortable to wear. My impression is that opticians are trained to believe that full-view is better but of course they want to sell expensive high index and aspheric lenses. </p><p> </p><p>Another question if you don't mind. I guess you had pretty strong glasses from an early age. Did your prescription remain roughly stable or have you had increases over the years?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2017, 12:29</p><p>Hey Cactus, </p><p> </p><p>I have one bit of info that people that have known me a long time have said.  Apparently I look around a lot from side to side and down when we're out, say going to get lunch. </p><p> </p><p>I know I need to do it when wearing glasses but I don't notice that I do it when I'm not wearing them, I guess just programming from when I was young as I wore glasses for most of that time. </p><p> </p><p>For peripheral vision, there's a huge difference, object size too.   </p><p> </p><p>So as an example, on my computer right here, sitting in the same seat, with glasses, a good 80-90% of my vision is the screen / keyboard, without, looking at what i'm typing here, i can see the edge of a chair that's to my right and the light switch to the left, if I had to guess, i'd say that's about 150 degree arc. </p><p> </p><p>Regarding sports, as I only play with contacts, when I tried some table tennis recently, I found I just couldn't hit anything, when normally i'm quite good.  We had a good laugh about it but ended up just keeping score.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2017, 10:29</p><p>David, </p><p>My engineering background leads me to believe that the brain is truly a biological computer.  Vision actually occurs in the brain. It appears that once the brain figures out how to process images with several different types of correction, it can "load" the appropriate algorithm for the situation very quickly.   </p><p>Your experience with switching between contacts and glasses, pretty much confirms it. I suspect the image size on the Retina is substantially different with the contact and with your glasses. </p><p>Do you notice much difference in your peripheral vision between your glasses and your contacts? </p><p>C.   </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2017, 09:35</p><p>Hey, </p><p> </p><p>Firstly, I don't have problems switching, I'm so used to it by now, though I do live differently with each, for example I never drive in glasses, don't do sport etc. but equally, I don't tend to read in the evenings in contacts. </p><p> </p><p>https://ibb.co/bPtkx5 </p><p>https://ibb.co/h2muqQ </p><p>https://ibb.co/gRMuqQ </p><p>https://ibb.co/mxBuqQ </p><p>https://ibb.co/cq7pPk </p><p> </p><p>There's the other images</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Owlish</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2017, 05:16</p><p>David it's perfectly understandable that you don't want to put your face out there to be misused on the internet. I wouldn't either.  </p><p>No I just thought some pics of the glasses from the front would be interesting. </p><p> </p><p>Also, do you encounter any difficulty in switching from contacts to glasses or are you completely used to the change in optical effects?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2017, 23:06</p><p>Hi, </p><p> </p><p>I was born fairly early and from parents both with strong plus prescription though neither as high as mine. </p><p> </p><p>My eyes are just too small, no other issues which makes my prescription entirely sphere and very easy to wear / find contacts. </p><p> </p><p>What more pictures do you want? (I won't be putting up any that show me wearing them as a previous one was used to create fake profiles and post some quite disturbing comments)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Owlish</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2017, 16:28</p><p>Hi David, your prescription is an interesting one; just into the level at which lentis are appropriate. Are you extremely hyperopic or have you had surgery to remove cataracts? </p><p> </p><p>More pics would be appreciated.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2017, 10:34</p><p>Hey, </p><p> </p><p>My eyes look noticeably larger than with the lenticular pair.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2017, 08:23</p><p>David, </p><p>Both glasses look good to me. How do your eyes look in the full frame pair?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2017, 08:13</p><p>Hey guys, </p><p> </p><p>So I ordered some new glasses, so when I placed the order I asked for the usual, low index, lenticulars as this keeps the weight down, I only use them for when I can't wear my contacts and I really dislike the high index aberrations at night (I often have to do long hours at work) </p><p> </p><p>It seems however that the message for lenticular wasn't passed onto the lab so they just made them as low index glasses, full field.  </p><p> </p><p>This is a bit crazy for a +14.5 prescription! </p><p> </p><p>Needless to say, when they turned up, I let them know that's not what I ordered and they immediately apologised and remade them, allowing me to keep the others in the mean time and as a back up pair.  My old ones were about to fall apart so they knew how badly I needed them. </p><p> </p><p>I figured you guys would all be interested to see the difference in thickness between the 2.  This is the same frame, same prescription, same index of lens: </p><p> </p><p>https://ibb.co/g5QnaQ </p><p>https://ibb.co/f4OC9k </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;31 May 2017, 20:37</p><p>Peter, </p><p>Maybe your wife put two and two together about the effects of GOC and wound up with 5.  You are truly fortunate and blessed. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;31 May 2017, 18:12</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p>Two sets of twin girls. Eldest are five and a half the second set two years younger. Number five is a single girl. Looking after a young family is fulltime work. My wife has given up her job to be at home.  </p><p>I am able to fit in GOC with work and family. Sundays I GOC with +13 glasses and soft contacts after Saturday night with no lenses in bed so as to rest my eyes. Once the kids are all in bed I change to the RGPs and +22 glasses. The RGPs I keep in until Wednesday afternoon which is free. Back with the weak GOC I am able to play normally with the girls. They see me in both glasses.  </p><p>Then the cycle restarts Wednesday evening once they are asleep. I keep in the RGPs until after work Saturday lunchtime. I don't drive in the +22 glasses but feel confident to do so in the other pair. </p><p>My boss and work colleagues know me only in +22 glasses. There have been no comments or questions so I assume, as you say, they think I have had cataracts. My job involves  a few face to face interviews in my office, also quite a lot of telephone work. Computer work is on a laptop as I find it comfortable to read the screen with the glasses slightly pulled down. I am not sure why this works but I can read print with slightly more sliding down. </p><p>Viagra has nothing on GOC! I am lucky my wife has encouraged me so much. I cannot imagine doing this in secret. </p><p>You have been instrumental in getting me to this point. Like many other people I am very grateful for your help and encouragement.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;31 May 2017, 17:01</p><p>Peter, </p><p>I am not the least surprised that #5 is on the way, congratulations. Apparently,  GOC is better than Viagra.  Just wait until they are all in their teens.  May I ask their ages? </p><p>I understand they are "Cheaper by the Dozen". </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;31 May 2017, 14:38</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p>Like you mentioned I also wear a baseball cap. Recently we have had a lot of very bright sunshine and I find that difficult.  </p><p>I am an insurance underwriter.  </p><p>4 now, 5 in September!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 May 2017, 20:58</p><p>Peter, </p><p>Another suggestion.  One of our members, who was born without some lenses in his eyes and also had some other issues, had to wear glasses in the +40 range.  He found that wearing a base ball type cap helped some.   </p><p>Apparently, the bill on the cap minimized light entering his glasses and eyes from above.  He never commented on why, but it might be worth considering if ambient light from overhead is causing you any problems. </p><p>I suspect your boss and customers believe that you have had Cataract surgery and they were not able to use an IOL. </p><p>May I ask you occupation? </p><p>Still 4 and holding? </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;30 May 2017, 17:37</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p>When I first dreamed about wearing high plus glasses I thought the peripheral vision loss was at the side. It is of course a 360 loss. For me the main problem is not looking down enough so missing steps and curbs. It is not unusual for me to walk into low objects. </p><p>I went to an optician and got an RGP prescription for my true myopia of -3. It was very easy to add the extra 0 to get my desired cls. No one has challenged it when I order. </p><p>It would be untrue if I said +22 glasses present no problems, they are not easy. But with continued use I have adapted, by moving to a new town and workplace allowed me to wear them everyday. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 May 2017, 16:03</p><p>Peter, </p><p>Thanks for the update.  Is the loss of peripheral vision with the high plus glasses giving you much problem? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;30 May 2017, 13:25</p><p>It's taken me six months and too many £'s to count but I have achieved my aim.  </p><p>Eventually I found a supplier of -30 RGP contacts and with patience I am able to wear them for extended periods. I had to tweak my GOC glasses power but now can see well with +22 glasses. My family have moved and so I took full advantage and wear the combination most of the time. It's a struggle at times. My new boss knows me with thick glasses. My wife has made it possible, she knows how I need to do this. My young children have just accepted me as I am now. </p><p>Without encouragement from members of this forum I don't think I could have done this. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2016, 13:33</p><p>Cactus, </p><p>Any idea which type of RGP go up to -28 or even -30? </p><p> </p><p>Number 5 is a possibility, the GOC glasses seem to make everything bigger. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2016, 11:38</p><p>Peter, </p><p>To wear +20 glasses, you would probably need CLs of about -28, but the actual prescription is very touchy in the Vertex Distance department.  About 0.4 diopters per mm. </p><p>Better be careful or you may have 5.  That could be a hidden cost associated indulging your fetish.  Enjoy, but be careful. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2016, 11:28</p><p>Peter, </p><p>The most important thing about wearing CLs of any type is Oxygen and Tear delivery to the Cornea.  The Cornea is living tissue, but it DOES NOT have a blood supply.  That means that it must get its Oxygen from the air and Oxygen, nutrients, and lubrication from tears. </p><p>Modern, high moisture, soft CLs have a lot of benefits from both an ability to pass Oxygen and tears to the Cornea and from a comfort point to view, but there are limitations.  RGP hard CLs solved one of the big problems with older hard CLs, nonexistent Oxygen transmission.  Older CLs used several techniques for maintaining tear delivery.  One was to have some slight indents in the surface that contacted the Cornea that allowed much better tear delivery to the cornea.  The indentations filled with tears so there was no apparent distortion.  Hard contacts also have the advantage of slightly reshaping the Cornea to temporarily eliminate Astigmatism.   </p><p>Many hard CL wearers experience Spectacle Blur when they take out their hard contacts and put on their glasses.  This is caused by the Cylinder correction in the glasses not matching the actual (corrected) Astigmatism at the moment.  As the Corneas gradually resumed their natural shape, the Blur went away because the Astigmatism and the Cylinder correction were matched. </p><p>Contact lenses also need to be able to move around on the Cornea as you blink.  This help keep the tear film under the contact lens, refreshed.  Sometimes, in moving around, CLs rotate.  That is one of the reasons Toric CLs are very hard to get right.  If the lens rotates out of it correct alignment, the Axis of the Cylinder correction is wrong, and often it is worse than not correcting the Astigmatism at all. </p><p>I need some Cylinder correction. Many years ago, I tried Hard contacts, but could not wear them comfortably because my eyelids are tight and I never could get used to the edge effect of the CLs.  Later, I tried RGPs with much improved edge design, but I really preferred soft CLs.  I tried Toric CLs when they became commonly available, but was never able to get them too be stable enough for daily wear, probably because of my tight eyelids.  All that is why I like the idea of GOC with Sphere Only CLs and the Cylinder correction in the glasses. </p><p>That is a lot of explanation to try to make this point.  Soft CLs are very forgiving, Hard CLs are not.  It is VERY important that RGPs be professionally fitted to make sure that the Cornea gets adequate Oxygen, nutrients and moisture.  Also, if you have Astigmatism that the RGPs will correct, your glasses prescription needs to reflect that.   </p><p>Very high prescription GOC with RGPs should be done with the assistance of an understanding ECP. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2016, 14:32</p><p>Cactus you were spot on about what the GOC would be like. Thankfully I was sitting down in the hotel room soon after I arrived. I took out my normal contacts and put in the GOC ones. As soon as I put on the glasses I knew what you meant. I saw reasonably clearly, more so than hoped. As I moved my head the room , enlarged room, rushed before my eyes. I felt quite sick. As you suggested I had taken stugeron, travel sick pills and when they kicked in all improved. When I felt better I stood up and walked around the room. Distances were all wrong, everything looked so close. I grabbed the bathroom door handle but missed it. Once in the bathroom a glance in the mirror gave a fantastic rush, I am an OO. I felt apprehensive about going through the doorway, the doorframe was not straight. </p><p>Determined to get used to the new vision I walked around the room for a bit then ventured to the reception. Wow what a crazy walk. I had brought a walking pole as you said and that steadied me. </p><p>The hotel is next to the river and I usually walk by the water each visit. It took a long time this time but I managed, even the footbridge over a stream. </p><p>Dinner was clumsy. Not knowing distances I knocked over a glass of wine. I needed to slip the glasses down my nose to read the menu. </p><p>I met a new customer for lunch on Saturday. Wearing the GOC glasses was fun, and at times exciting. Basically I have been excited all weekend. </p><p>Now home and desperately thinking of how I can tell my wife, I need to GOC regularly. </p><p>Mark, you have been experiencing a fantastic feeling for 4 years ahead of me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Arthur</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2016, 11:22</p><p>Reading Stan's story is not dis-similar to my own. Nanophthalmos is common but in my case cataracts were congenital. For me surgery was at six weeks and thick aphakia glasses from a few months.  </p><p>I know no different so my vision is normal as far as I know. I need stronger glasses than Stan and have developed coping skills over the years.  </p><p>I found the possible reasons for being so crosseyed interesting. As is not uncommon I  need severe BO prism correction which continues to change over the years. I have a combination of prisms, ground and Fresnel, it was when I started with the stick on prisms difficulties started.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2016, 20:24</p><p>Stan, </p><p>They will look exactly the same becase the lens maker used the same conversion procedure I did, to make the glasses you have.  As I mentioned, the conversion procedure I used can be used for conversion in either direction., from + cylinder to - cylinder or - cylinder to + cylinder.  If we start with the - cylinder prescription of: </p><p>OD +28.25, -6.75 x 175 18 BO </p><p>OS + 28.00, -5.50 x 155 18 BO </p><p>and algebraically add the cylinder to the sphere +28.25 -6.75 = +21.50 </p><p>Then change the sign on the cylinder from - to +6.75 </p><p>then 175 -90 = 85 </p><p>we are back to your prescription for your Right Eye for distance </p><p>OD +21.50, +6.75 x 85  18 BO </p><p>The prescription for your Left Eye (OS) is done the dame way. </p><p>I am trying to think of a way you could inexpensively experiment with slightly more + in your glasses without ordering, new expensive glasses.  Three ideas come to mind. </p><p>1. Vertex Distance effects are VERY significant with your prescription.  Approximately 0.80 diopters per mm in Sphere.  You might move your glasses very slightly away from your eyes.  That has the effect of increasing the effective Plus power of your glasses </p><p>2. You might be able to get some +1.00 Press-on lenses.  They are similar to Press-on Fresnel Prisms, but they do not introduce distortion like Fresnel Prisms do.  If the back surface of your lenses are flat or almost so, they could be applied to the back surface.  They are not very expensive and come off easily if they don't help. </p><p>3. A supplemental +1.00 lens.  They are available a Clip-on magnifying glasses or over-the-counter reading glasses.  The problem is that because of the shape of your glasses lenses, I don't thing you could wear them over your glasses. </p><p>At this point, I don't think the additional small amount of + in your glasses would have much effect on your need to BO prism.  However, it might make your distance vision more comfortable. </p><p>I hope this is understandable and helpful. </p><p>Cactus  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2016, 20:57</p><p>Stan, </p><p>I am working on a detailed response.  Please bear with me. </p><p>The short version is: </p><p>The conversion I did is the prescription you provided, converted to - Cylinder notation for easier understanding by me and other members who are used to prescriptions with - Cylinder.  I also provided both Distance and Reading prescriptions for additional clarity because you prefer reading glasses rather than bifocals. </p><p>Let me clarify how Cylinder Axis angles are measured.  By convention, 0 degrees is Horizontal and 90 degrees is Vertical.  The degrees are numbered as if you are looking at the patient.  The numbers start at 0 (horizontal) and increase in a Counter-Clockwise direction through 90 degrees and on around to 179.  0 and 180 degrees are the same Axis so it is not necessary for the Axis numbers to exceed 180.  The Long Axis of your Astigmatism is very close to Horizontal.  More about Astigmatism, Cylinder and Axis, in my detailed response. </p><p>The test you did with the book that yielded approximately 40 cm indicates that the +3.00 Add for reading is having the approximate effect of a +2.50 Add.  That means that you could probably use an additional +0.50 in your distance glasses. The actual reading glasses Add depends strictly on your preferred reading distance.  With no accommodation ability, you can easily change your reading distance to focus, but you have no way to compensate for distance.  You may be slightly under corrected for distance as I mentioned in my previous post. </p><p>I urge you to reject any offer of Press-on prisms, unless they are for testing purposes only.  Press-on Fresnel lenses introduce significant distortion that cannot be corrected.  I have been dealing with double vision and prism issues for about 30 years.  High prism glasses are hard to make, fit, and get the correction right.  I tried 20/20 BO with Fresnels and the distortion was so high, I could not read with them.  Fresnel Lenses were developed for use as relatively compact Beam Formers in nautical Lighthouses.  They work very well there. </p><p>I have very high Fatigue Esophoria. More about that later, if you are interested. </p><p>I had successful Cataract surgery with IOS in 2001.  I am thankful every day that it was successful.  I have a friend, about your age, who was born without Crystalline Lenses.  He needs glasses that are even stronger than yours by about +10 diopters.   </p><p>I have some understanding of your situation.  The prism issues personally and the extreme Hyperopia issues based on his experiences. </p><p>C. </p><p>  </p><p>.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2016, 19:05</p><p>Peter, </p><p>Be very careful.  Sit for a while after you try the combination and look around.  Do not be surprised if you experience some of the worst symptoms of Motion Sickness.  The difference between the high apparent rate of motion you see, as you move your head and what your semi-circular canals, sense, can cause nausea.  Have a trash can handy, just in case or consider some motion sickness pills. </p><p>When you decide to move around, be extra careful of stairs, curbs and objects in front of you, particularly on the floor.  Reduction or loss of peripheral vision occurs in all directions, including down.  </p><p>Until you get used to wearing the high Plus glasses, consider a cane or something similar to sweep the area in front of you.  A fall could be disastrous if you are alone. </p><p>Good luck and please tell us what you experience. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stan</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2016, 11:23</p><p>Cactus that is a really big increase in the power of my lenses. Will I be able to see with them? </p><p>I quickly tried the reading test and as a rough estimate 40cm. </p><p>Yes I had three weeks lying still in quite a dark room, they did the second eye a few days after the first so to minimise the time lying down. I was wheeled to the eye testing room in darkened glasses and couldn't see anything. My first glasses were temporary hospital issue as my Rx needed to settle. I cried when I saw myself in the mirror for the first time and found life very hard. I couldn't get used to the new vision and felt very sick and disorientated. The hospital gave me rehab sessions so I got a bit better , up to now everyday is a learning experience. it is the norm for me to trip up things and walk into objects. I tend to go to places I know or have visited before.  </p><p>I don't have prisms which stick on, my lenses are ground and obviously odd in shape. </p><p>Thank you for your help and advice.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2016, 09:15</p><p>Stan, </p><p>Thank you for the information.  I have obverted your prescription to - Cylinder format to help understand it better. </p><p>OD +28.25, -6.75 x 175  18 BO   </p><p>OS + 28,00, -5.50 x 155 18 BO  </p><p>Reading Glasses would be </p><p>OD +31.25, -6.75 x 175  18 BO   </p><p>OS + 31,00, -5.50 x 155 18 BO </p><p>I don't know if you are familiar with the conversion between + Cylinder and - Cylinder, but lens makers do it if they receive a + Cylinder prescription.  Algebraically add the Cylinder to the Sphere.  Change the sign on the Cylinder, and add or subtract 90 degrees to the Axis so that the Axis number is between 0 and 180 degrees.  The two prescriptions are optically identical. </p><p>It really must have been a shock to wake up from cataract surgery and discover that our vision was worse than before.  It does happen occasionally that the Crystalline Lens capsule must be completely removed, as was necessary before the development of IOLs.  The Crystalline Lens capsule provides a barrier between the watery Aqueous Humor and the gel like Vitreous Humor and its removal allows the two to mix.  Sometimes the Retina becomes inflamed an complete loss of vision occurs.  You have to keep your head still for several weeks to minimize the risk of further complications. </p><p>I suspect that most Ophthalmic Surgeons would be very reluctant to consider any type of IOL or ICL elective refractive surgery because of the risks. </p><p>Your high Cylinder also complicates using Toric Contact Lenses. </p><p>I think that your mention that your reading glasses are relaxing to wear.  It is normal for distant things to be blurry with them because that is the way reading glasses work.  With your reading glasses, you are actually slightly myopic.  The question is how much.  It is very easy to find out how much and that would give you a clue about how much more + might be helpful in both your distance and reading glasses. </p><p>With your reading glasses, hold a book closer than normal and then move it away until the text just becomes clear.  Measure the distance.  If it is more than 33 cm or 13 inches, it is likely that you could use a little more +.  If you will tell me the distance, I can calculate the approximate additional + you need. </p><p>Need to think a bit about your prism situation.  Sometimes, prism correction is done with "Press-on" Fresnel prisms.  They leave a lot to be desired as far as Visual Acuity is concerned in adults.  They typically introduce uncorrectable distortion.  Do you have Fresnel prisms in your glasses? </p><p>Also, because you live in the London area, I suspect you are familiar the Moorfields Hospital.  They are considered to be one of the best Eye Hospitals in the World.  </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stan</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2016, 06:53</p><p>Cactus and Mark </p><p> </p><p>I live in south London and work in the city of London at an insurance office.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2016, 20:42</p><p>Stan, </p><p>A bit more Plus might be helpful for both distance and close, to minimizing convergence tendencies.  Probably not much more Plus than maybe +1 or +2 diopters.  I don't think there is any way to predict what might be helpful, without actually trying some things.  The idea is to try to keep the Ciliary Muscles from trying to squeeze your nonexistent Crystalline Lenses, to focus close.   </p><p>The interconnection I mentioned previously, is actually two way.  When your eyes converge to look at something close, that also triggers the focus response. I suspect that your eyes try to converge when you are not wearing your glasses.  Your brain may detect a really blurry image and try to correct for it.  Of course, that is impossible, but the "try" causes your eyes to turn inward.  If you do that enough, your EPCS gets reprogramed to just keep your eyes crossed. </p><p>BTW, I am NOT an Eye Care Professional.  My background is Electronic and Computer Engineering.  I tend to approach problems as engineering problems rather than medical problems.  To talk engineer talk for a moment.  The EPCS appear to me to be what is called an Open Loop Servo System.  Servo systems are used for positioning things.  There are two major types.  In addition to the Open Loop system there are also Closed Loop Servo Systems.  The difference is that in the Closed Loop System, the computer knows EXACTLY where something is to a tiny fraction of an inch or mm.  Computer Controlled mills and lathes are Closed Loop systems.  Open Loop Systems are not as accurate, but use a comparison between desired events and observed results.  The EPCS uses the Images from your two eyes to control your eyes and get the images close enough to fuse in your brain.  The "servo motors" are 3 muscle PAIRS on each eye that work in opposition, against each other. </p><p>It appears that the EPCS uses Vertical edges for horizontal fusion and Horizontal edges for vertical fusion.  If the images are not clear, the EPCS has trouble getting the eyes in the proper position.  You may have noticed that it is pretty common for the eyes of people without sight, to wander as the EPCS tries to fuse nonexistent images. </p><p>I also have double vision problems.  I need Base Out prism to help me fuse images.  I have been dealing with it for about 30 years. My eyes tend to cross when I am tired.  I have been diagnosed with Fatigue Esophoria and have had muscle surgery to try to fix it.  (BTW, It didn't work very well). When the prism got above 7 in each eye, I started having Visual Acuity problems with my glasses.  I didn't get satisfactory answers from my ECPs and stated researching and learning as much as possible about vision and optics. </p><p>I would like to ask more questions about your experiences, but I understand if you feel uncomfortable discussing any of this, publicly.  If you would prefer, please feel free to contact me privately at cactusjack1928@hotmail.com. </p><p>The immediate questions are: </p><p>1. What is your complete glasses prescription? </p><p>2.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2016, 13:23</p><p>Stan, </p><p>It is possible that your Focus Control System (FCS) is trying to use your Ciliary Muscles to squeeze your nonexistent Crystalline Lenses, to add some Plus.  There is an interconnection, in your brain, between your FCS and your Eye Position Control System (EPCS) that causes your eyes to converge when you focus on something close. </p><p>It is possible that you might actually need a bit more Plus in your glasses to minimize the attempted focusing effort. </p><p>It appears that the EPCS is programable to some extent.  You might be able to do some therapy to minimize the tendency to cross with a little more Plus in your glasses.  Prism correction can reduce your Visual Acuity (VA) because the Central Axis of Vision (CAV) does not impinge on the back surface of your glasses at 90 degrees and it may be difficult to have the CAV and the Optical Center of your lenses co-incident.  With very high power lenses, the closer those things are together the better the VA.  </p><p>May I ask how much Prism you need? </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2016, 13:08</p><p>Peter, </p><p>+13.00 glasses with a VD of 12 mm have an effective power of very close to +15 at the Cornea.  VD effects are about 0.17 diopters per mm. </p><p>If your actual prescription is about -3.00, I would suggest -18 CLs. </p><p>You haven't mentioned your age but if you can tolerate it, I would suggest considering -18.50 CLs and  let your Ciliary Muscles make up the difference. </p><p>To some extent GOC is an art rather than a science and you may have to try different powers to get it just right.  One thing i typically suggest is using one power of CL in both eyes and adjusting the glasses prescription as necessary.  Also, any Cylinder and Axis needs to be in the glasses exactly as prescribed, unless the Cylinder is more than +/- 4.00.  I suggest not using Toric CLs for GOC. </p><p>Unfortunately, CLs above +/- 8.00 are only available in 0.50 increments. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stan</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2016, 12:37</p><p>My present glasses do not lend themselves to walking fast, just the opposite. You are lucky Mark that you can do that. I only pick up any speed when out with friends and they keep an eye out for me.  </p><p>Before the surgery I wore plus 8 and 8.5, now I need plus 21.5 and 22.5 with an extra 3 for reading. The new glasses took me a long time to adjust and I became depressed for several months. I used to play football but not anymore.  At the weekend I may go out with a few mates and they play a bit of footie with me, I know they are being extra careful to pass me the ball and call out to warn me. </p><p> There seems no reason why my eyes have begun to cross so much, initially they were reluctant to prescribe prisms but now there is no choice.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2016, 11:17</p><p>Cactus and Mark, </p><p>Thank you for your help. </p><p>I ordered plus 13 lenses in the glasses as the price jumped up after then. I should have ordered weaker contacts by the sound of it. I can get next day delivery if I order tonight or tomorrow they will be delivered before I leave on Friday. What would be a suitable contact to order,-18 or -19? </p><p>Mark I am staying in a hotel I have used many times so know my way about. I am very excited and will be so disappointed if the glasses have not arrived.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2016, 10:33</p><p>@Peter, </p><p> </p><p>As CJ said, the contacts / glasses seem off but we'll see. </p><p> </p><p>As for doing it, find somewhere quiet and familiar, don't try and do anything where you could potentially hurt yourself, (driving, cooking) and be careful in others like going up and down stairs. </p><p> </p><p>Everything will look very different, take time to get used to it, I wouldn't be surprised if you said you felt a little nausea the first time. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2016, 08:02</p><p>Peter, </p><p>I think the GOC combo of your prescription, -20 contacts and +13 glasses is off by about 1.50 diopters, but as they say, "Proof of the pudding etc" </p><p>My calculations came up with needing about +14.50 in the glasses to neutralize about -17 at the Cornea.  If that is correct, you will need some more Plus from somewhere.  Depending on your age, you amy be able to supply the additional Plus, internally.  A temporary alternative may be some OTC reading glasses in the +1.50 range, over the +13s for distance and maybe as much as +3.50 for reading. </p><p>High prescription GOC is a very inexact "science".  The culprit is accurate Vertex Distance effects in high + or - glasses.  Because the VD effects are the Square of the glasses prescription, a 1 or 2 mm error in the VD means that the combo will be hard to wear. </p><p>Please let me know how the combo works or how close I am on my estimates.  Really, estimates is all they are.  In doing GOC, it is better have a little too much Minus at the Cornea or not quite enough Plus in the glasses, IF you have enough Accommodation Range to compensate, comfortably. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2016, 06:33</p><p>Hopefully this weekend I can start GOC. I am naturally shortsighted with a weak Rx of -3.25/3.00 which I usually correct with contacts. I have ordered and have now got some -20 contacts and I am waiting for some glasses to arrive from Hong Kong which they tell me are on their way. I have ordered plus 13 glasses and I am desperate for them to arrive. This weekend I am away on business and if the glasses arrive I will try GOC. </p><p>Any tips for my first try. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2016, 16:35</p><p>Hey, </p><p> </p><p>Well, firstly, when wearing the new ones, I actually have very good vision just restricted in area, they're only +13s compared to +17 and higher which becomes a lot more noticeable.  They are also low index which means there's almost 0 aberrations at the edge of the bowl area meaning I have good vision there too. </p><p> </p><p>I also walk very quickly, so instead of having to take care of those around me, I tend to be able to cut through it all without that many issues.  Stan how strong are yours? </p><p> </p><p>In regards to my wife, I just told her what I wanted to do, just had a long talk about it, there's no other way to approach it really. </p><p> </p><p>Why do I want to wear them? I feel like I should need them, it's a strange thing to explain and feel complete when wearing them. </p><p> </p><p>I'm not full time no, how much I wear them varies wildly, last week, it was 5 days out of 7 but the week before that was 0.  How tired I am does matter as the contacts dry out very quickly when I'm tired and the constant blinking and adjustment gets very annoying. </p><p> </p><p>I used to have reading glasses for when I had  +10s, didn't like the frame and very rarely wore them.  I'm thinking about doing it again, last time I did it, adding +2 to my prescription worked out about right.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stan</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2016, 11:23</p><p>I just got home from work and as usual checked here amongst others. The journey home on the Tube is never easy for me. So I am amazed others wish to share this experience. Mark and Peter I would be interested why you would like to wear these glasses. I have a set route through the stations and try never to change . The crowds don't seem to get any easier to cope with and this is five years after the surgery. I leave work at four so as to avoid the worst of the crush and then I can get home before it is too dark.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2016, 10:10</p><p>Mark, </p><p>How I explain to my wife is still a problem. I do not want to be a closet GOC wearer but cannot think of a suitable excuse. Any suggestions? </p><p>Now do you wear the lenticular glasses in public, you mentioned a move, are you now fulltime? </p><p>Do you have separate reading glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2016, 09:45</p><p>Hi Peter </p><p>To Mark, </p><p> </p><p>When I started, it felt good, like I was completing myself but there was a nagging feeling that it wasn't right and I just ignored it at first. </p><p> </p><p>My vision was good, 20/30 at worst and I could do anything I could do normally, however, I was very clumsy, even beyond the first day or 2 getting used to them.  I'd misstep on curbs, clip doorways, eating was.. interesting as hand eye coordination wasn't easy either.  Anything where I didn't have to move like gaming or watching TV was no problem. </p><p> </p><p>When I first got them, i'd wear them all day at weekends and sometimes in the evenings and the only person who really saw it was my wife. </p><p> </p><p>My wife doesn't really like it but tolerated it but would immediately point out when I made mistakes and blame it on the "stupid glasses" (even though everyone occasionally just doesn't see something) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2016, 08:27</p><p>To Mark, </p><p>Your comments were very interesting. You are 4 years ahead of me. </p><p>When you started with the very strong 16/17 what did it feel like? What was your vision like? Did you wear them all day to start with? What did your wife and other people say to you? </p><p>I have so many questions. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2016, 19:09</p><p>I was a little concernend about it myself and im usually able to spot them easily. </p><p> </p><p>I however have dark brown eyes  and the edge of the lens lines up nicely with the edge of the pupil making it virtually invisible </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Owlish</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2016, 16:14</p><p>Question for Mark: aren't your contact lenses visible to others magnified as they must be through your glasses? I understand that most people wouldn't notice them but some might, especially those who have contacts themselves, I think. Has anyone ever asked you about this? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2016, 10:42</p><p>I've been wearing high powered + glasses with GOC on and off for about 4 years now. </p><p> </p><p>I'm going to recount a lot of things that I have found along the way, both good and bad. </p><p> </p><p>To start at the end before going back, I am currently wearing +13.5s with lenticular lenses. </p><p> </p><p>When I wanted to first do this, I decided to jump right in, I ordered the strongest contacts I could find after getting measured for contacts with a fake prescription and then ordered the corresponding glasses, something like +16/17 small bowl lenticulars if I remember correctly. </p><p> </p><p>I kind of regret that now as I wasn't really ready for the change, I wore them as much as I could and it did make me very happy however the change was a lot.  I couldn't drive in them, I would walk into things, burn myself when cooking etc. I almost quit completely with that. </p><p> </p><p>I decided to bring it right back, so I got some new contacts and got some +8 glasses and tried again. This was much easier, the full field lenses helped as well as losing a lot less peripheral vision meant I could do things like normal but it still took me a couple of weeks to get used to it properly. </p><p> </p><p>The full field lenses however didn't really do it for me so I upped the contacts and the glasses to +10.5 and found a place that could do lenticulars.  These were amazing, it felt right and I wore them on and off whenever I could but I knew my limitations far better.  I have made a rule to myself (and to make my wife feel a bit better about it all, she still doesn't really get it) that i'll never drive or do anything where having limited vision would be risky and I would VERY STRONGLY recommend the same for anyone who wants to try this. </p><p> </p><p>I wore those glasses for almost 2 years before I only recently moved up to these +13s.  I did this because I wanted a little stronger but also because I was starting a new job abroad and none of my new coworkers would have know they weren't real.  I am walking distance from my new job so am able to wear them all day long. </p><p> </p><p>This was a very hard step to do but I really enjoy it. </p><p> </p><p>Some general points </p><p> </p><p>Start low and work up the power over a number of months, test your limits but never put yourself in danger, the blind spots are much bigger than you think </p><p> </p><p>The glasses are VERY obvious, even with +10s so imagine if you really needed them and hated them and spend time and money getting the right frame, don't just order one off the internet.  It helps your confidence as well as vision quality. (less non stop adjusting) </p><p> </p><p>Aspheric lenses are amazing compared to non-aspherics, since trying them, im never going back. </p><p> </p><p>Find an optician who is willing to work with you.  I used the "I need them for an acting part" to get a first appointment before eventually telling the optician.  She's understanding and a little curious but doesn't really get it. </p><p> </p><p>Take very good care of your contacts, if you're away from the house and they start messing you around, you don't really want to have to take them out, this point is massively increased if you're with people you know but don't really know what you do in public. </p><p> </p><p>I hope these points help, if you have any more questions, I'll be happy to answer them when I'm next on here.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stan</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2016, 07:11</p><p>Peter, </p><p>Cactus and NJ are describing what it is like to wear aphakia glasses.  </p><p>After several years of slowly clouding lenses the surgeon decided to remove them. The planned implants did not go ahead due to damage to both lens sacs. It took several weeks to recover and my prescription increased by plus 13. As I had always worn glasses due to what my mother called small eyes my final prescription jumped to early plus 20s. As NJ described these are not easy to wear. I was at college at the time and took several months off studying to get used to my new vision. The main problem was and still is being in crowded places. When there is movement around me I get disorientated very easily, the glasses exaggerate any movement and people seem to jump into view as I am about to bump into them. </p><p>As hard as I try I seem to have a stare with what friends call my ping pong ball eyes, they look massive. I am now needing a lot more prisms in my lenses and my eyes are very crossed, more so since surgery. More surgery could help the turning in but I do not want that. </p><p>I am unsure whether GOC gives the same problems with strong lenses, it is certainly a challenge wearing such glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2016, 16:46</p><p>Thanks NJ and Cactus for your detailed replies. </p><p>I am very keen to experience the full effect of wearing very strong plus glasses. Will I get the full effect from GOC? What does it feel like to walk on a crowded pavement or into a busy shop? </p><p>NJ I am unsure if you GOC or not. What strength plus glasses do you wear?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2016, 14:37</p><p>Peter, CJ covered some of the technical and medical aspects of high hyperopia. The reality for the wearer of high plus glasses varies by person.  </p><p> </p><p>CJ is right that the loss of peripheral vision is the most significant impairment, and one that can't fully be compensated for. You'll notice two things about high plus people, that they move their heads a lot, and that they constantly adjust their glasses. The first is to compensate for the loss of peripheral vision, the second is to fine tune the focus. Myopes will do this too, sometimes. </p><p> </p><p>In general, a -20 myope, absent other visual problems, functions pretty much as a normally sighted person does. A +20 hyperope does not. Head turning is effective only when objects don't move. Walk into a busy store and life gets difficult really quickly. Forget about driving in city traffic. </p><p> </p><p>Most of the other issues with high plus glasses, like magnification and distortion of straight lines, are only problems initially. After a day or two, they're non-issues.  </p><p> </p><p>What's interesting is the huge person-to-person variation in how handicapped people feel. I've known a couple of high hyperopes who never complain or feel limited, and some with very modest scripts who constantly talk about how blind they are. The experience is personal. </p><p> </p><p>Regarding some of the stories you read here, just keep in mind that this is a fetish/fantasy sight and not all is as it seems. Someone who has a clear lens extraction and ends up with a +26 script would have already been wearing at least +15 glasses before the surgery, otherwise it's just not optically possible. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2016, 11:17</p><p>Peter, </p><p>As you may have noticed, this thread is not a good place to look.  I suggest trying the Hyperopia, Vision, and Refractive Surgery threads. </p><p>In the past, before IOLs became available, the most common reason for wearing very strong PLUS glasses was after Cataract Surgery.  Other reasons for needing strong Plus glasses are Hyperopia where the eyes did not grow or develop properly. Often as a result of the mother contracting a virus during pregnancy.  Rubella or as is often called 3 day or German Measles in the US, is infamous for causing vision problems in newborns. </p><p>It is fairly common for Hyperopia and a tendency for the eyes to turn inward, converge, or cross (Esophoria or Esotropia) to go together.  The reason for this is that there is a connection in the brain between the Focus Control System (FCS) and the Eye Position Control System (EPCS) where close focusing effort causes the eyes to converge.   </p><p>Normally, this connection is advantageous because it prevents double vision when focusing close to read.  However, low to moderate Hyperopia is the ONLY refractive error that a human can correct internally by using their Ciliary Musces and Crystalline lenses (their Auto-Focus System) to compensate.  The interconnection mentioned above causes their eyes to converge or cross resulting in double vision.  Vision actually occurs in the brain and if the brain cannot cause the images to fuse by adjusting the eye position, it will ignore one of the images.  If this condition (Amblyopia)  is not corrected at an early age, the brain will permanently ignore the image from one eye and we have no way to restore vision from that eye, even if the optical problem is corrected. </p><p>Very high PLUS glasses act like telephoto camera lenses or telescopes.  The visual field is very narrow and they have little peripheral vision.  One member described his vision with his glasses as being able to see the person sitting across from him on a train, but not being able to see the person sitting next to him. </p><p>Peripheral vision is very important for many common activities such as driving a car, walking down stairs, or even stepping off curbs.  That is why most people who need very strong PLUS correction opt for Contact Lenses if possible or are very careful where they step.  One member, who had elective Clear Lens removal without IOLs (effectively the older type of Cataract Surgery) had considerable difficulty adapting to his +26 glasses.  In one instance, he fell down a short stairway and fell when he missed curbs or obstacles in his path. </p><p>The best way to find out what it is like to need very high plus glasses is to consider doing some GOC.  As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words and the experience is probably worth a million.  If you are interested, we can tell you how. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

Me too have those two eyes tha insist turning inward. I have one that doesn't go upward but instead going down. Nystagmus doesn't bother If I manage to keep them calm. That is,  my nystagmus is the latent  one, so it shows up if I have any of my eye closed or occluded or if I am without my glasses for a prolonged time like this week. They needed some tests and trials and whatever so by Tuesday morning I think I was ready for those as I'd completed 18 hours bare eyes, then it took a whole day for me to feel a little better after getting my glasses back. I hate nystagmus the most. </p><p> </p><p>Mr. Phillip, I'm sorry I've learn from what you said and I thank God I don't have eyes pressure, that means, glaucoma. The eyes pressure is very difficult to deal with. I've eyes problems since I remember as a person. As I'm getting older and it seems my daddy feels at easy as I'm trying to learn about my eyes issues and want to deal with them the best way I can myself.  </p><p> </p><p>I've been having problems with my new glasses since my last one has been broken when playing soccer. I've got a new one with three parts lenses as daddy's says and it seems they weren't well fitted, I think. I'd have problems before I got used to bifocals, lol. Maybe I was doing the same your son's is doing, ,so my dad just fitted my glasses strap thigh to my face and somehow I'd felt better for some days. But at the first chance, I asked if couldn't I get rid of those things, one rather fit with my older glasses than with those ones. The doctors didn't objected. Yippee. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We're leaving UK by Tuesday's, parting from Berwick upon Tweed. I hope I can get a job backback in São Paulo but I don't hold my expectations too high. </p><p> </p><p>I'm sorry but I'm still working at the how I see the world thing. </p><p> </p><p>Tchau, got to go. </p><p> </p><p>Anderson out. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

And it's freaking cold here.  </p><p> </p><p>Any ways, here I am again. Boo. ?. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When I was a baby I lived in an orphanage here in São Paulo. I swear to God it was a good orphanage this one. I'll came back to that later. Now, I thank my sweet God I'm not a disabled kid. I'd always felt extraordinarily normal. The fact is,  I've learned I'd something wrong with my eyes only when I was about 4 maybe, when I've been taken to a hospital for the first time. The ride was great and the hospital visiting, simply unbelievable. Until then I thought I was normal.  My eyes had never impaired me nor caused anything different or caused me to change the way I was... I mean, my peers never allowed me to feel different. After all, there were some 2 or 3 hundreds kids is had to compete with. So, not an Aphakia nor even nystagmus or the CFEOM would stop me.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CFEOM or Congenital Fibrosis of Extra ocular Muscles affects all the eyes muscles to various extentions and ways, from some missing muscles to messing with some of those muscles. For instance,  I have over four... my daddy says I have four of them totally missing in both my eyes. Three of them are the internal and external laterals muscles in both eyes,  accordingly to medic digital scanners. I have four eyes muscles completely miswired to the extention that my brain completely ignores the order they give to function properly, causing my eyes to go to inverse direction they are ordered to mainly. Mostly "up" or "down" direction or left or right movements, or where when they should contract they will not contract or will not move at all due to inability of those muscles to move. So sometimes I have one eye that goes up while the other remains in its place or move into my nose causing my eyes to adopt extremely crossing positions. Or the other eye simply close when I attempt to look right or left. The only two healthy of my eyes muscles, one in each one eye and one fibrosed and one is  simply paralyzed so they all do their best to overcome those mishap mechanisms. That means most of my eyes muscles are somehow compromised.  All of this is caused by this CFEOM shit thing. This brings to my mind the called by some doctors Duane syndrome or Stilling syndrome. It also gives my eyes the Brown syndrome type C classification I think. Add to this thing a so called Latent Nystagmus and there you'll have me. Lol. Now, please understand that all these things I'm telling you took ages for me to understand myself, so I fear maybe I can't make myself clear, but I'm really trying. Nystagmus is only thing that doesn't bothers me, if I can/am able to control or avoid it and usually I do control it,  so its okay. And trust me, it is the worst of my problems if I can not control it. It will causes me some of the worst sea sickness feeling I have and the sickness is unbearable. the world's moves up and down and swirls badly. Somehow my brain learned to deal with all those differences things within my eyes and I learned to be comfortable with this eyes thing.  Just that. I'm no smart nor any genius or Greek.  I'm just me.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Please trust me on this,  I'm not a too different from anybody elses guy and I don't have any other eyes abnormality, hum... maybe one or two and the very bad and the meanest strabismus ever and I'll come back to that later. But when it comes to me, I wonder if could have those little things prevented people from adopting me? Yes, I think it did indeed. Vanity simply. Lol.  </p><p> </p><p>For you guys to understand it, there are mainly two type of strabismus. The pure mechanical/ physical strabismus, the easily manageable and treatable. And the sensorial strabismus ones. Unlucky of me, I belong to the latest one due to aphakia and nystagmus and others motives.  </p><p> </p><p>Next thing, I'll try to mix both Aphakia and Cfeom to give you the whole painting in trying to accomplish.  </p><p> </p><p>I hope I am not boring you with all those things, honestly, but it helps me somehow to share these things with whoever wants to listen and acknowledge about it. Have it in mind I'm not doctor but a available very lousy student only.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I'm out for now, got to get some sleep.  </p><p> </p><p>4eyes out.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

My eyes had never impaired me nor caused anything different or caused me to change the way I was... I mean, my peers never allowed me to feel different. After all, there were some 2 or 3 hundreds kids is had to compete with. So, not an Aphakia nor even nystagmus or the CFEOM would stop me.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>CFEOM or Congenital Fibrosis of Extra ocular Muscles affects all the eyes muscles to various extentions and ways, from some missing muscles to messing with some of those muscles. For instance,  I have over four... my daddy says I have four of them totally missing in both my eyes. Three of them are the internal and external laterals muscles in both eyes,  accordingly to medic digital scanners. I have four eyes muscles completely miswired to the extention that my brain completely ignores the order they give to function properly, causing my eyes to go to inverse direction they are ordered to mainly. Mostly "up" or "down" direction or left or right movements, or where when they should contract they will not contract or will not move at all due to inability of those muscles to move. So sometimes I have one eye that goes up while the other remains in its place or move into my nose causing my eyes to adopt extremely crossing positions. Or the other eye simply close when I attempt to look right or left. The only two healthy of my eyes muscles, one in each one eye and one fibrosed and one is  simply paralyzed so they all do their best to overcome those mishap mechanisms. That means most of my eyes muscles are somehow compromised.  All of this is caused by this CFEOM shit thing. This brings to my mind the called by some doctors Duane syndrome or Stilling syndrome. It also gives my eyes the Brown syndrome type C classification I think. Add to this thing a so called Latent Nystagmus and there you'll have me. Lol. Now, please understand that all these things I'm telling you took ages for me to understand myself, so I fear maybe I can't make myself clear, but I'm really trying. Nystagmus is only thing that doesn't bothers me, if I can/am able to control or avoid it and usually I do control it,  so its okay. And trust me, it is the worst of my problems if I can not control it. It will causes me some of the worst sea sickness feeling I have and the sickness is unbearable. the world's moves up and down and swirls badly. Somehow my brain learned to deal with all those differences things within my eyes and I learned to be comfortable with this eyes thing.  Just that. I'm no smart nor any genius or Greek.  I'm just me.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Please trust me on this,  I'm not a too different from anybody elses guy and I don't have any other eyes abnormality, hum... maybe one or two and the very bad and the meanest strabismus ever and I'll come back to that later. But when it comes to me, I wonder if could have those little things prevented people from adopting me? Yes, I think it did indeed. Vanity simply. Lol.  </p><p> </p><p>For you guys to understand it, there are mainly two type of strabismus. The pure mechanical/ physical strabismus, the easily manageable and treatable. And the sensorial strabismus ones. Unlucky of me, I belong to the latest one due to aphakia and nystagmus and others motives.  </p><p> </p><p>Next thing, I'll try to mix both Aphakia and Cfeom to give you the whole painting in trying to accomplish.  </p><p> </p><p>I hope I am not boring you with all those things, honestly, but it helps me somehow to share these things with whoever wants to listen and acknowledge about it. Have it in mind I'm not doctor but a available very lousy student only.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I'm out for now, got to get some sleep.  </p><p> </p><p>4eyes out.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2014, 17:21</p><p>I'm sorry about paying twice the same topic. I must be doing something wrong. </p><p> </p><p>Well, here it is.  </p><p> </p><p>I have this idea I'm working on. That's too explain the way I am, or whatever.  </p><p>to explain the way I see the world won't be an easy task, but let's give it a try. I have a condition that I lack the internal eyes lenses. This is a bilateral thing, that means it affects both my eyes. If you imagine a guy with cataracts in his both eyes you'll have an idea how this guy sees. It seems he will see the world as if it is a very fog day. Imagine it is very early in the morning after a long raining night and that you live in a country side or near a forest. Very grossly, that's how you would see the world. I'm sorry I can't be more elaborated than this, but just to give you an idea the way I see things. Due to cataracts both the internal lenses of an individual must to be removed because of the cloud build inside his eyes lenses and internal lenses will be inserted into the empty cloud internal lenses just removed. Voilà. The individual will see the world as normal as it has always been, possible thanks to the new lenses just inserted. That's it. </p><p>Well, I have a condition called Aphakia. Let's return to the guy who had the cataracts removed. Right? If the individual we are talking about doesn't have financial condition to get those internal lenses he get some very special glasses for him be able to see clearly again. This is whatever I do have as far as I can remember. Add to this the empty space left by the not developed internal lenses capsule and you will find a Hugely free space inside your ocular globe to also added to your glasses lenses prescription if those capsules never developed. Now, can you imagine somebody using a glasses that "should be gone" long time ago? Say... some forty or fifth years ago? Well I'm a guy who's sick stuck with those likely glasses. Oh, let's not forget the "nystagmus" thing that comes with the Aphakia, right?  </p><p>I really hope you guys are following me.  </p><p> </p><p>Now, let's get back to when I was a baby and lived in an orphanage with some others 200 babies and kids. It was a very funny way to live and i don't complain about that, according to doctors, I have learned to live using somehow all the others senses to answers to my brain demands and not dye to young. Our brain is capable of wonders accordingly to doctors, as they still don't have a right name to my eyes condition. Lol. I still enjoy the puzzle looks the UCLA, in USA, the Queen Mary University or the Moorefield hospital or São Paulo University's USP, goofs around me just to take a peak or asks me questions about this thing my eyes is. And honestly, I don't know nothing about it too. And then there's the other eye condition I do have. The Congenital Fibrosis of the Extra ocular Muscles or the CFEOM. And this thing sucks indeed.  </p><p> </p><p>I will continue later, have to go to sleep or my daddy will spank me, lol. Just kidding, he is the best.  </p><p> </p><p>4eyes out. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2013, 09:56</p><p>Phillip, </p><p>Moving PLUS lenses closer to your eyes REDUCES the effective optical power of the lenses.  I suspect idea 2 is the reason he is trying to get the glasses closer to his eyes. There are two ways of writing an optical prescription Ophthalmologists typically use + cylinder and Optometrists typically use - cylinder.  Lens makers convert the + cylinder to - cylinder using a simple formula and make the glasses, the optical result is the same.  In - cylinder format, your son's prescription for distance is Sphere +24, cylinder is -6.  reading is +32 cylinder -6.  The reason I did the conversion is to determine the Vertex Distance (VD) effects of his prescription.  It is approximately 0.57 diopters per mm </p><p>In an ideal world, he should probably wear trifocals, but that is probably not possible with the type glasses he has to wear. </p><p>I have some ideas I would like to share with you, but I am out of time right now to write more.  May I ask your son's age and where you live? </p><p>Will try to write more later today. </p><p>C </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2013, 09:33</p><p>Hi Phillip, </p><p> </p><p>With such a high prescription, he'll suffer from a greatly reduced field of view, creating large blind areas. </p><p> </p><p>This can be offset slightly by moving the lenses closer to his eyes giving a wider field of view.  With a high RX a little can be a lot. </p><p> </p><p>Alternatively it could be that the newer prescription is too strong, the closer they are to his eyes the weaker they are. </p><p> </p><p>Hope this helps (I wear glasses in the + double digits) </p><p> </p><p>Regards</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2013, 01:34</p><p>Nearsighted Girl, </p><p>The minification is caused by two factors, the minus power of the lens and the distance from your cornea to the back surface of the lens.  The only way to reduce the minification effects are to reduce the lens power of the glasses or get the lenses closer to your cornea.  The obvious way to reduce the distance is to wear contact lenses with full correction, if that is not possible, you may be able to wear a modified form of Glasses Over Contacts (GOC) by doing a partial correction with contacts and the balance with glasses. </p><p>Most Eye Care Professionals (ECP) will not think of the last as an option, they are used to doing all the correction using ONE technique.  The idea of doing two partial corrections doesn't enter their minds. </p><p>It would be helpful if you could provide your complete prescription. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

So you could say he allowed you to do your own eye exam. Personally I think this is a doctor you should keep. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yolanda</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2013, 19:13</p><p>He apparently was right.  I went back today.  I sat in the chair.  He set the refraction machine to -6.50 and -7.00, the same as in my glasses.  He put my hand on a wheel that made the lens stronger or weaker and told me to turn it until the chart was as sharp as I could get it.  He said to take my time and go back and forth until I was sure.  Then he did the same with the other side.  Then he asked me to look at the front of the machine and see what numbers I had picked.  -8.50 and -9.00.  One eye the same as him and the other slightly stronger.  I then went and ordered new glasses with his prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2013, 03:55</p><p>Yolanda, </p><p> </p><p>You could ask the optometrist office to make up a trial set of lenses.  You wear them about the office looking at various distances and see if the Rx is both accurate and comfortable.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus jack</b>&nbsp;08 Aug 2013, 11:48</p><p>Yolanda, </p><p>There are two possibilities for the sphere increase: </p><p>You have in fact become more myopic since you got your last glasses, as explained in previous replies. </p><p>Prior to the exam, you did a lot of close reading and developed some pseudo myopia.  There are two kinds of myopia.  Axial or true myopia is caused by a mismatch between the length of your eyeballs and the total power of your eyes lens system.  Axial myopia is permanent because growth is involved.  Pseudo or false myopia is caused by your ciliary muscles and crystalline lenses being slow to relax after doing a lot of close work.  With your distance vision corrected to 20/20 or 6/6 your crystalline lenses must increase their plus power to focus close.  The amount of the increase can be calculated by using the formula developed by Sir Isaac Newton, of gravity fame, back around 1700.  The formula is easy, just divide the focus distance into 100 cm or 39.37 inches depending on your preferred units of measure.  For example if you like to read at 40 cm or 16 inches, your crystalline lenses have to supply the additional +2.50 to let you do it.  If you are texting on a cell phone, you are likely focusing even closer. </p><p>Possible solutions: </p><p>Get a dilated or wet exam from an ophthalmologist (preferably one that specialized in progressive myopia), a different optometrist or optician.  The dilating agents will temporarily paralyze your ciliary muscles and may let your crystalline lenses relax at least partially. </p><p>Avoid reading or any close focusing task for the day prior to the exam, particularly avoid reading or texting while waiting for the exam. </p><p>If you like or need to read a lot, I strongly suggest consider getting bifocals, progressives, or using prescription reading glasses (with reduced minus).  You didnt provide your complete prescription with any cylinder or axis, but if they are very close, an older pair of glasses with less minus might help for reading.  If a person is genetically disposed for myopia, and I strongly suspect you are, your visual  environment with lots of close focusing demand, encourages excessive eyeball growth and rapidly increasing myopia. </p><p>You or your Eye Care Professional (ECP) may be tempted to under prescribe, but there is some evidence that under prescribing may not be beneficial for progressive myopia. </p><p>Often in progressive myopia, genetics play a very significant role.  Are either of your parents or any of your grandparents myopic?  </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;08 Aug 2013, 01:19</p><p>Yolanda, </p><p> </p><p>It is quite a big increase, although not unheard of at your age.  At this stage all you are looking at is numbers on a sheet of paper, so you have two realistic options: </p><p> </p><p>1. Go to a different optometrist and seek a second opinion. </p><p>2. Get the glasses made at the place where you were given the new Rx and then, if there is a problem with how you see through them, you should be able to get them to retest your eyes and check the Rx was correct. </p><p> </p><p>Another possible reason for the large increase is that you may have been underprescribed last time, but have been given your full correction this time.  The former could have happened in an attempt to prevent your eyes from deteriorating so fast, whereas the latter might have been a response to something you said about how well you see.  A lot of short-sighted people who are studying hard find that they experience several larger-than-typical increases in their Rx because of the amount of time spent looking at books or computer screens, so there is probably nothing much to worry about.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yolanda</b>&nbsp;07 Aug 2013, 22:51</p><p>How can I tell if my optometrist overprescribed me?  I'm a high school junior and I have nearsighted eyes. I just went to him to get a new prescription for going back to school. I knew it would be stronger. When I read the eye chart with my glasses on, I could see line 4 with my right eye and line 3 with my left. The glasses I am wearing are -6.50 for my right eye and -7.00 for the left. The new prescription he gave me says -8.25 for the right and -9.00 for the left. That seems like a horribly big increase since last year. Is it possible that my eyes got that much worse? Please tell me what to do. Should I get the prescription filled and hope I see ok with the new glasses? Or go back to the doctor and complain? I'm not sure what to do.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2013, 03:47</p><p>"Boyfriend in shock" - if this isn't some made up story but a fantasist, you are one lucky guy!! Many women who are even a little myopic, let alone as short sighted as this are a self conscious of wearing glasses, and I'm not suprised that she's wearing contact lenses, as your reaction on here as kind of exemplified her not telling you about her glasses. At minus 13, her glasses - as you have now seen - will be rather (deliciously) thick, and strong and display lots of power rings/cut in and this is probably another reason as to why she hasn't worn them.  </p><p> </p><p>This is the sort of stuff we dream of, and I can't begin to imagine how much I'd spend in the bedroom if I had a girlfriend who was -13. She needs reassurance that she is even more attractive with her glasses on, and that complimenting on how good she looks when she is wearing them, and I'm sure this will increase her confidence in wearing them. Please elaborate on how things have progressed since your 'discovery'.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2013, 12:06</p><p>juicebox </p><p> Like "Boyfriend in shock's" girlfriend your not being at all dishonest either, but it's interesting that you have been in a relationship for 2 months and your bf doesn't know you need glasses (or contacts)? You don't think he would dump you if he suddenly were to see you wearing glasses, do you? Maybe some evening when your out you should just comment that your contacts are bothering you, to see his reaction.  </p><p>Unlike "Boyfriend in shock's" gf your glasses are not nearly as strong and probably look really attractive as well. You never know your bf could be one of us. lol</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2013, 11:51</p><p>Boyfriend in Shock </p><p>Like the others have said, your discovery of your girlfriend of 3 months need for strong glasses somehow your thinking she has been dishonest with you for not telling you. You seem like she is flawed because she doesn't have 20/20 vision? But until you saw her glasses next to her bed as far as you knew she did have perfect vision so what's the big deal if her vision is only perfect because of her contacts? If she was trying to hide the fact that her vision isn't perfect she probably wouldn't have left her glasses in plain sight. If she had been trying to hide the fact that she wears correction she would have likely been upset with you finding them and not discussed her vision needs.  </p><p>She has no doubt probably been wearing contacts for a very long time and it just isn't a big deal that she feels she needs to advertise. Just because there are many in here that would find her wearing -13.00 glasses a huge turn-on she doesn't know that and to her she probably feels she much more appealing without her strong glasses.  </p><p>Here's a question for you, if she had been wearing her glasses when you met her would you have found her as attractive and asked her out anyway? So now that you know she wears glasses are you going to suggest that she should wear her glasses if she wants? I'm sure your approval would be helpful.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>juicebox</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2013, 06:21</p><p>@boyfriend in shock  </p><p> </p><p>As a girl I can maybe help answer the question from my experience. Though I do wear glasses sometimes, I mostly wear contacts. I just feel a lot more confident and prettier without them. I've been in a relationship with a guy for 2 months and he still hasn't seen me wear mine. I'm not saying all girls are the same but I always make a conscious effort to look nice for my boyfriend as he does the same for me, so maybe she subconsciously thinks she looks better without glasses and wants you to see her that way. That's only me assuming though and I'm sure you know that when we assume we make an ass out of you and me... </p><p>My advice would be to not distrust her because of this, I'm certainly not hiding anything from my boyfriend, he just hasn't seen me in glasses, that's all. You seem to be in a great relationship though so congrats! :) Also, quick question, do you wear glasses regularly in front of her?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Boyfriend in shock</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2013, 00:58</p><p>I've been in a relationship with a particular girl for 3 months and I thought I knew most everything important about her.  I mean, we have great sex, etc.  I always assumed she had 20/20 vision.  Well, maybe it's 20/1,000, I just discovered.  Until last night, I didn't have a clue.  When she went to the bathroom, I noticed an eyeglass case on her night table.  Curious, I peeked inside.  There were glasses.  I took them out, and as I did, I realized that they were very thick. </p><p> </p><p>The edges of the lenses stuck way out from the frame, there were loads of concentric circles, and everything looked tiny. I decided to ask her (nicely) about them.  She didn't take it badly.  She admitted they were hers.  She said she wears contacts and didn't think anything about it, it just wasn't important.  My glasses are -4 so I have some basis of comparison.  She said her prescription is -13.  I was like wow!  I cannot believe this! </p><p> </p><p>Do you think she should have said something before now?  Or am I being out of line?  I can't help but wonder what else she is concealing, like is she diabetic or has some other serious disease.</p><p></p><hr>

It is time to return to doctors in one of quarterly schedule visits, that I dread and I hate so much... no matter whatever other people says. I am into this shit since my seven or eight years old. </p><p> </p><p>Since I remember I'd eyes problems. Cumbersomeness and bumpy, funny appearance and looking weird and always the reason of the jokes made me become a very shy and lone kid. At four I was living in streets and due to my bad sight and severe "turning in" eyes, it was very easy to beg for money. I learned about my condition at 7. I hated when every doctor who would see me would call every other doctors to check my eyes. They would tell me I'd Duane in both my eyes and that they moved somewhat awkwardly. Later I learned it was due to CFEOM, a very special type of strabismus, where my eyes have some missing muscles that would make things worsen. and because I lack those internal lenses into my eyes and then there is this nasty nystagmus... blah, blah, blah.  </p><p> </p><p>Anyway I hate strabismus and I hate nystagmus. but some how I overcome my shyness back then. Today i find it annoying, my hated strabismus and nystagmus and very thick eyeglasses, keep out of jobs that I apply to. Actually I'm working as a general clerk at a mall here in Sao Paulo, so I am very thankful I've got this job. </p><p> </p><p>After this dread week of my quarterly eyes doctor visiting schedule, my distrust on medics only got worse, as they say "my eyes got worse". I swear I feel nothing different. I know I can't see a turd right in front of me. But I know that and my daddy knows that. But then... how come my eyeglasses lenses got a bit weak. It as dropped to about + 43:75 and 45:50 and about add +9:50 bottom... my daddy knows al lot better about those numbers. They say my sclera got real strong, but no contacts, not yet... Even my eyes muscles are, somehow, getting some coordinated movements? but doctors says that my problem is my strabismus. Darn thing this strabismus, always this strabismus thing... blah, blah, blah...If all of that is true, how come I'll need some eyes surgery within next months? I really don't get it and I DON'T like it at all. And I don't like those doctors at all. I really don't like those doctors. </p><p> </p><p>Again, I am sorry I am crying just like a kid... </p><p> </p><p>See you guys.</p><p></p><hr>

Its like Crystal Veil's models slowly  appearing all over our cities.  </p><p>Thank you  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eleanor</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2013, 09:35</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions guys. To be honest I'm not sure I'll go down the stick on lens or flip up magnifier route, they're more likely to give the effect I'm trying to avoid, i.e. to be less conspicuous with my close vision impairment. </p><p>The glasses and contact idea is actually something I've done before. When I first got contacts they weren't able to correct my astigmatism so I used spherical cls with a prescription somewhere in the middle of my cyl correction and then had to wear glasses to sharpen things up for things like driving and seeing the board in lectures. It meant that I walked around in a slight blur for 90% of the time but teenage girls tend to put a higher priority on vanity and so I put up with it. It did occur to me that I might try contacts again, either with my reading prescription or my distance prescription and then wear glasses either for distance or close up. I'm so used to glasses, I tend to put them on first thing and forget about them till I go to bed so I was really looking for a hassle free solution that doesn't involve changing between combinations of eyewear every time I want to read something. I may give the Ciliary Blue people a call and see what they can do for me. The thing I don't understand is why multifocals are so hard to come by for higher myopic prescriptions. I mean severely short sighted people do age and become presbyopic don't they? </p><p>I've also been considering surgery, either lens extraction or implants but I'm not exactly delighted at the prospect if another solution can be found. I'm an avid reader and I imagine my close vision is only going to get worse so I need to work something out soon. To be honest I quite like wearing my glasses, they're part of me and I feel naked without them. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2013, 02:01</p><p>Eleanor, </p><p> </p><p>here are two additional suggestions, based on first nose experience by my life partner Nel. Background information: I first tried to order a pair of progressives for her at Zenni Optical but, as it turned out, they don't go higher with bifocal / progressive lenses than -10.00. </p><p>First solution: I ordered a pair of Zenni glasses with single vision lenses (for long distance) and then ordered +2.50 reading segments at stickonlens. The price for this combination was well below 50 GBP. I had no problem at cutting the stickonlens reading segments and gluing them in the proper position on the single vision lenses. However, Nel is used to progressives and she could not get used to the bifocals so I thought of an alternative. </p><p>Second solution: I ordered another pair of Zenni glasses without lenses in them and then sent the frame to ciliaryblue in England. They fitted the frame with progressive lenses and these worked perfect for Nel. The frame was less than 20 GBP and the lenses costed 200 GBP (100 each). The lenses are 1.74 premier elite with a wide reading segment and Nel said that they gave her better view than her own glasses bought at the local optician for over 1000 GBP. In fact, she now wears three pairs of Zenni glasses with these progressive lenses by ciliaryblue. </p><p>Nel has a prescription of around minus twelve and this was no problem with ciliaryblue. Although the first frame was rather big, the lenses are only six millimeters thick at the edge. Nel never returned to her old glasses after this. </p><p>Your prescription is higher than Nel's but still below -20 (cylinders included). Zenni manufactures single vision lenses up to -20.00. I'm fairly sure that ciliaryblue can make you progressive lenses in your own prescription. We did not need to pay extra for Nel's high prescription. So my suggestion is, try ciliaryblue and ask them if they have an upper limit for 1.74 elite progressive lenses. Their staff is very helpful and the glasses arrived within three weeks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2013, 23:39</p><p>Eleanor, </p><p>I have done a little research on offerings by 2 well known on-line retailers. </p><p>Zenni Optical is one of our favorites for low cost, high quality glasses and Optical4less is one of our favorites for unusual prescription lenses.  The snag on getting glasses with your prescription is the bifocal.  Either one offers Single Vision glasses with your distance prescription.  Again, I suspect the problem is getting lens blanks for your prescription with bifocal segments for a reasonable cost.  You can get some very strong and unusual prescriptions made, but they are extremely costly. </p><p>There may be a couple of ways to solve the problem that might be worth considering as a relatively low cost experiment.  A cost so low that even if you wound up not being able to wear the glasses, you would not be out very much. </p><p>I priced some single vision glasses in an inexpensive frame with your distance prescription and no options such as hi index or anti-reflective coating.  The total less shipping was US$16.00.   </p><p>For the bifocal/reading segment, 3M makes some + Press-on lenses for reading that might be worth considering.  They are also relatively inexpensive, available in several different powers, and are pretty easy to apply and remove.  I suspect the front surface of the glasses would be flat also and therefore really easy to apply the press-ons, </p><p>Another low cost possibility are clip on, flip up magnifiers.  They are about US$20.00 and available in a good range of + powers.  I use them when I am working extensively with the computer to keep from having to tilt my head to use the intermediate segment in my trifocals. </p><p>The really off-the-wall thought, if you could comfortably wear high moisture single vision, sphere only contacts, would be to correct a significant portion of your sphere correction using contacts and put the   remaining sphere, cylinder, axis and ADD in glasses.  A form of GOC (Glasses Over Contacts), if you will.  Sphere only contacts are pretty inexpensive and if we could get the remainder of your prescription low enough (very likely), you could get rather ordinary bifocals for a pretty reasonable cost. </p><p>Some of these experiments you could, with our help, try on your own.  The GOC experiment might require the assistance of an open minded Eye Care Professional. </p><p>Please look these over, and let me know if any of them are interesting and/or have any appeal. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

I have a few pairs lying around and wear them very occasionally when glasses are very inconvenient but that's it. I never found them terribly comfortable, I seem to have dry eyes and a large part of the reason I rarely bother with them now is that I just can't see to read in them at all. </p><p>4.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2013, 16:51</p><p>That is a common problem for people who need very strong prescriptions.  The problem is that the bifocal/multifocal segment(s) are molded into the plastic blanks that are the starting point for almost all glasses lenses and there are few sources of blanks that are suitable for very high prescriptions that have the segments molded in.  You might be able to get some glasses made by specialty lens labs, but they would be costly. </p><p>I have some less expensive ideas that you might find useful, but I need to ask a few questions to see if my ideas fit your situation. </p><p>1. Where do you live? (Country) </p><p>2. Do your glasses lenses have flat fronts or are they even slightly concave? </p><p>3. Are you able to wear contact lenses?  (Please don't make any assumptions about the reason for my question, if you can, my suggestion might surprise you and your Eye Care Professional) </p><p>4.

<p><b>Eleanor</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2013, 11:00</p><p>Not sure if this right thread but I have a question that someone can maybe help me with. I've always been very short-sighted but having reached the age where reading is becoming increasingly difficult I've been prescribed a reading add at my last three eye exams. However, actually acquiring bifocals or multifocals in my prescription is proving very difficult. Most online retailers just don't seem to provide them at all and my local optical stores want me to part with large sums of my hard earned cash. I'm "lucky" in that I'm so myopic that I only have to move my glasses a few mm down my nose and they miraculously become reading glasses but it would be nice to have the real thing so that I don't have to take on the look of my gran every time I want to read something. My friend has a -6 distance prescription with a +2 add and has no difficulty getting hold of multifocals. My distance rx in my weaker eye is -17.50, although it did top out at over -19.00 in my twenties so it appears I'm getting less myopic with the advancing years (every cloud.....) and my add is +2. Anyone have any advice for a lady new to the presbyopia game?</p><p></p><hr>

'till my friend tell me with a link up and running.  </p><p> </p><p>I hope all you guys are just doing great.  </p><p> </p><p>I am at the limit of my eyes developing and really glad and hope fully I can get a real and a final decisive and straightforward treatments and not only guessing. As for my eyes, due to stem cells treatment, I have strong sclera and my eyes don't scratches easily and I might even be supportive to some very specials lenses, I hope.  My eyes lenses regressed to and maintained the +45 and +47,50 add +12,75 for over the last year and half only strabismus getting complicated due to muscles tightness and looseness,  if that makes any sense and the "latent nystagmus" the most annoying of my shit lousy eyes. The best way to avoid the nystagmus occurrences is to not move my eyes from certains positions but the head instead and people looks at me puzzled, because some times I put my head at some weird positions.  I will do anything, but no "nystagmus". </p><p> </p><p>I am working actually, and somehow l play soccer with my friends, when I am allowed. I go to Park to ride my bike shouting out "beware my friend..." who's the worst stammer I've ever met but who is the best soccer player I've met. Life is great and cool and that's it.  </p><p> </p><p>4eyes out and happy to meet you all again. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;13 Apr 2013, 12:44</p><p>The basics I know about are things like hold the mirror close and use short brushes etc - if possible, saw the end off a longer one. You are probably about the upper limit of doing it without correction - the contact lens thing is good, but no use if you can't wear them. Another suggestion might be to use two pairs of old glasses: one with the left lens missing, one the right - the old RX might be well out of date for distance, but should be usable within arms length. </p><p> </p><p>Obviously, you want to make your eyes bigger and bolder to counteract the shrinkage and having a lens in front. I'm assuming that your lenses have anti-reflect, there's no point doing make up if people can't see it. There's lots of glasses/makeup videos on youtube, some are linked from this site. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ellie</b>&nbsp;13 Apr 2013, 00:59</p><p>Not sure if this is the most appropriate thread, but does anyone who is on the more myopic end of things have tips for applying eye makeup? I usually pop in one contact and do my makeup and then pop it back out to wear glasses, but sometimes that defeats the purpose.  </p><p>By the way, I am -14.50 right and -12.50 left. </p><p></p><hr>

And I used to know an ophthalmologist who was known to do eye tests and prescribe glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2012, 08:29</p><p>In UK , there are hospitals such as Western Eye Hospital , with doctors (physicians).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2012, 05:47</p><p>Astra: on the contrary, the guy I'm thinking of was medically qualified but practised at an optician's shop where he tested eys and prescribed glasses. But no doubt his medical knowledge enabled him to give more specialized care at times. Packed away *somewhere* I have a paperback called 'The Book of the Eye' which goes into all these subtleties. If I ver find it I'll let you know!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2012, 04:09</p><p>Re: Julian  </p><p> </p><p>"who used to be called an ophthalmic medical practitioner and is (in UK terms) a doctor who practises optometry" </p><p> </p><p>I assume they practises opthamology. They are professionally, specialist physicians.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2012, 02:01</p><p>Yes Clare, but these days ophthalmic opticians often prefer to be called optometrists (just as graduate chiropodists call themselves podiatrists). I think their professional qualification is FBOA - Fellow of the British Ophthalmic Association. My original optician was FSMC (Fellow of the Spectacle-Makers' Corporation) but I have an idea these professional bodies have amalgamated. </p><p>But there is another species you haven't mentioned, who used to be called an ophthalmic medical practitioner and is (in UK terms) a doctor who practises optometry. It was one of these who, all those years ago, insisted I need to wear glasses full time, but got the cylinder component wrong and caused me discomfort in my left eye till my next test.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2012, 00:24</p><p>Re: Clare 05 Jun 2012, 14:31 </p><p> </p><p>Opthamologist are one of specialist physicians . </p><p> </p><p>Specialist physicians include : cardiologist, dermatologist, endocrinologist, gastroentologist, geriatrician, gynaecologist, immunologist, maxillo-facial surgeon, microbiologist, neonatologist, nephrologist, neurologist, opthamologist, orthopaedist, otorhinolaryngologist, paediatrician, pathologist, pneumologist, psychiatrist, radiologist, rheumatologist, urologist, venerologist.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2012, 14:31</p><p>Soundmanpt - its slightly different here in the UK, we have ophthalmic and dispensing opticians, no doctors. The ophthalmic opticians are the ones who are the equivalent of doctors in the US I think. It was the ophthalmic optician, the one who can determine prescription as well as make glasses, who said mine were strong. I was surprised too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2012, 09:34</p><p>Clare </p><p> </p><p>It all has to do with what and how we get used to seeing. But your correct that someone with a very weak or mild prescription will comment that they are blind without their glasses. But that is caused by them wearing their glasses full time and even though they certainly are not dependent on them they still hate not seeing everything perfectly clear as they can with their glasses. A good friend who is only wearing -1.25 glasses wears hers full time and just never wants to be without them. She knows that they aren't strong but she really enjoys her vision with glasses. Was it your doctor or the optician that told you your -2.75 / -2.25 glasses were strong? I can't imagine any doctor saying that. But if the optician was rather new at the job and she didn't wear glasses yours may have seemed strong to her. Most that I deal with seem to feel their glasses are strong when they get in the mid 2's, and of course it's not but I think it is more because that is when you rally notice the difference much more when you take your glasses off than say when you were only around -1.00. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2012, 01:24</p><p>Asdoo - I think it depends. I've known people who claim they can't see a thing without their glasses which are not very strong glasses but they seem to think they are blind without them, when I wore a -2.75 and -2.25 prescription my optician said my correction was quite strong, I had never thought it to be. I think many people over -3 would feel their prescription is strong simply because they are very limited in what they can do without them. I don't think many people understand that prescriptions can get as high as -10 and above so they think theirs is strong, its all relative!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2012, 00:13</p><p>What is the bigger problem? To be very strong farsighted (+ 20 dpt) or extremely short-sighted (- 20 dpt)?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Asdoo</b>&nbsp;19 May 2012, 12:34</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p>I already know about that. I was talking about what prescription the average person considers strong. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;19 May 2012, 11:11</p><p>Asdoo </p><p> </p><p>Not sure what you want to know but maybe this will help. There are 2 types of eye doctors. An optometrist is the most common and can be found working at most optical shops. They are qualified to do eye examines and fittings for contacts as well as prescribing glasses. However they cannot do any type of eye surgery. For that you would need an optimologist. Now when you get your eyes examined and you have astigmatism an optometrist will write the rx with a minus in front of the numbers, such as -1.00 for the cylinder but if you were to go to an optimologist it would be written with a plus sign, such as +1.00.  </p><p>As you might guess the optometrist charges much less as well.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Asdoo</b>&nbsp;19 May 2012, 03:00</p><p>Thanks for the responses. Does anyone know anything about plus or cylinder prescriptions?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>varifocals</b>&nbsp;18 May 2012, 05:46</p><p>Strong glasses. </p><p>Yes it can depend on individuals &amp; their tolerances. </p><p>It seems to me though for -3 &amp; above for safety reasons both to the waerer &amp; others the glasses should be worn full time. Yes -8 &amp; upwards is getting strong, bearing in mind that with - 20 you have 3 inches of vision bare eyed according to those in that bracket. </p><p>In my case I am a plussie so have different problems.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;18 May 2012, 03:58</p><p>Asdoo, like CV has said, everyone seems to have their own interpretation of what is strong. How people can say -3 is strong I don't know as I've had an ex girlfriend wear -3.50's out and about when she had 20/20 vision - yes she did!! - and she never complained about them being strong. </p><p> </p><p>For me, strong would be above -8, anything below this is bordering on uninteresting!! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;16 May 2012, 14:06</p><p>Asdoo, </p><p> </p><p>my experience at photo shoots with models who have perfect eyesight: some models start calling glasses "strong" at -3.00, other models don't call glasses "strong" until they are -5.00 or -6.00.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Asdoo</b>&nbsp;16 May 2012, 13:22</p><p>Varifocals </p><p>Sorry I wasn't clear. I'm not that good at explaining myself in writing. You know when people with perfect vision try on other peoples glasses. How strong do they have to be for the person trying them on to say they're strong? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>varifocals</b>&nbsp;16 May 2012, 12:08</p><p>asdoo. </p><p>Sorry but apart from a picture of black framed glasses I could get nothing else</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Asdoo</b>&nbsp;16 May 2012, 02:01</p><p>I know most people here consider anything above +/-10 strong.

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2012, 10:29</p><p>I wonder whether the main reason for the preference in high-myopes is that you can see their eyes better at more angles, whereas if the wearer has a high plus prescription they need to be looking almost directly at you for you to be able to appreciate their eyes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>interested</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2012, 06:40</p><p>Is ther a formula to work out how much field of vision a person with plus glasses would have based on their rx and vertex distance? </p><p> </p><p>I.e. How much fov with +10 versus +15? </p><p> </p><p>Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

I dont wear bifocals due to high prism correction but have two pairs of glasses ,distance and reading and have to change around. my latest prescription gave me .50 more add, so now full reading script is +14/+16.75 Hope this answers your questions.

<p><b>Mylene</b>&nbsp;21 Feb 2012, 02:24</p><p>Glad your friend adapted to her glasses , but no reason she should not. I wear quite strong plus lenses and dont really find them a problem, apart from applying my makeup, but thats another story. My full prescription is R+10.50 L+13.25 +add 3 with base out prisms. My eyes turn in rather bad when i dont have my glasses on. I started with glasses at 3 years old, think my first rx was around +3 according to my mother. I am 24 years of age</p><p></p><hr>


<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2012, 16:14</p><p>David </p><p> </p><p>I'm glad your friend is being positive about having to wear strong plus lenses and is resuming a more or less normal life. </p><p>A few years ago I was told I had the 'beginnings' of cataracts and I've been impatient to have lensectomies, believing that when the time comes I'll have the courage to request that I not be given implants.  For family and friends I would need to invent a story along the lines of your friend's actual experience. </p><p>As I am also a low myope, it is reassuring to know that there is the possibility of going to +17d.  That is pretty close to my desired Rx of about +20d.  Sadly, however, my cataracts seem very slow to develop. </p><p>I wish her all the best.  I'm sure she looks lovely wearing her +17d lenticular bi-focals. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2011, 13:40</p><p>Hey, </p><p> </p><p>Its been a while since i last posted some questions about my family friend who had cataract surgery and couldn't get iol's. </p><p> </p><p>I have a little more info and I thought some here may be interested. </p><p> </p><p>Apparently the reason she couldn't get the implants was due to the area that they insert them being exceptionally thin in her eyes.  I'm not totally sure what area they are talking about but they said the risk of something rupturing was too high. </p><p> </p><p>She's ended up at +16 and +17 with +4/+4.5 add.  Everyone assumed that she'd have to put her life on hold and rethink everything however she's adapted remarkably well to them and is back at work full time and has actually received a promotion as her employers were very impressed at how dedicated she was to the company (they'd offered her around 2 months paid leave).  She now has to take the bus but it's not a big change and she actually prefers the bus to the car as she was never big on driving anyway. </p><p> </p><p>Her family has gotten to the new change and while everyone at first was very careful and treated her like she was blind soon realized this was not the case. </p><p> </p><p>So thanks everyone for the help and good luck and best wishes for the new year.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;12 Nov 2011, 10:26</p><p>Hello my friends at Eye Scene. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Here's Anderson and  I'm sorry I took do long return. I am just returning from the hospital checking up after my implanted eyes muscles rejecting shitty... after two...  Well, in fact it was supposed to be only some few and little incisions surgery to remove those implanted muscles due to rejection symptoms and one "very small" adjustable procedure to adjust those my eyes to an acceptable position. My last November 4th Friday eyes surgery drove me to an state of utterly insecure and fear, that I've never felt in all those year of eyes shitty things. As doctors said to my daddy, the simple procedure would remove the implanted muscles that was causing rejection was something they've done hundreds times and would be done with a finger snaps, but I think it went wrong and I couldn't see a thing for over couple minutes as I desperately was moving my eyes around the room to no avail and then I was scared and I was jerking and thrusting my head wildly the way I used to do as a little baby so I could move my eyes around back then and I thought my worst nightmare has come true, as the time was passing and the minutes seems to last longer than usual. It seems that my eyes muscles become loose after the implants were removed and I simply was not able to simply move them around to nowhere.  As I realized that the nightmare I dread most I was living it, I silently began to cry and for some crazy moment I'd thought it was funny I was crying do much I could fell my hot tears reaches my butt before I realize I was wetting myself has "I pee" my bed. As I calmed down I could somehow move my eyes and things  began returning and I saw my daddy and my gran mom and I cried again. But everything was really weird and I began to fell sick with nausea, as the world was speeding round and I puke, but  I was intently happy by their sight. Those dick sucking doctors said they were expecting something like that but didn't give any alarming word to me, I felt like shit and wet, and full of shame later. Then I've been put into a funny drugged state and returned to surgery room with my eyes still wide open the next Saturday 5th. Still I think all of this was some really bad dream even after talking to my dad and gran ma. But now I'm home and I am as crosseyed as I always have been and still resting, exercising my eyes as suggests those doctors and playing video game in a very large TV set. Lol. </p><p> </p><p>What I felt this last week was something I didn't know I would ever feel. I'd remembered all my life, like I would never see again and I thought about everything I would miss. I began to think about when I was just a kid.  The fear I'd feel was bigger than the one I'd feel when I've got my eyeglasses stolen when living in the streets. When I was a wee kid, I'd never concerned about the way I looked with those badly crooked eyes that couldn't see a thing after I'd my glasses stolen one day and I can say shamelessly, I learned I could earn real money just sitting and begging by metro or at Se Cathedral. After being adopted, everything has changed and I started to worry about the way I looked and I  began to feel mad or whatever when I realised somebody was staring at me. That is what my daddy calls pride or self esteems and I learned all those things to make my dad  and me myself proud. </p><p> </p><p>I always hated pictures and stuffs but to please my dad I would do anything. Also, I am as an guy ordinary as anybody else is, I began to think, and I even began to enjoy the puzzled look I could see on people faces, when they realized I was not what they expected me to be, as in those many times it happened when I am in the Mall with my dad. And still, it makes me looks cool. I know its a real funny statement to somebody like me to do, but it is. Just like few months ago when again and again, I was walking by a Shopping Mall very close to my home and a guy insisted to talk to me about modelling and stuffs and that was real odd. I told him to talk to my dad, who called me and asked me to take off the "dark shade" I was with. Only then I remembered to put back my ordinary glasses, where my  nystagmus crossing eyes are hugely augmented by its very thick lenses that pops out, but seeing the face the guy and the two accompany ladies did make, almost choked us so much we laughed. Actually I am used to this scene. Not many people likes me because the way I look... few others aside my family.  </p><p> </p><p>I also briefly remembered about a kid who asked me to be cartooned, a palsy kiddo who asked permit to draw me for some reason. We were travelling couple weeks ago, and we were in an open fair when we saw him. Of course I have permitted him, I mean "we" did permit him, as he painted  "me" alone and another paint of us together, me and my daddy. The funny thing that I remembered, is that the kid asked me how I wanted the painting and I didn't get it. My daddy told him "as you please". Only later I understood his asking. Lol. I am a bit slow. I thought I would never see that cartoon again. I'd remembered all those times I'd complained about the way I am or t he way I look, then back to the way I'd live was a wee kid. How silly and how stupid I've been.  </p><p> </p><p>For somebody who is almost + 50 with an adding over + 10 lenses at 19 yo, I am just glad to be the way I am and able to see the way I see. A week has passed since last 4th Friday. After that last Friday I will not go to any other treatment that had anything to do with surgery so frightened I was, at least for awhile. Blindness is my worst nightmare and I thought I was living my dreadest nightmare.  How long that lasted, be it couple minutes or even some seconds whatever, it doesn't matter, I'll remember it for the rest of my life. </p><p> </p><p>I am really sorry I dragged you into this messy thing I am but after this month I think I will never be the same. The sight we have is a lot better than no sight at all, thank you  all guys for your support.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Anderson out.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Then I've been put into a funny drugged state and returned to surgery room with my eyes still wide open the next Saturday 5th. Still I think all of this was some really bad dream even after talking to my dad and gran ma. But now I'm home and I am as crosseyed as I always have been and still resting, exercising my eyes as suggests those doctors and playing video game in a very large TV set. Lol. </p><p> </p><p>What I felt this last week was something I didn't know I would ever feel. I'd remembered all my life, like I would never see again and I thought about everything I would miss. I began to think about when I was just a kid.  The fear I'd feel was bigger than the one I'd feel when I've got my eyeglasses stolen when living in the streets. When I was a wee kid, I'd never concerned about the way I looked with those badly crooked eyes that couldn't see a thing after I'd my glasses stolen one day and I can say shamelessly, I learned I could earn real money just sitting and begging by metro or at Se Cathedral. After being adopted, everything has changed and I started to worry about the way I looked and I  began to feel mad or whatever when I realised somebody was staring at me. That is what my daddy calls pride or self esteems and I learned all those things to make my dad  and me myself proud. </p><p> </p><p>I always hated pictures and stuffs but to please my dad I would do anything. Also, I am as an guy ordinary as anybody else is, I began to think, and I even began to enjoy the puzzled look I could see on people faces, when they realized I was not what they expected me to be, as in those many times it happened when I am in the Mall with my dad. And still, it makes me looks cool. I know its a real funny statement to somebody like me to do, but it is. Just like few months ago when again and again, I was walking by a Shopping Mall very close to my home and a guy insisted to talk to me about modelling and stuffs and that was real odd. I told him to talk to my dad, who called me and asked me to take off the "dark shade" I was with. Only then I remembered to put back my ordinary glasses, where my  nystagmus crossing eyes are hugely augmented by its very thick lenses that pops out, but seeing the face the guy and the two accompany ladies did make, almost choked us so much we laughed. Actually I am used to this scene. Not many people likes me because the way I look... few others aside my family.  </p><p> </p><p>I also briefly remembered about a kid who asked me to be cartooned, a palsy kiddo who asked permit to draw me for some reason. We were travelling couple weeks ago, and we were in an open fair when we saw him. Of course I have permitted him, I mean "we" did permit him, as he painted  "me" alone and another paint of us together, me and my daddy. The funny thing that I remembered, is that the kid asked me how I wanted the painting and I didn't get it. My daddy told him "as you please". Only later I understood his asking. Lol. I am a bit slow. I thought I would never see that cartoon again. I'd remembered all those times I'd complained about the way I am or t he way I look, then back to the way I'd live was a wee kid. How silly and how stupid I've been.  </p><p> </p><p>For somebody who is almost + 50 with an adding over + 10 lenses at 19 yo, I am just glad to be the way I am and able to see the way I see. A week has passed since last 4th Friday. After that last Friday I will not go to any other treatment that had anything to do with surgery so frightened I was, at least for awhile. Blindness is my worst nightmare and I thought I was living my dreadest nightmare.  How long that lasted, be it couple minutes or even some seconds whatever, it doesn't matter, I'll remember it for the rest of my life. </p><p> </p><p>I am really sorry I dragged you into this messy thing I am but after this month I think I will never be the same. The sight we have is a lot better than no sight at all, thank you  all guys for your support.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Anderson out.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2011, 07:47</p><p>varifocals, </p><p>In the past 50 years, cataract surgery as gone from a high risk, life changing surgical event, requiring months of recovery, to a 15 minute outpatient surgery and the wearing of an overnight bandage on the eye and a week of wearing a protective shield at night for protection while the incision heals.  I resumed my normal activities the next day with out one lens in my glasses.  Often, you can, within reason, choose your Rx and choose the kind of IOL lens you want, mono focus or multi-focus. </p><p>When I had cataract surgery 10 years ago, multi-focus IOLs were not nearly as good as they are today and I opted for mono focus lenses with mono-vision.  I was used to wearing trifocals with a moderate minus Rx. </p><p>The mono vision plan was to get as close as possible to 0.00 in the distance eye and -1.50 in the reading eye and continue to wear trifocals with the new Rx.  IOLs only come in 0.50 increments so close is all you can hope for.  I would up with +0.25 and -1.25.  I can function quite well without my and even drive if I want to without my glasses.  It is great if I need to get up in the night to take a pill because I can do it without bothering with my glasses. </p><p>Years ago, when cataract surgery was serious business, doctors waited until the cataract was "ripe" to remove it.  By "ripe" them meant fully mature, cloudy, and often pretty hard.  Back then, they removed the entire crystalline lens and its capsule.  Today, waiting too long is counter productive and can cause unnecessary complications. </p><p>The surgery is very quick and easy on the patient.  A 3 mm incision in the side of the cornea with a diamond tipped scalpel.  Removal of a circular section of the crystalline lens capsule, emulsification of the old crystalline lens with a very tiny ultrasonic "jackhammer", removal of the emulsified lens and insertion of the IOL.  All done throughout the 3 mm incision.  Most of the time, not stitch is required and the incision closes and heals by itself. </p><p>The usually put you to sleep with some fast acting anesthesia while they do the prep.  The agent they use wears off in seconds after they stop administering it because they want you awake for the surgery itself.  When the surgery is over, you spend some time 30 minutes or so in the recovery room while the anesthesia dissipates and it is time to go home. </p><p>The next morning, I took off the bandage and waited for the antibiotic ointment the doctor has put in my eye to wash out with natural tearing action, no rubbing or solutions allowed.  I took the -4.50 lens out of my glasses and drove my self to the doctors office for a check up.  Everything was fine and he gave me instructions for the next week. </p><p>Before the surgery, I was scared and very nervous.  When the doctor asked me if I had questions after he gave me the instructions, my answer was: "when can we do the other eye".  His answer was two weeks. </p><p>One question that is often asked about IOLs was how did we learn that it was possible to put a lens inside the eye.  It was after World War II when it was discovered that some former British pilots had had pieces of their shot up acrylic plastic canopy inside their eye for years without any problems. </p><p>Most insurance requires that you acuity be 20/40 or worse before they will authorize surgery.  Dom't wait beyond that, you may regret it.  Ripe cataracts are hard to emulsify and you will loose years of superb vision by waiting unnecessarily. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guido</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2011, 07:45</p><p>I, also have the beginnings of cataracts.  Eye doc reassured me that I could have implants to correct my -5 myopia.  On further review, I came to the realization that I spent my whole life knowing that if I got close enough to something I could see it.  Would I want to try and reverse those habits?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>varifocals</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2011, 04:53</p><p>Wow. </p><p>I have found this correspondence on implants &amp; cataracts a little worrying. </p><p>Last December I was told I have the start of them &amp; a re check due in December. </p><p>I was told it is not a big deal, simply remove the old blurry stuff &amp; insert an implant. </p><p>At the moment I am a plussie &amp; as I am used to glasses would like to continue some how. </p><p>This incident seems very messy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2011, 09:55</p><p>David, </p><p>Being a low myope would have a slight effect on her final Rx.  It might slightly reduce the amount of plus in her glasses, contacts or IOLs (if she can get them).  It is all related to the length of the eyeball and the amount of plus contributed by the cornea and the humors in the eye.  The crystalline lenses contribute about 35-40% of the total +40 required to focus distant images on the retina in the typical adult eyeball. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2011, 09:31</p><p>Hey CJ </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for your response. </p><p> </p><p>As for your question I do not know the ins and outs of the surgery other than what she has told me in her own words, which was that the surgery was "a little messy and didn't quite go to plan" although I hardly think this is what the surgeon told her.  I think the plan that she is referring to is one she made up. </p><p> </p><p>It was about 3/4 weeks since the surgery was done so I am not sure if contacts / GOC has been discussed yet but I am assuming it will come up (she uses the same eye doc as I do and he's pretty thorough). </p><p> </p><p>Would the fact she was a low myope before have any major effects on the outcome?  </p><p> </p><p>If anyone has any experience of it or has any more info I would be appreciative. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2011, 08:42</p><p>David, </p><p>It is unfortunate that your friend could not get IOLs immediately as part of the cataract surgery. </p><p>It is very difficult to estimate BCVA because there are too many factors that affect it.  If she has to wear lenticular glasses, probably in the 20/30 range at best and 20/60 at worst, but I have no way to provide an accurate estimate.  It may be possible for her to wear plus contact lenses to correct the majority of the extreme hyperopia, that results when the crystalline lenses are removed, then use bi or trifocal glasses to fine tune her vision (IOW, required GOC).  That will significantly improve her peripheral vision and could get her close to 20/20 and minimize the criticality of vertex distance in high Rx glasses. </p><p>High plus glasses have the same vertex distance sensitivity issues as high minus glasses where the effective Rx changes 0.25 to 0.50 diopters per mm change in vertex distance. </p><p>Do you know if they removed the crystalline lens capsule? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2011, 06:01</p><p>Hey all, </p><p> </p><p>I have a question relating to strong glasses which I hope you guys can help clear up. </p><p> </p><p>A family friend recently came out of hospital after Cataract surgery and for whatever reason could not get IOL implants right now. </p><p> </p><p>She used to be a low myope (around -3) and now has thick lenticular plus lenses with bifocals. </p><p> </p><p>My question is this: </p><p> </p><p>What sort of BCVA would she have?  I know about the loss of peripheral vision and work around that (i.e. if i cant see her eyes she cant see me) but I want to know what she is likely to be able to see.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2011, 02:41</p><p>Hey 4eyes, you got some really good news this time; let's hope things go on improving for you. And I hope when this site comes to an end you'll keep on posting on the new one. And birthday greetings for last week!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ralph</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2011, 15:31</p><p>I have never posted but read this site all the time. I had an amazing experience at the mall today. I walked into Lenscrafters since they had a sign that said 30% off lenses. A woman in really nice wire smaller frame glasses behind the counter asked if she could help me. I asked if they could make glasses in -13 since JC Penny stops at -8. (I am -12.25 R and -12.50 L.) She said yes and told me she was -12. I then noticed her cut in and she commented that my large frame glasses would be much thinner with a higher index lense. I replied that the larger frame also gave me perifial (spelling?) vision which I really want. She replied she still had perifial vision with the smaller frame and offered to let me try her glasses on so I said yes. She removed hers and handed them to me so as I took mine off I offered her mine and she put them on probably because now she could not see. So for a short time we talked and I commented on her glasses and seeing with them while we wore each others. It was a great few minutes and great to be myopic.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2011, 13:23</p><p>Hello all you guys...here is 4eyes, back. </p><p> </p><p>My doctors visiting week matched with my birthday week, so I'm 19 yo and dislike birthdays even more, lol. But even when visiting doctors are unavoidable and painful and stuffs, from they come some amazing real, real good news. My prescription has not increased at all, not even a bit and that's something to happly celebrate as we've just learned this. In fact, even after the two surgeries I've been in, they found an interesting forming tissue like thin ciliary muscle, they're checking, that weren't there before.  Thou it didn't grow up enough to even resemble a form of a capsule, that is a very good signal to Science Community thing, they say so. I am not sure how good those news are but it's good enough to know my eyes hasn't gone worst. That's some very good news. </p><p> </p><p>I've learned over the time, that few expression means a lot. Expressions like: There were some unexpected issues or resistent muscles or whatever, or the classical "this is the best results we could get..." that yells in your ears like something  you don't want to know. </p><p> </p><p>I've got some silicone like muscles implant into both my eyes that doctors seems pleased with, but my best friend says my eyes are as "weird as they always been", the fucking asshole said. But I like his honesty, everybody else simply avoid any comment, but because I can feel myself kind of wacko and that my eyes seems as cocked as ever, I know he's telling the truth. And those are the news I didn't want to hear. I got some lateral, up and down eyes movement I had never have before and I am very thankful to them for that achievement, sometimes I got so real annoying cramps and pains I simple don't like, and it looks like they were gone fire good. Sometimes I think I can't play soccer because of them cramps and pains.  </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, doctors seems pleased with the results and says my eyes will get better over the time and that those are the best results they could get.  But the best is that I don't have to go to fire for the next months but just for ordinaries check ups. I'll have to stay home for couple days 'til Monday then I might return to my job. I just hope "it" will be there, waiting for me and not had gone up to someone else. Whatever happens, it doesn't matter but that this nightmare week is over guys, this week is just over. I hate needles... Gosh, in fact I fear. Just imagine... You know they're gonna stick one of them into your "sclera",  but you just can't move your eyes out to see them coming. You've put into drugs but they seems they are not working and the nurses keeps babbling shit into your ear to distract you. I hate them people. My daddy says I over act. Over acting? My arse. I really fear needles. Anyway... everything is over I could almost cry of contentment. Cry full of happyness... if that is the right term. Enough of me babbling too. Just no new glasses nor any helping device tools and no more doctors is cool. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Talk to you later. Thank you guys for listening me bragging. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Aberration Anderson's out. </p><p>  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus jack</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2011, 12:42</p><p>minus 5 who lugs gwgs, </p><p>The axis change, particularly at very low cylinder values, is of no consequence.  If she had another exam today by a different examiner, it would probably change again by a few degrees.  Technically, an axis change is just that.  It is not an increase or decrease.  Merely a change in the direction of the long axis of the cylinder component.  The direction of the axis is, by convention, indicated in degrees with 0 or 180 degrees horizontal and it increases in a counter clockwise direction (looking at the patient) with vertical being 90 degrees.  By convention the axis number range from 0 to 179 degrees or 1 to 180 degrees. </p><p>The sphere change of -0.75 is significant, but hopefully her myopia is slowing as she gets older. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Craig B</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2011, 09:50</p><p>Cactus J. </p><p>I am in southern Oregon, and thanks for all the information. I had not heard of the studies you mentioned but will ask my Dr next time. Your calculation of glasses vs contacts seems pretty right as I think my last glasses were around -26.5 or -27 and they need to be increased at this point.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2011, 02:10</p><p>Craig B., </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>Vertex distance is a very large factor at that level of Rx.  Normally, Vertex Distance effects and Contact lens Rx is calculated, using the square of the refracted Rx where the vertex distance of the phoropter or trial lens approximates the vertex distance of glasses.  At those levels, vertex distance effects can exceed 0.6 diopters per mm and calculated results are very inaccurate.  Often, the examiner will use contact lenses (Zero vertex distance) to get close to the Rx and do the final refraction with the final refraction with the CLs in place.  Ideally, the additional refracted Rx will be less than + or - 4.00 so vertex distance effects will be minimal and the resulting CL Rx will be very accurate, which could explain why your CL Rx is so good.   Of course, the larger image the CLs provide on the retina helps a lot also in the acuity department.  I'm guessing your glasses Rx needs to be around -28 to -30, but that is a SWAG because the formulas are only approximations at that level and not very good ones at that. </p><p>It is excellent news that you are not extremely susceptible to retinal detachment, but your Dr. is very wise to suggest exercising caution in your activities.  Hopefully, your genetics will let the rate of increase slow soon.  Several years ago, the Opthalmology Department at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland was doing some research on Nanothalmia where the eyeball failed to grow properly and the result was extreme hyperopia.  They announced the discovery of a hormone produced by the retina that appeared to control eyeball growth.  It is possible that  you could make some contributions to research into extreme myopia, if you were willing.  Has your Dr. suggested anything along those lines. </p><p>May I ask where you live? </p><p>Thanks again, </p><p>Cactus </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Craig B</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2011, 23:46</p><p>Cactus J, </p><p>My Mom was -15 or so, and some other relatives pretty nearsighted. I have a brother who is only -4, go figure! I cannot recall the exact language but my eye Dr. tells me that I am lucky because my eyes are not as vulnerable to detached retinas as most with my high Rx, but has always warned me to avoid contact sports which could include a head injury. My last contacts were -24.5, I do not have my last glasses Rx handy but it was over -25...I get my contacts updated more often than my glasses as my best vision is with contacts and I wear my glasses when I am in situations where sharp vision is not as important. My eye Dr. wants me to alternate contacts and glasses about 50/50 as he thinks that is better for my overall eye health. I really do not like to drive in glasses and made sure I had up to date contacts when I took my drivers license eye test as I am not sure if I could have passed the eye test with my glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jarred</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2011, 11:11</p><p>Hi 4eyes, My prescription is not as high as yours, but I do have over 10d base out of prism in each eye now which I'm having real trouble getting made into a pair of glasses. As a result I am being pushed towards considering surgery to reduce the amount of prism.  </p><p> </p><p>The idea of going in for ay kind of eye surgery scares the life out of me, but I do realise that the goal is to help improve things. </p><p> </p><p>When you go in to see the doctors just bear in mind that they have your best interests a heart.

<p><b>Craig B</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2011, 10:15</p><p>Anderson (4eyes), </p><p>For me going for an eye exam is both bad and good. I hate to find out how much my rx has increased, but I really like it when I get the new contacts or glasses and can see a difference for the better in how I see. Still hoping my increases will stop pretty soon. I go again pretty soon and think I will need a fairly big change, but at least no other eye problems so far. I am over -25 now and will turn 21 soon. I get good correction with contacts and okay correction with glasses (but everything is really small), and wear my glasses/contacts about 50/50 but don't like to drive in glasses. </p><p>Good luck with your new exam, let us know how you come out. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2011, 14:59</p><p>Hey Stingray.  For the most part nowdays a 1.9 hi index glass lens has been available up to about -30D for the past 10 years or so. Over that, the lens of necessity is a myodisc.  Optical 4 less will supply 1.9 hi index glass up to -25D and then they go to a myodisc lens, but I suppose when dealing with online purchases there is just too big a chance that if they try to put a patient into a higher index glass lens the patient will not like the glasses, as a lot of factors such as face shape, pupillary distance and lens shape come into play. </p><p> </p><p>At one time, from the mid 60's until the late 70's, a biconcave lens was generally used for around -12D and over.  By putting about -3D of the prescription into the front of the lens the visual field could be larger before needing to thin off the outer edges of the lens. In Europe instead of using biconcave they used a technique they called Formlenti, whereby the actual lens was ground smaller than the frame, and there was a band of no power for about a quarter inch around the frame. This looked a little strange, but it allowed them to use the frame sizes of the day for fairly high prescriptions. </p><p> </p><p>Biconcave lenses still worked up to about -18D at this time, but the front curve jumped to -6D and the optical effect was weird. For example wearing a pair of high minus glasses with a -6D base curve and walking down a long corridor made you feel like you were walking down a tunnel.  Light standards seemed to curve, and straight lines were not straight, unless you looked right through the middle of the lens. </p><p> </p><p>Most people at this time would rather go for the myodisc, because it could be made with a flat front, and while the reduced visual field was a bit of a problem, that was easier to adapt to than the biconcave effect. </p><p> </p><p>In the early to mid 80's a blended myodisc called a superlenti lens came out. This lens was developed by Zeis in Germany, and quickly became the lens of choice for high minus patients who wanted to attempt to conceal their lens thickness.  But by the 90's hi index lenses were starting to improve their abbe value and the superlenti or blended myodisc went out of favour.  I still have a pair of men's superlenti glasses with a prescription of -6.75 in one eye and 9.75 in the other that I bought back in the 80's, and the highest prescription pair I have is a pair of superlenti's in 1.9 index glass with a prescription of -46D and -44D. </p><p> </p><p>I have been wondering lately what the next step in lens development will be, since the styes seem to be going to larger frames, and even with hi index lenses a strong minus lens will look pretty strong and thick in some of the new frames.  Personally i liked the smaller frames of the mid 90's and through most of the 2000's, because the size of the frames meant for thinner lenses, which brought a lot of contact lens wearers back into the market for glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yoyo</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2011, 10:26</p><p>I think these days myodiscs are less necessary because of all the high-index options available to thin out the lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2011, 10:13</p><p>With the exception of this website, I recall only having seen maybe 2-3 people in my life with myodisc eyeglasses.  My question is:  Do people who require these lenses due to high myopic prescriptions have an alternative?  So for example if you needed a correction of say -18.00 or higher, could you just get regular glasses or do you not have a choice in the matter?  I see references to biconcave lenses.  What are those?  Are they the alternative to myodiscs?   If so, how thick are those lenses as compared to the myodiscs?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eyestein</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2011, 03:05</p><p>Hi minus 5 who luvs gwgs  </p><p> </p><p>Did anyone guess the Rx correctlly? I thought possibly no more than -12.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>I, Glasses</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2011, 15:33</p><p>All4Eyes, </p><p> </p><p>The title of Stephen King's book is 'On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft.'  It is a very good book, even if a reader is not optically obsessive.  Roughly the first half is autobiographical, and the second half explains King's approach to creative writing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2011, 17:51</p><p>And, </p><p>If you follow the procedure for calculating the CL Rx from a glasses Rx of -8.00 you get -7.25 contacts.  However, many manufacturers on;y offer -0.50 increments above -7.00.  The choice would be either -7.00 or -7.50 and your gf would probably find the -7.50s to be the best choice because they would give the sharpest vision. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2011, 12:05</p><p>I think my gf has -8 in her glasses and wears -7.50 disposable contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2011, 04:25</p><p>Blake, </p><p>I apologize for not making the explanation clear.  It was an excellent question that requires a bit of math to explain.  Vertex distance effects confuse a lot of people. </p><p>Most formulas associated with optics are straight forward add, subtract, multiply, and divide, but vertex distance effects get into algebra and involve squaring the Rx.  Here are some approximate examples.  Rx below about -4.00 will have pretty much the same Rx in contacts and glasses.  -9.00 glasses Rx will need -8.00 contacts, -16 glasses will need -13 contacts, -20 glasses need around -15 contacts. </p><p>The procedure I described in the previous post work pretty well going from a glasses Rx to a contact lens Rx, but it is not super accurate as the Rx gets higher. Estimating a glasses Rx from a contact lens is more difficult and even less accurate, but if your gf's contact lens Rx is -8.00 and -7.50, she would need glasses in the -9.00 and -8.50 range to give the same clarity of vision.  With higher Rx, most Eye Care Professionals will estimate a contact lens Rx using the glasses Rx as a starting point and let the patient try several Rx either side of the estimate and let the patient choose the one they like best. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Blake</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2011, 23:57</p><p>Thanks cactus jack, a little bit hi tech for me at this stage but from what I can gather contact lenses if anything will have a slightly lower rx than the glasses if different at all</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2011, 23:33</p><p>I, Glasses: Do you happen to recall the title of the book where Stephen King talks about his glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2011, 05:21</p><p>Blake, </p><p>There can be a difference.  Usually, if there is a difference, it is caused by the Vertex Distance effects.  Vertex Distance is the distance between the front surface of the cornea and the back surface of the lens.  The Vertex Distance for contact lenses is 0.  The Vertex Distance for glasses is about 12 mm. </p><p>Vertex Distance effects are a mathematical square function of the refracted Rx.  Typically, Phoropters or Trial Lens frames have about the same Vertex Distance as glasses and no adjustment is necessary except in very high Rx.  However, if the refracted Rx is more than + or - about 4.00 some adjustment of the contact lens Rx may be necessary.  The direction of the adjustment is determined by the sign on the Rx.  If the refracted Rx is a -, the contact lens Rx will be lower than the refracted Rx.  If the refracted Rx is a +, the contact lens Rx will be higher than the refracted Rx.  The exact amount of the difference can be calculated pretty easily. </p><p>Here is the formula and procedure.  Sphere and cylinder are calculated separately. </p><p>1. Square the Rx.  e.g. -6 x -6 = 36 </p><p>2. Divide by 1000. e.g.  36/1000 = 0.036 </p><p>3. Multiply by the Vertex Distance (in mm).  e.g. 0.036 x 12 = 0.432 diopters </p><p>4. Reduce the refracted Rx by 0.432.  -6.00 reduced by 0.432 = -5.568 </p><p>Contact lenses in the -6 range are available in 0.25 diopter increments.  The obvious choice is -5.50, but most myopes would find -5.75 contacts provided sharper vision. </p><p>Experiment with different refracted Rx and notice how the Vertex Distance effects become almost negligible below + or -4.00 and become very large at high Rx. </p><p>Sometimes, there can be a difference between glasses and contact lens Rx when the sphere and cylinder powers are combined to avoid using toric contact lenses.  It is usually done on Rx with fairly low cylinders. </p><p>In that case, after the CL Rx has been adjusted for Vertex Distance, 1/2 of the cylinder is added to the sphere Rx and sphere only contacts are prescribed. </p><p>For Example.  If the glasses Rx was -6.00, -1.00 x 56 that Rx could be made exactly in glasses.  The sphere only CL Rx would be -6.25.  -5.75 + (-0.50) = -6.25.  Most Eye Care Professionals stock trial contact lenses in a large range of sphere values and will let the patient try several different Rx to see which they like the best. </p><p>Hope this explanation helps. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Blake</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2011, 21:41</p><p>This may be a stupid question but I am relatively new to learning about glasses and vision, but is there usually a difference between glasses rx and contact rx or are they the same?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2011, 17:10</p><p>Also, vertex distance can seriously affect the glasses Rx.  Reading without glasses at 3 inches would be very close to the contact lens Rx.  If the CL Rx is -13, the glasses Rx would be around -16 assuming a 12 mm Vertex Distance. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2011, 17:05</p><p>-5, </p><p>About -13 assuming no astigmatism, but at that Rx, accuracy of measurement is very critical and a little error can make a big difference in Rx. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;10 Jul 2011, 13:44</p><p>Vision treat </p><p> </p><p>Hello Astra. Ola Cactus Jack. Hi you all guys.  </p><p> </p><p>Here is 4eyes or Anderson and I've been posting for awhile about the RX of the eyeglasses of mine and about people saying they're strong  and all, thou I hate that term. I'd rather use the fairly for the +47,5 and the +49,25 already adding the + 11,5 bifocals DP, considering the amount of 40 BO of prism DP being those for the far distance as I have about 25Â° BO prism for close work and that I am a "visually impaired" kid even when I am already a 18 years old guy, whatever. As far as I do understand I am glasses corrected for visual mobility only, but to everybody amazes I can do play soccer or do about anything I want, thank you.  </p><p> </p><p>Maybe I'm saying something stupid, but according to my best friend who's an amazing soccer player that happens to stammer real bad and is completely nuts about it but not about crossing eyes and I trust him and try to be just cool as he's, I don't not see even the half distance he sees. I understand I'm corrected to see  as far as about 8/9 meters distance, farther distance means I'll no person nor nothing recognize nor even see but forms and colors only. I learned that I can not even recognize my best friends features if I am bare eyed, even if they stick their face right at a half a meter in front of me, but I think that's exaggeration, really.  I have no peripheral vision at all, even if my father sits beside me I would not see him unless I do look straight at him, whatever. I am still striving to comprehend the way I perceive the world with some real and pacience friends, who share experiences with me. I understand I have funny looking eyes that crosses badly and that they moves in funny and dummy ways, so that I look weirdo and ugly and disgusting but considering seeing 20/60 or 20/80 doesn't makes me repulsive our whatever, so I went and will go bare eyed everywhere I want and when I want. I only have to take care not to step on anything or "anybody"on my way to the shore our anywhere. I am saying this because some old and snobbish people complained about me and my friend being an danger and bad type reputation for their hotel.  So that we should be on "shades" our whatever if we would like to. I just ignored those clerks and off we gotten.  </p><p> </p><p>As I'd have the funny nap everybody does have here, we both, me and my friend went to a private shore by the hotel we're staying here in Mallorca or Majorca island, some of the hosts complained about our appearance. Lol. I found that so stupid and unbelievable we both leave the hotel laughing. But I am still thinking about it and I am a bit mad about some snobbish that might be feel hurt about my presence. I still think I am free to go whatever I want. </p><p> </p><p>Anderson, the aberration's out.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;09 Jul 2011, 13:11</p><p>You are in a fantastic part of the world :) Mallorca is just amazing. I owned a flat there for many years. Superb swimming. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;09 Jul 2011, 12:41</p><p> </p><p>Hi you guys my friends from this nice place.  </p><p> </p><p>As July comes near, a phobia of hearing any hospital or doctors names  I know arises and knock me out any interest of leaving home. </p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly enough, I am traveling but not to Moorefield Hospital nor I am going to L.A. UCLA Hospital, but I am in a nice Spanish place, Mallorca islands with couple friends and one of them is speech impaired. The greatest thing about going to foreign places is that nobody knows or cares about you and I spend the morning bare eyed in a shore close to the hotel doing absolutely nothing but swimming  and sun burning myself and swimming again. Somehow I could feel people, mostly kids voices commenting on me and my friend who also stammer badly.  </p><p> </p><p>Being able to see nothing at all but colors and shadows only, never felt so comfortable in my whole live, but somehow I felt uncomfortably in someway. I don't get it. It kind off makes no sense. My daddy's in Middle East and we're all by ourselves so why did I felt that way?  </p><p> </p><p>After a nap post lunching, we returned to play on the beach, and I hatred all those stares I was getting so I returned my eyeglasses to the hotel. I'd rather go crossing eyed out. My new eyeglasses is reaching the limits of the + 50 and over 40Â° DP BO from those good Germany BL guys ever could made in a such acceptable fitness, so after a lengthy hours of use out starts getting into my nerves.  </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, the feeling of comfort being bare eyed still longs me so, so much I'll do the same tomorrow. It's just that that I wanted to share with you guys. Have ever anybody else felt the same? </p><p> </p><p>Anderson's  "aberrations" out. Lol. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2011, 13:55</p><p>Astra </p><p>I am sorry I didn't see your comments until now. I am sure it is me but I am not sure I understand what you are saying in regards to the pricings? I am in the USA and for example Zenni" is in the USA as well however I know they are only a middleman and the glasses come from Hong Kong. I have ordered many hundreds of pairs of glasses from them and a few other on-line retailers as well. I have shown them to many of the big chain optical stores and they have told me that the frame, lenses and even the AR coating is as good as theirs. In one case a certain chain even had the exact same frame on their wall board. The difference was that with lenses and AR coating theirs was around $225.00 compared to $15.00 from zenni. But my question is and i'm sorry I didn't understand your answer but why is it if someone goes to Hong Kong the prices seem to be much more than $15.00. It would seem that by cutting out a middleman the price would be still cheaper. </p><p>By the way I don't know what country your in but here in the USA most all the frames in all the stores now come from Kong Kong so not sure the quality is any different based on that. Of course if you ask the retailer at a local chain vision store they will try and tell you that the quality is much less from a on-line seller.  </p><p>One friend that works at a nationwide chain vision store who has purchased several pairs from zenni and also has 3 pairs from her store told me that when she is not at work she wears her zenni glasses all the time because they are more comfortable than her expensive designer glasses she got free to wear at work. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 May 2011, 13:34</p><p>varifocals, </p><p>It depends on where you live.  Typically, in the US and Europe you can get Over-the-counter (OTC) readers because so many older people need them.  In some (mostly asian) countries where myopia is extremely common, you can get OTC glasses for myopia.  To some extent, it is dependent on the regulatory environment. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>varifocals.</b>&nbsp;15 May 2011, 13:15</p><p>why is it that you can get emergency readers from stores but not myopic ones?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Val</b>&nbsp;15 May 2011, 07:59</p><p>Astigmafan, my own experience is like that:  when I was about 16 years old, I found near a bush a pair of child glasses, that turned up to have a lot of cylinder correction. Probably the glasses had fallen off and the little child could not find them because he couldn't see.  I was with some friends and we all tried the glasses and no one could see through them. We tried to see how things looked through the lenses at different distances (not wearing the glasses). At 10 cm (4 inches) a circle became very oval on the horizontal axis. Actually, I think that the lenses had almost no sphere correction, only cylinder, because they did not magnify or minify things, only distort. </p><p>We tried to find the owner of the glasses, but we could not find him/her. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>r</b>&nbsp;14 May 2011, 19:22</p><p>The effect of circles looking more like ovals is due the the effects of magnification/magnification from the lenses being different powers when the axis is 90 degrees different that comes from the vertex distance. You would have.a smaller image with a power of -6 than you would at, for instance, -2, given the same distance from the cornea.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;14 May 2011, 15:07</p><p>It is worth thinking about circles with astigmatism. If it uncorrected, then the circle will look like an oval (or ellipse, or squashed circle) with the direction of the more "pointy" ends revealing the axis, and the amount of "Squashed-up-ness" proportional to strength (it will be blurred too in places, where the distortion from circular is greatest). The correct astigmatic lens will correct this and restore the circle to apparent roundness. </p><p> </p><p>A corrective lens of right strength but wrong angle will do an increasingly bad job of restoring the circle as the angle deviates from what it should be. Eventually there comes a point where the lens does more bad than good in terms of providing an undistorted image - it adds to the total astigmatism, rather than reducing it. That's where the headaches start. The circle is not just oval, it is kind of lumpy. </p><p> </p><p>With the right angle, wrong strength again the circle distorts to an oval, but not so distorted as above. Obviously with both wrong, the problems escalate. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;14 May 2011, 12:14</p><p>Astigmafan, </p><p>Incorrect cylinder causes distortion of the image.  The amount of the distortion is related to the cylinder power and the type of distortion is related to the axis. As an example, if the axis is horizontal (0), squares look like fat, squat rectangles and circle are American football shape.  If the axis is vertical (90) squares look tall and thin.  If the axis is between horizontal and vertical squares look like parallelograms. </p><p>Wearing glasses with incorrect cylinder and axis are almost guaranteed to give you headaches. </p><p>Base Out prism is usually prescribed to correct crossed eyes.  You can actually wear quite a bit of BO prism because it has the same effect as converging to focus on something close, which you do every day.  The effect would be that your eyes would have to converge to fuse distant objects and converge more to read. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astigmafan</b>&nbsp;14 May 2011, 11:09</p><p>Something that I have always had a curiosity about.  What would it be like if I don't have astigmatism and go somewhere like Zenni Optical and order a really whacked out high cylinder or axis or whatever it is to correct astigmatism.  What would the lenses be like when I put them on?  What about glasses that are prescribed to correct crossed eyes?   </p><p> </p><p>Would they pull my vision into a major distortion even it is was the same prescription as my own?</p><p></p><hr>

She told me she was long sighted +19.5 &amp; changed into contacts as she thought she would look better. She said her contacts were not as strong as her glasses. &amp; following a check on the train notices she could hardly see them. She asked me honestly how she looked? I said your grey / hazel eyes look glassy &amp; vacant. Fine she said I should have kept my glasses on then. What a conversation. I nervously asked if she would put her glasses back on so I could form a judgement. Well! she said. Lovely I told her as her frames were really nice, suited her &amp; went well with her hair. She let me try on her glasses &amp; bearing in mind I am aplussie (+4.50 add +3) the seat opposite was just a huge blue blur.I wore her glasses twice, once for a few minutes.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;19 Apr 2011, 18:01</p><p>varifocals, </p><p>Remember to experience what a high myope sees with out their glasses you need to try a high plus lens.  To experience what a high hyperope sees without their glasses you need a high minus lens,  it is more accurate if you wear contacts, but it is not exact because often there are retinal problems to go along with their high myopia or hyperopia that can affect Visual Acuity. </p><p>GOC can be pretty realistic if the combo is right, but it does not simulate retinal or muscle problems. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rudy</b>&nbsp;19 Apr 2011, 13:50</p><p>Varifocals, you are very right.  The accident happened on the way to the hotel.  For the next 4 days, I literally had to be led around, I was blind.  Could not register at the hotel, could not see food in the buffet, or on my plate.  Julie &amp; I both use wheelchairs, and I had to follow the vague shadow that was her when we went anywhere. </p><p>When the glasses finally arrived, being CR39, the field of view was considerably smaller than I am used to.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2011, 20:48</p><p>spec4ever I honestly have not had all the problems you said with using the selection area on the left side where you can narrow down what you are looking for by price range, plastic or metal, male, female or unisex all have worked fine for me. As I mentioned the only issues I have is that I would like to see all the color options shown together next to each other.  An example of this is frame #339115 it comes in 4 different colors but they are spread out all over the place. </p><p>Chino the only reason I can give for them being difficult with putting thick lenses in certain frames is because they have a return policy and most of the people that are ordering glasses are not nearly as savy as most of us are. They see these requests and figure the person ordering doesn't know that the glasses will be very thick or by their standards unattractive. I have found that the "comments" box works in many cases or try calling them and let them know you understand the lenses will be thick. Look at it this way we here at "eyescene" are a very small part of the glasses wearing population, they don't know we know what we are asking for. </p><p>I totally agree that if you don't mind spending a few dollars more for what you want that certainly is a good option.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2011, 18:41</p><p>I've had similar problems specs4ever. </p><p> </p><p>I tried to induce for years with no success, using glasses in the -8D range.  Rimless are my favorite, but zenni wouldn't put those -8 lenses in rimless frames because they were "too strong."  Optical4less never had a problem with it. </p><p> </p><p>I'm myopic, with an rx of -5.5.  I want to experiment with different + glasses to see how I manage walking around with more blur.  I recently ordered two pairs of glasses, one with an rx of +6.5, and another one with an rx of +12.  They had no issue with the +6.5, but they said to choose another frame because the +12s were too strong.  Given the issues I've had with them in the past, I made sure both glasses were full-rim frames and really didn't understand what their problem was. </p><p> </p><p>They recommended an ugly frame with a 48mm lens width.  I did some more searching and found an attractive frame with 49mm lenses.  They insisted that I stick with the 48mm lens width.  I was like, "are you serious?  Over 1mm?"  At this point, they were trying my patience.  They mentioned something about the lens strength again, which made me question their competency.  I patiently informed the person that + lenses are thickest in the center, and that larger lens width values would not make the edges any thicker. </p><p> </p><p>Like you, I have a good computer.  Despite that, I have the same issues you do with their page resetting itself or the filter simply not working at all.  It's finicky and slow on top of it.  I managed to pull it off by using two web browsers simultaneously.  The filter worked just fine with Internet Explorer, but the website was even slower to load.  I would then use firefox to look up specific specs on frames that interested me. </p><p> </p><p>I wound up wasting much of my precious time for what should have been a straightforward purchase.  I mean, if they're going to nit-pick rxs, they really need to add that to the filter as well. </p><p> </p><p>I ultimately want to have IOLs implanted to induce higher amounts of myopia.  I'm going to do GOC to determine how high of an rx I can have while still being able to see 20/40.  I'd like my final rx to be somewhere in the -26D to -33D range.  When that happens, I'll buy my frames at zenni, but have the lenses made and installed by optical4less.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2011, 17:46</p><p>The biggest problem I have is that I spend hours with people selecting a frame, and then they tell me that the prescription won't work in that frame. So then I ahve to go through the process all over again, only to find out that they won't use that frame either. The last 2 orders I have placed have resulted in my having to ask for my money back on at least 1 pair. </p><p>But my biggest trouble is with their website. I have cable internet with a fast connection.  My computer is a core 2 duo 3.0 with a graphics card and I am running 64 bit Win 7 with 4gb of ram.  This is more than the average user has, although it is no longer super fast like it was 2 years ago. </p><p>When I click on the website it takes a long tme to load.  Once it loads I either have to identify what I am looking for, or I have to go through a selection of over 2000 pairs at 80 pairs a page. But when I try to use the slider on the price bar it either doesn't work, or if it does, it then needs to reload the page before I can do the pd. Then it reloads the page for the pd. Then it reloads the page for the sex, and then again for the shape, and then again for if you want full rim or half rim, then again for the type such as plastic or wire. And half the time somewhere along making the choices it resets itself back to the beginning. But sometimes it works, so I go to select 80 pairs per page. I get 80 pairs on the first page. then when I click to move to page 2 it resets itself back to the home page and I have to go throught the whole game over again.  And sometimes, like today, when I have the frame number and I try to input it in the search it comes up with an error message saying that the frame can't be found. </p><p>I can't believe that I am the only one having this problem. I suspect that their website is just to busy for the traffic it can handle.  But, I have wasted enough time on them for now, and will take my business somewhere else.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2011, 16:34</p><p>I suspect Zenni's business model is based on cutting low cost, readily available stock lenses, and fitting them in low cost frames.

The temples can always be adjusted to a proper size to fit behind the ear. But there is little you can do if they are too wide or too narrow to fit your face. Now when you place an order with "Zenni" they send a small plastic ruler that is very handy to be used to measure your "PD" It works very well and you can use it on yourself by looking into a mirror. </p><p>Also I have ordered many, many pairs of glasses and have found that it is not really necessary to get any of the high index lens options if your rx is not more than around -4.50.

<p><b>Dee</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2011, 20:53</p><p>Glasses with Zenni are not that expensive. 1.61 Hi index lenses cost me, I think $20 extra so I can get a nice pair of glasses for about $40 to $45 including paying extra for my strong prescription. Without high index lenses (1.57?) I can buy glasses for between $20 and $25. You need your pupil distance (PD) but your eye doc should measure it for you. They have this neat thingie that looks like binoculars. They put it over your eyes, push a button, and you have your PD. It is a number and I think it is in milimeters and mine is 62. You also need your temple length and if it's not already on your temples, your eye doc can tell you that also. Mine is 140. Good luck.</p><p></p><hr>

I HAVE to turn my head to look left or right, rather than glancing though the sides of my glasses, otherwise it is just one big blur. I've been caught out crossing the roads a few times with that. I should know better.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Laura</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2011, 08:02</p><p>Dee. </p><p> </p><p>Yeah I agree, High Index are a great improvement on coke bottle lenses like I was given at 15. God how I hated wearing them. Contacts were my saviour at the time. Like you though I'm back to glasses pretty well all the time now cos of various vision probs I won't go into here. I just wish I could afford all the pairs you treat yourself to. I'd love to do the same.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cassy</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2011, 07:06</p><p>Wish I had enough pairs with the right presecription to pick and choose. What's your prescription Melyssa? Is it stable?

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2011, 06:35</p><p>Dee, </p><p> </p><p>Whereas you pick glasses to go with your outfit, I generally pick my outfit to go with whichever 5-6 pairs of glasses I'll be wearing on a particular day.

<p><b>OttO</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2011, 11:57</p><p>Cactus, </p><p> </p><p>Interesting comments about tinting glasses.  I've noticed that lately on talking heads with glasses on some of the TV news programs, and wondered about it.  The same effect can be seen on the first link in the "guys in glasses" posting by James today at 10:05. Click on the frontal photo.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Laura</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2011, 08:35</p><p>Cassy. </p><p> </p><p>Hi. Yes I do wear contacts occasionally. I started with them when I was 15 at school because with standard plastic lenses my glasses were like coke bottles! I really hated them. So I begged my parents to let me try contacts. When I got them I wore them at school every day for over two years, going back to glasses as soon as I got home at tea time. Between 17 and 18 I got some new stronger glasses with High Index lenses and I was so pleased how nice they looked I started wearing glasses more or less full-time again. I only had one last term to go at school, which helped a lot. Now i wear glasses for work all the time and usually at home, I just put my contacts in for fun when I go out and stuff, and even then I sometimes wear my glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2011, 08:28</p><p>Cassy, </p><p>It probably does not matter regarding eye color, but a very light gray of less than 5% would be the least noticeable or perhaps a very light rose.  Be sure and ask if they can change the tint or eliminate it if you don't like it, before you let them do anything.  Remember, its purpose is not cosmetic, but if you want it for that, choose the color and amount of tint to suit your purposes and it will still have much greater effect on the light from the side. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cassy</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2011, 01:51</p><p>Cactus Jack, does it matter which kind of tint I ask for? I have brown eyes? </p><p> </p><p>Laura and Dee, do you wear contacts for anything or just wear glasses all the time? </p><p> </p><p>Cassy</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2011, 12:50</p><p>Cassy, </p><p>There can be some "interesting" internal reflections from light entering minus lenses through the edge.  You can significantly minimize the effects of internal reflections by a very small amount of tint in the clear glasses. The small amount of tint will probably be almost unnoticeable to you or others, but because the light entering from the side has more distance to travel inside the lens, it will be affected much more that light coming straight through the lens. </p><p>I suspect your friend was commenting more on the frames than the lenses.  You might ask for suggestions on "improvement". </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2011, 11:27</p><p>Cassy, the only difference I've heard from one person who had semi rimless frames with polished edges and is -13.75 is that the sun, or beams of light can reflect of the edge of your lenses quite easily and be a distraction. </p><p> </p><p>The choice is really up to you; I like both and only decide which to have once I have chosen the frame and know how thick the lenses will be.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cassy</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2011, 10:14</p><p>Thanks Cactus Jack. Both have the same kind of lens. 1.67 if I recall correctly. Both seem to have the same edge, which I assume is frosted. So I guess the difference is lens thickness. Is there any disadvantage to having polished edges? Steven, I actually wear the bottle glasss ones mostly, but that's because they are clear and the others are dark. I'm used to having really strong glasses and I'm only 17 so I'll probably need stronger ones yet, but I was taken aback by my best friend who politely said that my new glasses with clear lenses "don't do anything for you". </p><p> </p><p>Cassy</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Steven</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2011, 01:17</p><p>I had the same question as Casey did, I own two pair of glasses too, one that definetely has the coke bottle look, and another one that even though it still looks strong, is not half as bad as the first one.  </p><p>Which ones do you usually wear Casey?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Steven</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2011, 01:16</p><p>Dee, was it difficult adjusting to wear just glasses specially with such a high prescription as yours? I might be looking at the need of stop wearing contacts for at least considerable period of time, my rx is similar to yours...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2011, 17:28</p><p>Cassy, </p><p>There are several things that can affect the appearance and edge thickness of minus lenses.  The power of the lens, the Index of the lens material, and the size affect the lens edge thickness.   </p><p>The so called "power rings" are actually internal reflections of the edges of the lens as seen from the front.  The intensity and number of the power rings are affected by the character of the edge - frosted or polished and the power and edge thickness of the lenses. </p><p>I suspect the "bottle glass" lenses are low index CR-39 with frosted edges and the OK lenses are probably higher index with perhaps polished edges. </p><p>There is no way to actually tell without seeing the lenses. The CR-39 glasses probably have better optical properties even though they are the least attractive and least expensive. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mrs H</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2011, 06:07</p><p>A few days ago, a former student of mine visited me at the university where I teach.  I recognized her right away, as she was wearing light-blue eyeglasses with very large frames and rather thick lenses, the same eyeglasses I complimented her on when she first wore them back when she was a student.  After a short time she took another pair out of her pocketbook, a gold cateye frame, and put them on.  She reminded me that those were the last eyeglasses she wore in class, during the final, as well as the first class that semester.  Then she took out a pair that was even bigger than the first pair, a dark blue frame with the temples on the bottom.  I had never seen these eyeglasses before.  She told me that the day she got them, she put them on and drove right here for a reunion party, and that she was the hit of the party as everyone wanted to know about her frames.  I told her they looked nice and she wore them while we caught up on old times (and new ones).  Before leaving, she put on her light-blue frames once more.  </p><p></p><hr>

As I have mentioned I am considering looking for a job soon in the optical field. I know I would be tempted when someone came to tell them they can save a bunch by going to Zenni or some of the other on-line places. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2011, 14:48</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p> </p><p>I can just imagine if I were working in that fancy optical place, wearing a black-and-white dress to go with my big black &amp; clear drop-temples that I have on now (#2775 from bleudame.com, currently available only in brown &amp; clear) -- and trying to tell the myriad of customers where I got the frame.  :) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2011, 10:56</p><p>Amy </p><p>You should have Laura ask what kind of discount family members get at her store? Not sure how it is in the UK but here in the states most optical stores will sell glasses at cost, which is about 1/3 of what the regular customer pays. You can still get your eye exam at your regular family doctor and just have him/her write the scrip for you and then you are free to shop where you please.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amy</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2011, 08:44</p><p>Soundmanpt. </p><p> </p><p>Yeah no worries. I'm for ever popping in to see Laura to see what new frames they've just got in. It's ridiculous really, but I really love trying them on. I dunno why but I look in all the high street optical stores and do the same. I must be weird or something. Hope no one minds.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2011, 07:02</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>That "pricey place" with the 6 locations sounds like a place I would work well in, and I'm certain they would love me wearing several different pairs of glasses a day, and that I just about always wear a nice blouse, skirt, and jacket at work -- or dresses in warmer weather.  Heels, though, are not so easy on the kneesies anymore.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2011, 11:06</p><p>Melyssa </p><p>You would find it different here in the mid-west. for example we have 2 local chains, one has 27 locations and the other 42 in the surrounding areas. Both have a policy about the employees wearing glasses while on duty. Sometimes they do get a little lax about it, but that only lasts until the regional or district manager notices some not wearing glasses. One store that has about 6 locations and is very pricey glasses are considered a part of their work clothes. They get new glasses every 6 months there. The men must wear coat and tie and the women wear very nice dresses or skirts with heels, makeup is a must. Og course the JC Peeny's and Wal-Mart don't have the same rules or guidelines. </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2011, 10:47</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>It would be a miracle if even 5% of the salespeople at the various optical places I've been to over the decades have worn glasses -- at least outside the two places that were owned and run by rather old men, who did know the business quite well.  I probably can count on one hand the number of young women who have worn glasses at any of the stores, which of course meant that I had to try to see from two inches away how a frame looked, or to have them model the frame for me.  And I still get a chuckle out of the handsome young man who, when I asked him to adjust a drop-temple frame of mine, had no clue that the style even existed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2011, 10:39</p><p>Amy </p><p>Yes Laura told me that the three of you all go to the same eye doctor and have been going there for years. In her case I suggested that she still go get her exam from her personal doctor and also allow the doctor where she works do an exam for her as it wont cost anything. It never hurts to get a second check. But when she picks out her glasses she should use the rx from her regular doctor. For you and your mum of course go to your own eye doctor and be examined, but maybe instead of buying your glasses from there Laura likely can give family a huge discount on glasses. So all you need do is ask for a copy of your rx to shop at Specsavers. Laura of course will be getting hers at no cost. Most all optical stores give employees free glasses so they can model them as well as sell them. In many cases optical stores require their employees wear glasses when on the job. Some of the more up scale stores even require and supply new glasses every 6 months for fashion sake. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amy</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2011, 04:39</p><p>Soundmapt. </p><p> </p><p>Well I may try where she works, but usually me and Laura and my Mum all go to the same optician we've always gone to. Specsavers have only just recently opened a branch where we live and Laura happened to see a notice on the door advertising for Optical Assistants. It was at our normal optician where I heard the receptionist call Laura's glasses the ones with the High Minus Lenses. I suppose they didn't relise i was listening or they might not have refered to them as that </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2011, 11:02</p><p>Amy </p><p>Sounds like your big sister, Laura, is teaching you well about prescriptions? When you get your next glasses will they be from where she works?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amy</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2011, 05:01</p><p>Rayray. </p><p> </p><p>I once had to call in at our opticians to collect some spare glasses for my older sister that had been re-fitted with her new prescription. While I was waiting I over heard the receptionist say to the other assistant Amy has called for the glasses with the High Minus Lenses for her sister Laura. Do you know if they have come back from the lab? I didn't dared tell Laura what I had overheard when I got back home and gave them to her.  Her prescription then was RE-9.00 and LE-8.75 </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Highmyope</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2011, 02:12</p><p>Dee, possibly. I believe it depends on the course of your progression. Benign progressive myopia usually halts by age 30. I don't think degenerative myopia has a common endpoint.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rayray</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2011, 23:39</p><p>From reading the definitions on various medical sites online there are different definitions and no hard and fast rules. If your eyes have stopped getting worse it is likely you dont have malignant or severely degenerative myopia which is pretty rare but ends with prescriptions over -20 and often visual impairment. Nearly every site/medical dictionary says that over -6 is high myopia and as I guess -13 is more than twice that it is 'extreme' - I tend to find that optometrists try to be polite when discussing your vision with you - i'm about -8.50 and no optometrist has ever said I have high myopia or very poor eyesight. The dispensing opticians or assistants tend to be a lot more blunt - I've been told I have an extreme prescription, thick lenses etc. one girl once said to 'i know you wearing contacts or you'd never have found your way here, you are so shortsighted, poor love'. Many people would have found it a bit rude, but me being me I enjoyed it lol.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dee</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2011, 19:15</p><p>Highmyope </p><p>At -13 does this mean I am or have benign progressive myopia? I had never heard that description before. My eye doc always called me a just a "high myope" although from what I have read, I am an "extreme myope". </p><p></p><hr>

If you are sure that is what you want, you should at least try. You really have nothing to loose by trying if you in fact want to be myopic. Once again I urge caution when starting this. Do not go too strong at first. If you currently have perfect vision I would say no more than a -.75 or -1.00 to start with. The good thing is that even if your actual vision doesn't change you should be able to wear these glasses as much as wish. </p><p>You may want to go over to "Induced Myopia" thread and read many of the past comments.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Highmyope</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2011, 09:52</p><p>Re: myopic progression. There are several forms of myopia. Standard myopia normally stops progressing by the early 20s and rarely goes beyond -6.

I didn't want glasses at the time as it was the beginning of my last year in high school.  Vanity of course. I'm sure my vision must have been no worse than 20/40 or he would have prescribed.

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2011, 15:55</p><p>Laura, </p><p> </p><p>No matter what is said, there is no sure age pattern for vision progression. A doc determined that I was slightly nearsighted at age 17 but left me non-prescribed.  At 19 he put me in glasses but the difference seemed so little that I only used them sometimes to drive, mostly at night. In my late 20s, my prescription increased enough that I needed to wear glasses for all distance activities and at that point failed the vision test for driving. I returned to college full time at age 30 and suddenly could not function without glasses full time, either.  It was impossible to see whiteboards and overheads and beyond inconvenient to see faces, room numbers, and signs, etc. I slowly progressed a quarter diopter here and there and got my strongest script at age 50, -3.25 in both eyes with astigmatism. I know that doesnât sound like a lot compared to you but it was too much to function without glasses most of the time. I credit my continued progression to working in front of computer screens all day, but who really knows?  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2011, 06:41</p><p>No ophthalmologist ever told me my vision would stabilize at 20, 80, or any other number.  My prescription kept going up, up, and away at my biennial exams until I was 36, and then at 48 I had my first add.</p><p></p><hr>

You're absolutely right.  </p><p>My eyeglasses are specially made in Germany or otherwise I'd have to wear those "Low vision tools". ARRGGG...  </p><p>I don't know what angle you are talking about, all I know is that I use my right eye to see things to my left side and I use my left eye to see things to my right side as both my eyes can hardly reach midline. I can use both eyes to see ahead of me with minimal head turn thanks my eyeglasses prism. I like to trick people by faking I am not "staring"  them because of this "crossing eyes" thing as this is impolite, because I turn my head away to left or to right to see better. Well, if that is what you are asking 'bout angle, that is it. </p><p> </p><p>The only time I don't have my glasses on is when I am home "and" when my daddy is not around. He is too annoying about me having or not my glasses on among others things. </p><p>I can not say too much about how I see, as this same questions seems too vague or because I'm still trying to understand the way I've adapted to my sight. It is enough to say I really admire the way people do two or three things at the same time they are walking. I really can not understand that. </p><p> </p><p>Anderson.

As well as the question asked by the previous poster, I wonder whether the big difference in Rx between you right and left eye (over 10 dioptres) causes you problems.  Do you get binocular vision?  I think there must be quite a difference in the amount of magnification between the two lenses. </p><p>Do you normally wear bifocals?

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2011, 04:30</p><p>Hi everybody... </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>IÂ´m sorry if I do annoy anybody but I can't set apart talking about weather and myself as the weather do somehow affects dramatically the way I see things if it rains... or snows as in England, I mean. When it is raining hard I can't see a darn thing no matter what I do. If I take off my eyeglasses I see nothing but a huge madly dancing blur, but if I keep them on I see a huge blur too, with water on lenses. That OR my daddy who drives me real crazy treating me like a little kid.  </p><p>Now, during Summer the weather changes brusquely from sun to rain within an hour and so changes my daddy, who wants to take me out of the team as if I am made of sugar. Today this happened again. I love playing in the rain and that my daddyÂ´s aptitude is so embarrassing. GGRRRRR.  </p><p>So here I am, under a huge umbrella arguing with my daddy because I will not leave earlier just because of a "little" rain that is falling down not as heavy yet, while my peers are playing and having fun.  </p><p>Last year I meet an amazing kid who really plays soccer fucking well and who scored two fantastic goals on me. One, he tricked me by kicking the ball to my goal "backward", as the ball passed over me and I didn't even realized it as this happened. Then his peers, began saying "Well done "Zoinho" or Amazing goal "Zoio". I didnt realize he was cross eyed until then. Later on that same game, he scored again, fucking bastard. Then again I heard those same nicknames, zoinho or zoio or "vesguinho". That all means a cross eyed guy. Now he is my best friend, but the funny thing is that he sees better than I do without any glasses at all. On my England trip, the Moorefield doctors said he has a very good sight and that surgery certainly would open up a "Pandora box" on his actual case. I know it makes no good and I hate to say so, but I envy him... such, because he has good vision and all. I know IÂ´ve said that before, but just in case I didnÂ´t, here is it. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, plusheavy...

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2011, 16:23</p><p>Hi, you guys... I am sorry but I didn't mean to start an argument about weather, that was just an statment. </p><p> </p><p>Danny... After years "in and out" trying bifocals with no success because of strabismus and nystagmus due to aphakia, finally I got permanent bifocals by 14, I might be wrong but the ADD was about +9:00. Since I was 16 they (I mean, doctors) try and argue about three lenses thing but nystagmus and strabimsus are in the way of help. Because of lack of the internal lenses and some muscles in my eyes things always goes weirdo whenever I go visiting doctors as they stares each other while scratching their heads. Lol.  </p><p> </p><p>Actually, my prescription arouse a bit, but the adding reached to almost +11:00 but the fight about three lenses has started again, but that would be after the surgery. I argued about surgery and I simply frozen out and decided not to stay in England. We left England as soon as I got my new glasses. HEHEHEH. </p><p>I just couldn't help it. Actually I have two different glasses and I always have some spare back home, just in case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Anderson, already with a job.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2011, 10:58</p><p>This will be WAY off topic in some minds, but maybe not. </p><p>I would like to suggest that this thread in particular, along with a few others on ES, are much more than just a place to post a few dry Rx numbers.  It is a place where people who have special vision problems can share their experiences in dealing with many different types of situations associated with having to wear very strong glasses. Ideally, without being criticised, suffering ridicule, or being very unwilling objects of curiosity. </p><p>Few people who need very strong glasses would volunteer for the experience.  Particularly those who have had to deal with it since birth.  Obviously, there are some here who would like to get an idea of what it is like to have to wear strong vision correction,  Fortunately, they can do it fairly easily and harmlessly with GOC.  One of the nice things about GOC is that you can stop whenever you want to. The typical poster on this thread does not have that choice. </p><p>Many are relatively young hyperopes who have this thread and use it to learn how others deal with common problems related to their need for very strong glasses. Problems such as lack of peripheral vision, depth perception, dioplia, etc.  By sharing solutions to the "peripheral" problems, they learn how others with similar problems, have learned to live life with their problems and sometimes discover that others have figured out how to do pretty much what they want to, in spite of their vision problems. </p><p>Let me give you an example.  4eyes, whom we have known here for many years,  recently turned 18.  He is a native of Brazil where Soccer or Futbol seems to be in the genes.  Most people would say that with severe esotropia and hyperopia north of +30, there is no way he could possibly play soccer.  Wrong!  He regularly plays amateur soccer as Goal Keeper and that ball is simply not going to get past him, period.  How does he do it?  Not even his doctors know for sure, but like the bumble bee that is not supposed to be able to fly, he does it anyway.  To add more to the fun, he recently discovered another young player with good vision in each eye, but severe, uncorrectable esotropia.  It turns out that this young player is a deadly accurate kicker (no real surprise here, a sharpshooter aims his gun with only one eye).   </p><p>Now, they play on the same team and the fans love it (and them).  Between the two of them, they drive the opposing team, crazy.  You can often tell what someone is going to do by what direction they are looking, not with these two.  The result is frequent wins and lots of consternation on the part of the opposing teams. </p><p>Soccer is not the only thing 4eyes does well and he inspires others to find ways to excel, in spite of their vision problems.  Which is why we kind of like him around here. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

One of the biggest problems with prescribing complex, high minus Rx glasses and achieving good acuity is image minification on the retina and vertex distance effects. </p><p>An opthalmologist here in Houston uses a refraction technique for high myopes where he fits them with contact lenses that correct them to below -5 and then does a standard refraction without having to be concerned about vertex distance effects.  With your Rx, vertex distance effects are about 0.225 or almost 0.25 diopters per mm. </p><p>Your -4 astigmatism is certainly a factor, but you might be able to wear some relatively low cost -8.00 to -10.00 sphere only soft contacts and the rest of your Rx, including the cylinder, in "non-draconian" glasses. </p><p>To give you an idea how this would work, if you eliminate the vertex distance effects, your sphere Rx is around -12.00 with ZERO vertex distance and your cylinder is still around -4.00.  If you could wear some -10.00 sphere only contacts, your glasses sphere Rx would only be around -2.00 with -4.00 cylinder.  At those values, vertex distance has little or no effect.  Of course, this would need to be done with the blessings of an open minded Eye Care Professional. </p><p>If you would like to discuss this idea privately, please feel free to contact me at cactusjack1928@hotmail.com. </p><p>May I ask where you live and your age? </p><p>C.  </p><p></p><hr>

The optician said they weren't hi index and were thinner than other frames I had done with them because the frame size was smaller but I simply didn't believe this, and my girlfriend's vision certainly wasn't anywhere near as crisp she tells as with other frames she wears with CR39 lenses so unfortunately we flogged this frame. </p><p> </p><p>It was a frame she was after for a while but loads of opticians will only do hi index lenses for her prescription and she can't stand these - understandably! </p><p> </p><p>Best wishes for the New Year!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2010, 01:17</p><p>Hi Francis. I am like you and need to wear strong plus glasses, which you say are heavy. My solution is simple.  </p><p>When my daughter who is 4 had to begin wearing glasses, her first pair came with the curly metal earpieces that fitted around her ears. I said to the optician, i wish they made frames like that for adults, as my glasses spend half the time down my nose. He informed me he could change the arms on my glasses and fit curly type, which a week later he completed for me. No more problems of glasses slipping and once you get used to the earpieces holding the glasses in place behind your ears, its great. Would never go back to normal type now. Hope this helps. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2010, 05:51</p><p>I am posting this topic here in the hope that you can solve this puzzle!  </p><p> </p><p>I recently had these glasses reglazed - this is the photo after they had been done - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731005509/http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=150514976020&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MESOX:IT" target="_blank">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item;=150514976020&amp;ssPageName;=STRK:MESOX:IT</a> </p><p> </p><p>I had a -9.75 prescription fitted in them, with no cyl and standard CR39 lenses. However, when they arrived, the lenses were remarkably thin for this prescription, they are just 4mm thick. I thought then the optician must have fitted hi index lenses, but she said, no, they were cr39 lenses, and it was because the frame was quite small that the lenses weren't as thick as others I'd reglazed by them. </p><p> </p><p>However, I found yesterday an interesting tool which lets you put the dimensions of your chosen frame, along with your prescription, and PD, and it will tell you how thick the lenses will be with various different lens types. With CR39 lenses and this prescription, the lens thickness should be 9.7mm at the outer edge, however, it isn't even half that! Even if you select 1.74 hi index lenses, the lens thickness should be 6.7 mm. The said website is here - some of you may find this interesting for prospective purchases to see how thick the lenses will be - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731005509/http://www.justeyewear.com/thickness-calculator/" target="_blank">http://www.justeyewear.com/thickness-calculator/</a> (for some reason it won't work in Internet Explorer so I use Mozilla Firefox). </p><p> </p><p>They have fitted -9.75 lenses as I've compared it to other frames, and the edges haven't been bevelled down as you can still see the unpolished edges in their normal profile.  </p><p> </p><p>I just can't figure this one out, someone please help solve this mystery!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2010, 09:31</p><p>Frances, </p><p>Almost all babies are born far or longsighted, but have extremely good accommodation to compensate for it.  Babies eyeballs must necessarily be small because they must fit within the eye sockets of their small heads.  It takes a month or so for a baby to learn to focus their ciliary muscles and coordinate eye movement. </p><p>It is believed that the act of accommodating triggers the production of a hormone that causes the eyeball to grow as the head grows until the size of the eyeball matches the optical power of the cornea and crystaline lens.  It is also believed that there is a genetic component that limits or promotes the production of the hormone. </p><p>If there is not enough hormone production, growth is limited and the result is hyperopia.  Excessive hormone production causes excessive eyeball growth and the result is myopia.  Because of the genetic component, it is possible that your daughter MAY have in effect inherited hyperopia, but there is also a chance that she did not. </p><p>It is probably a bit too early to tell if she is having trouble focusing close, but I would suggest watching her closely for any tendency for her eyes to turn inward or difficulty seeing close objects.  At some point a visit to a pediatric opthalmologist might be worth considering if you see any signs of vision problems. </p><p>May I ask what prompted your mother to have your eyes checked at a very young age? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Frances</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2010, 08:43</p><p>Owlish. My mother told me in later years that my first prescription was +7. and shortly after went up again.

<p><b>Owlish</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2010, 08:04</p><p>Francis,  you are doing the right thing in keeping a close watch on your daughter's vision.  I can't say what the odds are, but she definitely has a greater chance of being hyperopic that does a child whose parents have perfect eyesight.  I think both the tendency to shortsight and the tendency to longsight are often inherited.  Just as in your case, hyperopia can be present in infancy and probably should be addressed as early as possible. </p><p>Do you know roughly what your Rx was at age two?  I'm wondering whether it was near +13 then or whether it progressed a lot over the years.</p><p></p><hr>

And Sam12744 along with Still and All4Eyes. Thanks. </p><p> </p><p>NJ, your vision description is gave me a very clear way to express myself about the way I see the world when doctors ask me about. Yours and that of Danny showed me what doctors actually means by asking me about my vision. I always thought theirs were abstract or silly questions. The loss of visual field is the most difficult part of my plus lenses. I thought I was the only one with such difficulties, but I am not. Due to my uncommon strabismus, I learned I will never get a permit to drive. I find this funny, because I can see couple meters ahead of me, but I cannot say who is by my side, with or without my glasses. I have what is called cross fixation, that means I use my right eye with a head turn to my right shoulder to look at things ahead of me or to my left side or my left eye with my head turned to my left shoulder when looking straight ahead to subject to my right side but, even so my peripheral vision sucks. The meaning to turn left or right side to me is a matter for serious confusion as I never know promptly where is left/right side. LOL. It took ages for me to learn to ride a bike and when I go to the park, I am not allowed to go by myself, because I "endanger" the others. It seems they cannot predict where I'll go. Bah... </p><p> </p><p>I am not sure I read it right, but, for the one who is in doubt about implanting internal lenses, if I had any chance at all of having them internally implanted, I wouldn't think twice about having them instead of an eyeglasses with over +30:00 DP and  ADD over +10:00 DP for reading only not to mention those annoying prisms. Anyway... I hope this one in doubt get over it and get an Implant, if necessary. </p><p>Thanks again to everybody about my birthday.

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2010, 18:46</p><p>Infants and small children need a clear picture in order for the visual cortex to develop normally. Unfortunately, many infants with cataracts used to not get the surgery right away, the result was cortical visual impairment which cannot be corrected with glasses. So if lenses are needed to see clearly, then it is immensely important that kids wear them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2010, 12:07</p><p>Francis and others, </p><p>Most babies are born very far or longsighted, but have extreme accommodation to allow them to compensate.  It usually takes a month or two for them to learn how to control their ciliary and eye positioning muscles and focus their eyes.  There can be a lot of things that go wrong with this process.  If, by 2, a child is unable to focus, something has gone wrong and correction is appropriate to provide the best vision possible.  It is possible that vision correction could minimize eyeball growth, but at that early age, development of the visual cortex by supplying it with the best possible images and the mental development  gained from visual sources is extremely important.  If vision correction is needed, it should be done as soon as possible, even if it might reduce long term eyeball growth.  Far or long sightedness can be corrected, impaired mental development cannot. </p><p>Several years ago, I was in a shop and there was a young mother with a baby much less than a year old.  The baby was wearing moderately high plus glasses with significant prism correction.  For some reason, the mother took the baby's glasses off and the baby immediately started crying.  The mother put the baby's glasses back on and the crying stopped.  Even at that age, given a choice, the baby preferred the better vision provided by the glasses and was not reluctant to announce that fact. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2010, 12:42</p><p>what is your prescription RL?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2010, 12:30</p><p>Just for the fun of it I ordered a pair of full field CR39 glasses in a 54 mm frame to see how they would turn out. They are interesting to say the least. The right (-12) lens is full field and is about a half inch thick at the outer edge, but for the left lens the cutting tool was too steep to cover the full width of the lens so it made essentially a myodisc with a plano carrier and a 40mm oblong bowl. That lens is about five sixteenths of an inch thick. So the glasses have the best or worst (depending on your point of view) of both kinds of lenses. A very thick lens and a semi-myodisc lens. The unusual left lens really calls attention to the difference in the size of my eyes which both look really small to begin with. My right appearing to be about the size of a penny and the left smaller than a dime when seen through the lenses. The glasses are really comfortable though in spite of their unusual look and thickness. I figure I'll wear these when I want people to see just how nearsighted I really am. No hiding it with myodiscs, which some folks mistake for plus lenses. I figure if I'm stuck with strong glasses, why not have some fun with them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2010, 12:11</p><p>One of the good things about minus power myodiscs is that the field of vision is good. In my case, the bowls fit very close to my eyes and I'm not aware of the plus power carriers. I can look around without turning my head too much and there is almost no distortion at the edges because the bowls use only the center 30mm of the lens.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2010, 09:54</p><p>HAI NJ </p><p>pls mail to me </p><p>anjana022@gmail.com </p><p> </p><p>i am interested to have a discussion with guys with thick glasses</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2010, 13:37</p><p>You can get some sense of high plus lenses by taking a couple of toilet paper tubes, holding them up to your eyes, and trying to walk around. Your house will be hard enough, now imagine doing this in a crowded mall! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2010, 13:33</p><p>Loss of visual field is by far the most difficult part of high plus lenses. There are a number of write-ups on the advantages of IOLs post-cataract surgery, and they discuss the problems with magnification and the pin-cushion effect--and of course the cosmetics. Leaving aside cosmetics, I find neither of these to be an issue. Magnification is relative, so perceiving something as magnified is, at worst, a temporary phenomenon.  </p><p> </p><p>However, the loss of visual field is very limiting. I have about 20 degrees of peripheral vision in +20 lentics, but this is reduced by the 'roving' ring scotoma that effectively means that moving my eyes to the side, other than a few degrees, is not really an option. In addition, the only clear focal region in the lens is a small spot right in the optical center.  </p><p> </p><p>The most challenging conditions are situations in which object around me, usually people, move in unpredictable ways. Walking in a crowd is very hard, shopping in a grocery store with aisles means a lot of head turning to look down the aisle but not bump into anyone or trip over anything. Little kids are especially troublesome, as they move quickly and unpredictably, and they are out of my visual field unless I am looking down at the ground, which of course means I can't see what's more than a few feet ni front of me. </p><p> </p><p>Then there is the whole reading challenge through tiny bifocal adds. Really hard.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Owlish</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2010, 09:43</p><p>Hi NJ, Francis, and anyone else who wears strong plus glasses.  If I had to get cataract surgery I would be tempted to have it done without implants.

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2010, 12:27</p><p>@Plusheavy: I can attest to everything you say about high plus lentics. I wear +20ou and head-turning is essential to see anything that is even slightly off the visual axis.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>plusheavy</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2010, 05:29</p><p>myodiscs of very strong plus lenses make the field of vision, already very restricted, intolerably narrow. Looking at the world through keyholes is not only enormously annoying but also dangerous, particularly when trying to negotiate kerbs, climbing stairs, and even walking straight ahead. Wearers of very strong plus lenses must constantly turn their heads in various directions to be able to see anything which is only centimeters off their line of vision when they look straight forward This is perhaps more bothersome than anything else connected with wearning those awesome lenses I wish someone posted some photographs of strong plus wearers, similar to those magificent minuses worn by Elijah, Junior, etc. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2010, 18:01</p><p>I think it is easier to get the lens nearer the eye with a plus carrier. When you have high myopia, all that minification can be partly offset by bringing the correction nearer the eye. </p><p> </p><p>Okay it looks a bit strange, but none of the alternatives look hugely better, and the optical benefits much outweigh the smallish improvement in aesthetics.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2010, 17:14</p><p>Stingray; the plus carriers allow the outer edges of the lens to be very thin which is the idea behind myodisc lenses. I agree that it does cause quite a contrast between the minus bowl and the carrier. I wear -15 myodiscs with 30mm bowls and the carrier is about a +8,so my eyes look really small while the edges of my face are magnified significantly. It is a distinctive look for sure but the benefit is a very light, thin lens. I once had some myodiscs that did have a minus carrier. The problem was that the edges were much thicker, about 6 or 7mm and the most annoying thing was that the bowls were much smaller in diameter, probably about 24mm, which encroached on my peripheral vision. With pure plano carriers the problem is less pronounced, but the bowls still have to be smaller than with plus. The other thing about the myodiscs is that I can get them in CR39 plastic and they are still so thin that the edges of the lens are thinner than the frame. If I go to a full fileld CR39 lens they are 17mm thick at the edges. So since I'm stuck with the myodiscs I've decided long ago to enjoy them and the good vision they provide. Besides they're exotic as all getout.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>stingray</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2010, 15:55</p><p>With a reference to myodisc lenses, why are plus carriers preferred to minus carriers?  It would appear to me that minus carriers would be more ascetically appearing to the wearer and not be such a stark appearance as they appear in plus carriers.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2010, 05:06</p><p>All4eyes, </p><p>Thank you and all the others for your kind birthday wishes.   </p><p>I read somewhere that it takes 10,000 hours of study and practice to get really good at something.  I seem to recall that the statement was made regarding musical performance, but I think it is applicable to more than that.  If that is true, I've got a several thousand to go.  I wish I had started sooner and studied harder, but that is my fault, no one else.  20/20 hindsight to keep it in the realm of Eyescene. </p><p>It is a myth that you have to go to school to learn something (mostly propagated by poor schools).  If it is a very good SCHOOL, it can be a more efficient place to learn and get credentials than just reading and studying.  Unfortunately, many schools just provide credentials and any real knowledge and experience gained is almost accidental. </p><p>Always remember, it is never too late to start.  Dare to dream and DARE TO DO.  You never know where life will lead you.  The world is changing at an exponential rate.  When I graduated from high school in 1954, Thomas Watson, head of IBM, said that the thought there might be a market for 12 computers in the world.  He "misunderestimated" by at least a few hundred million and we ain't seen nothing yet in almost every field.   </p><p>What a wonderful time to be alive if you see the future as a wonderful adventure and a miserable time if you really wish for the past.   </p><p>My very best to everyone and thanks again. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2010, 20:52</p><p>Hi you guys </p><p> </p><p>I hope I don't offend you, if so... please excuse-me. </p><p> </p><p>Today I just have to write this as part of How do I see thing. </p><p> </p><p>As were flying across Central America from Manaus, Amazonas in Brazil to UCLA in Los Angeles, California, USA, something very funny (to me, at least) happened related to my eyes.  </p><p> </p><p>My daddy is very fond of his little Brazilian aircraft and I care about it too, but after a little nap I lazily got up and kind of sleeping, I went to the aircraft toilet to pee. I am not even thinking about my eyeglasses as I am still sleeping and I intend to return to my total laziness as soon as possible. </p><p>As I start to pee I hear it hitting the base of vase but not the water sound I should so did my daddy who shouts angrily if I have my glasses on. </p><p>I have to pay real attention to what I am doing as I keep urinating outside the vase and my daddy is not being of any help at all. The man is getting real pissed off, but I couldnt help to stop my pee and adjusting my dick was only worsening the whole thing as I can not see where I am peeing. I murmured if he could get my glasses as I really can not see clearly when colors are the same or if there are transparencies. But as my daddy gets angrier the more I miss the focus on peeing inside the vase and I ended partially wetting myself so I had to change my clothes. We both ended up laughing at my wet pants. Me? I better remember take my glasses with me when going to pee if I dont want any other accident. </p><p> </p><p>I have difficult with transparency and objects with same colors so we have very colorful tools for meals and things. I cant tell you if I have a glass full of water and I even have hit glass display on shoppings and things. Lol. </p><p> </p><p>Anderson from Brazil, arrived in L. A.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2010, 16:50</p><p>Holidays has arrived... Yuppieee. </p><p> </p><p>Dont ask me how but somehow I always used my eyes my own way to get the best vision I could get since baby, hehehe. Well, thats what every doctors says so, but only learned something the first time I visited a doctor by four. I remember clearly when the eye specialist keep adjusting my head straight ahead and that that was making me feel sick, as every time he adjust my head the world would go like spinning madly causing me such sickness and annoying me so much I asked him what was that he wanted me to do?  </p><p>I want you to read those signal ahead he said pointing at something big and empty hanging on the wall ahead, asking the nurse to hold still my head but I couldnt see anything at all after nearly sticking his fingers into my eyes so much he kept asking how my of them I could see. I told him I was getting real sick and that it would be better if he allowed me read those things the way I could. Only after I got real sick and almost threw all over him he send me back to the waiting room and later, maybe so that I wouldnt do another mess, he allowed me read the chart my own way. I nearly got beaten by the sisters from the Orphanage on my returning later. Funny enough I dont remember ever returning to that Eye Clinic, but that day was when I first got the feeling doctors never listen to what we have to say. So I used to say first about those feeling if they would leave me alone. What I was having is called nystagmus, something I learned to avoid at any cost somehow. The thing I learned to keep my eyes perfectly still and I could avoid those wobbling and jerking things. So I have them shit crossed yet. Those names things I get from doctors.  </p><p>Id never realize I have bad sight but when I first put on eyeglasses I couldnt believe my eyes and then I didnt want to take them off even to get them fitted right way. I told I was about four years ol then. I looked at my hands and at my feet. I looked at every sisters face and I even went outside to take a look around, I think only to have them stolen couple weeks later. </p><p>My vision is real shit, but glasses fix that very much. With them off, I can not tell out of anything away from a 1 meter and half. I can not play or even tell my daddy is in front of me dancing from say, seven feet or 2 meters +/- unless he says something. Actually I think I relay on any sound at all than on my sight. Yet this is weirdo, because inside home, if my daddy doesnt keep remembering me about them I wouldnt mind having them, unless I want to play on computer or video game. And to add to shit, lately it looks like Im seeing two of everything in the world sometimes, and that is driving me NUT. Luckily I can ignore them or they look away apart from one another. enough to bothers me, but this is annoying, anyway. </p><p>With my glasses on I am not 100% corrected but maybe 60% or even 80% in good days, but what matters is that I can read easily or play on computer or on my 42 TV video game or read Music sheet clear on two synthesizers I have. I go out play with others guys and ride my bike and even play soccer, thou lately I am playing really bad to my dismay that I avoid playing it and only watch the others play. I think those spells began last year after stem cells treatment, but them, those doctors seems not to listen to me. Now I understand that when I put my glasses it is like I seeing the world through a Binocle Binoculars or through a pair of hole I am not sure I can explain it, suffice to say that I feel quite uncomfortable in crowded places and things, bumping and hitting on people at my side and that is really embarrassing, mostly when they look at me. There are many days everything looks cool and almost sharp. But if I have a bad night, the next day will be really messy, blurrier than ever, those will be shitty days. </p><p>When I am without my glasses I can not easily read even if I stick my nose into a book like those big Harry Potter hard cover books, because within two hours can not go on any more as my eyes shakes back and forth madly and I dont dare moving them at all. I can not even tell you about my own features if I am not close enough of the mirror, say 20 centimeters. Usually I dont like what I see, so I dont care. How did I lived in streets over 30 months, I still wonder how. Hehehe. Actually Id never crossed street alone, back those months. I was a real chicken. I learned to cross streets when everybody was doing so. Smart arse I was back those years. I only focused on the green lights as I could distinguish them. </p><p>Im sorry I bothered you all with this. And I am not even sure I did answer your question correctly. </p><p> </p><p>Anderson from Brazil. Ready to go to UCLA in USA tomorrow! Sniff Sniff </p><p> </p><p>PS. Keep in mind my English sucks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2010, 12:26</p><p>To get an idea of what it is like to be extremely hyperopic and need very high plus glasses, order a pair of SGS's -27 glasses and wear them without any contacts or correction - assuming you are not extremely myopic yourself.  If you wear minus contacts, try the -27s with the contacts in place. </p><p>It is not possible to completely simulate 4eyes situation if you have crystaline lenses because the position of the natural lenses in relation to the retina is optically very important. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2010, 17:25</p><p>Hi and thanks for returning my questions. </p><p> </p><p>Puffin &amp; Danny, when I say Id never study English I mean Id never been in a private or any English school here in neither Brazil nor any other English spoken country, yet I have to say Ive a great friend in USA who kindly teaches me. Also, I realize last year, that being only couple days in Camargue, France, I was absolutely comfortable speaking French as well I was speaking Spanish, funny isnt? Maybe I do have a thing for foreign idiom just like I do for music, doctors says I have an amazing HEARS here. Go figure. </p><p>Danny, years ago I used to have 2 pairs of glasses (for distance and another for reading) because I couldnt stand bifocals at all. But losing eyesglasses so often changed doctors mind to get me into bifocals training. </p><p>My eyes changed very little in fifteen months, so did my prescriptions reluctantly remained as +33:50 and +34:75. My eyeglasses were made by Germany Carl Zeiss laboratories and are really expensive because of press-on  +11:00/13:50 Add Press On bottom lenses AND they have 15 Base Out prisms blocks with 35 Prisms BO Press-On prisms so that I dont need those eyes devices like magnifier to help me with my annoying strabismus and aphakia I think that is how they assembled my eyeglasses. Whew. </p><p>Martyn, Ive been visiting that four store red brick Hospital for over four years so I do trust those doctors, I only dont like to go. I know Im a very lucky guy otherwise, I wouldnt be here talking with you guys but maybe dead living in São Paulo streets yet. My treatments are followed by real good doctors AND Universities in England and USA, but they, I mean the treatments are very stressful and annoying so sometimes I would like just to avoid them or better yet, NOT NEED THEM at all. </p><p>Moorfield Eye Hospital along with the Queen Mary University, are great I think and I am lucky to go there. </p><p>WHEW I hope your hears dont hurt after that much talking.  </p><p>Ill go now, or somebody will kick me out </p><p> </p><p>FUI. Anderson, soon to 18 yo. YESSS </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Danny</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2010, 00:08</p><p>Puffin: of course English was not a "planned" language; it was invented by a process of mixing languages together before written and printed language was in common use. Most other languages evolved after the printing press. </p><p> </p><p>4eyes: Sorry for the confusion - I used to post as "Gray" but now I use "Danny" after some confusion (in another chat room). I still use +25 left eye for reading and +19 right eye for distance. </p><p> </p><p>The optician wanted to sell me 2 pairs of glasses (1 distance and 1 reading) but the single lenses works well and I don't lose the pair that's in my pocket (or sit on them) </p><p> </p><p>How strong are your lenses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Martyn</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2010, 17:52</p><p>Hi 4eyes you could not be in better hands than Moorfield eye hospital, i had reason to visit there a few years back they we very professional  informative, do,nt worry you will be in good hands good luck</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2010, 17:30</p><p>4eyes </p><p> </p><p>You are very wise to avoid the study of English. It is the "C" of real languages. Planned it is not. (American English is like C++... an improvement on a mess) </p><p> </p><p>Spanish is much easier to learn, and glasses don't make much difference to this.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2010, 16:19</p><p>Hi you guys... this thread looks populated again, hehehe </p><p> </p><p>I am sorry, </p><p> </p><p>Gray, are your days of bifocals gone for real?  </p><p> </p><p>I hate I have over +10,00 Add for "reading" and Id suggest doing the same you did to my doctors but no doctors who attends me accept the suggestion. So, may I ask you howre you doing if you dont mind me bothering you? I am just trying to get the best sight I can actually get. </p><p>  </p><p>I am about to return to Moorefield Hospital within two weeks and I cant say I am looking forward to as I am sure I will be a toy to be played in their hands, them doctors. I dont like them and my daddy knows it, but, it seems there is nothing he can do about, but to try to understand it more At least it will be summer time up in England. </p><p>Gray, if youre still hanging around, Id love to hear from you about bifocals. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks, Anderson. </p><p>PS. I know my English sucks, but bare in mind Id never study English. That is it. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2010, 09:14</p><p>Question for those with drying eyes as mentioned below - how long in years does it take before this problem hit? And does wearing contact lenses make it sooner? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>TonyBG</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2010, 08:23</p><p>Hello KK! Looks like you have fascination of strong glasses. OK! Yes I have blurry vision for both close and distance. Peripheral vision - even worse. So every time when I want to see s/thing sideways I have to turn my head. </p><p>For everyday use I have +16dptr. glasses. And +20/lenticulars for reading, close work, computers etc. Very slight astigmatism. Used to use contact lenses - especially for driving, swimming. My eyes are drying quicky nowadays, so no more contacts. I may have to give up driving as well as my vision is getting worse. But I do not despair - the Brazilian boy is well ahead on this field. </p><p>BTW. Will send you some pictures very soon.</p><p></p><hr>

Do you know the cause of your hyperopia?  One of our young members, 4eyes from Brazil, also has severe hyperopia (in the +30 range) and very high esotropia, but he manages amazingly well, so well that his eye doctors have trouble understanding how he does it. </p><p>May I also ask your age and where you live? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2010, 06:27</p><p>Soda, </p><p>It is extremely hard to describe how another person sees.  In the case of extreme hyperopia and +18 is extreme it is likely that she either her crystaline lenses are not fully developed (many time caused by the mothers illness during pregnancy) or her eyeballs are much shorter than is typical.  The end result is that her eyes cannot focus on anything no matter what the distance.  I was asked where a person with extreme hypeopia would focus and I said somewhere beyond the star Alpha Centauri (4 light years away).  In addition, high plus glasses act to some extent like binoculars or telescopes.  They have a very narrow field of vision so it is likely that she does not have good peripheral vision.  It may not be possible for her to get a driving license depending on the local rules. </p><p>Assuming you need no vision correction, you could get an idea of how she sees by asking an optician to put some -18 lenses in a trial frame and let you try them.  The -18 may not be exactly accurate, but at those levels of blurriness, it won't make much difference. </p><p>Additionally, it is not unusual for a person with that level of hyperopia to have other problems with their retina or with underdevelopment of the visual cortex which can cause vision problems.  Remember, vision occurs in the brain, the eyes are merely biological cameras.  It may not be possible for her to be corrected to 20/20. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JR</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2010, 12:02</p><p>Catus Jack </p><p> </p><p>My first wife did and does wear contacts to correct for -20 and over glasses to pick up her astigmatism and a little minus. She went to the combo when soft lenes became easy and comfortable.  </p><p> </p><p>With the hard lens they egnored the astigmatism and over corrected the minus. But they were hard to wear and the softs are easy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2010, 11:19</p><p>berni, </p><p>The term 20/20 refers to the ability to read the 20 foot line on a standard Snellen Eye Chart from a distance of 20 feet.  In countries that use metric standards it is often stated as 6/6 meaning the ability to read the 6 meter line from a distance of 6 meters. </p><p>If a person has less visual acuity than "normal", the number might be 20/100 meaning that they can only read the 100 line from 20 feet.  If they have better than normal, the number might be 20/15 meaning that they can read the 15 foot line (the one below the 20 line) from a distance of 20 feet. </p><p>If you want to know more about the Snellen chart, do a search on any good search engine. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2010, 11:08</p><p>All, </p><p>I have often been curious if a combination of contacts and glasses could offer better visual acuity in very high myopes than glasses alone.  There is an eye surgeon here in Houston who has written about and uses a technique of refraction for high myopes (and perhaps high hyperopes).   </p><p>As part of the pre-surgical procedure, he needs to do a precision refraction.  He fits the patient with contact lenses that correct most, but not all, of their myopia.  The idea is to get the remaining myopia low enough that vertex distance effects of the phropter and its internal lenses are negligible.  After the contacts have settled, he does the refraction to arrive at a final Rx with little error. </p><p>We have discussed GOC extensively on another thread, but that has been to permit the wearing of a radically different Rx than normally required.  The idea of wearing a corrective combination of glasses over contacts for high myopia would seem to help in two areas.  By putting the majority of the sphere Rx in the contacts, minimization of the image on the retina caused by vertex distance, would be reduced and the central part of the image would be spread over more rods and cones in the High Definition, central portion of the retina, which should improve acuity.  The other benefit would be that a relatively low Rx in glasses can then be used to "fine tune" the sphere, correct for astigmatism, and any prism or add required, with minimal edge distortion.  If the final glasses Rx was simple enough, the final correction could be made with low cost glasses from an on line retailer such as Zenni. </p><p>Obviously, this idea would need to involve an Eye Care Professional to fit the contacts and do a refraction with the contacts in place.  It would seem to me that with the availability of low cost contacts up to the -20s and low cost glasses, it might be possible to substantially reduce the cost of visual correction and improve acuity.   I would also think that those ECPs, who have ethical problems with typical GOC, would find GOC for improved acuity to be highly acceptable, but you might have to reason with them a little. </p><p>Of course it would not be very satisfying to the OOs in the group who may also be high myopes. </p><p>Any thoughts? </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;21 Feb 2010, 13:24</p><p>Hi you guys. </p><p> </p><p>Wow... This place's been real busy. </p><p>  </p><p>Julian, I think I saw STORMS SNOW and whiteness for a lifetime, really. I couldn't even keep my eyes properly open. LOL. </p><p> </p><p>I like England, if we put aside those eyes doctor's visiting. There is a Music instruments close to Hyde Park that I love so much and the owner... well, I this he is the owner, anyway, he is real cool. He says I help on  selling stuffs. hehehe. We arrived  by the December week in time to New Year Party by the hotel, but just to think the Summer season I left behind and I wanted to weep.  </p><p>The trip to England was nice, but those steam cells shots I really hate. By the end of those two weeks sessions I was throwing out my own belly. Those really make me sick. But then there was only play and fun and trips for while.  No doctors visiting for almost a week. YEAHH. Then, two days for eyes checking and off to USA.  </p><p> </p><p>We arrived by 25 Monday by evening and stayed 'till Saturday 30, when we left.  But the funniest thing to happen has happened twice. In England doctors asked me stay without glasses, "In a safe environment" they said so... for three hours per, at least two days... Had to struggle to not screaming "Yes I would love to" I almost asked my Dad, but then I though "They are asking me to" and I pretend I didn't heard that. He is a "pain in ass" typo. </p><p> </p><p>Then... in USA California, UCLA Children Hospital I've been asked the same, but only for few hours until next day when I arrived at UCLA without my glasses and there, doctors too performed a series of exams and computer measurements and boring kids stuffs for half a day, Jesus... Only sometimes they would call others doctors into the room, and it was funny to see them gathering around, a truly guinea pig. </p><p>The real great news of all this trip is that my eyes haven't change a thing in these last six months but strabismus and UCLA doctors promised "maybe" a light tinted eyeglasses. WOOOPYYY. </p><p>From  this trip I think only my strabismus took some major interesting part, but I still think I'd rather "get rid of it" for once instead of being watched out only. I don't care 'bout my eye sight, but it is the crossing of them that annoys me because that is what everybody sees. </p><p>That is it for now, I'm having doctors visiting next April month </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

She has a small collection of very tatty part broken glasses going back probably 10 years. I have noticed that with her current glasses on occasions she slides them up and down her nose by small amounts depending on what she is doing. She is 38 so probably nearing that time life.... Its also apparent that because her maximum focussing distance is less than the tip of the nose she cannot achieve binocular vision as when she reads without her glasses (normally her mobile screen) she shuts one eye holds the phone very close to the other - looks a bit strange </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2010, 06:36</p><p>UK Guest. Hi. I don't suppose your gfs old glasses will be as strong as her current ones, so how she managed for a whole week is amazing. Really with -12.00 she should have a spare pair in the same rx like me now. It's virtually a no brainer lol.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2010, 12:02</p><p>The blizzard continues, and you wouldn't know that we shoveled snow 5 hours ago.  I should have worn my white cat's-eyes in honor of this 2nd snowstorm in 4 days.  :)  I'm glad I picked up my new big black drop-temples on Monday.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2010, 08:19</p><p>This morning I went without my -9.00's (the purple drop-temples that are wider at the bottom) for about an hour, as my husband and I were shoveling 8 inches of global warming from our huge driveway, while sleet was falling.

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2010, 07:09</p><p>Gerald </p><p> </p><p>I dated a woman who was -8.50 and she squinted.  She told me squinting helped when she did not have glasses or contacts.  I also dated a woman who was -9, who never squinted and never did anything functional including taking a shower without her glasses on her face.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2010, 06:47</p><p>UK Guest </p><p> </p><p>I find what you've written about your girl friend quite amazing! I'm -12.25 and -13.00 at the moment and I know how utterly useless I feel without my glasses. Ok I could put my clothes on and stuff but I'd be so scared of my glasses getting damaged if I threw them down on the bed etc. I've also been known to walk around the house sometimes without glasses when my eyes are really tired but its easy to walk into things if my idiot brother has left something out of place. Then my father will tell me off and say, for goodness sake put your glasses on Rachel. Your gf is so brave i reckon</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>UK Guest</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2010, 04:17</p><p>My partner is highly myopic (-12 ish) and when she is not wearing her glasses never squints. I soon realised that at her level of myopia squinting is futile. When she takes off her glasses (which is not very often!) she does not exhibit any of the signs of somebody who has moderate myopia. (I.e. always squinting to see) </p><p> </p><p>She surprises me that considering how dependant she is on her glasses she will often take them off and 'throw' them on the bed or a chair whilst she does something like changes her clothes etc. She will then put stuff down on top of them or sit on the bed or chair where she left them. I often see her groping around for her glasses on the bed or floor and she never gets stressed about the possibility of stepping on them or being unable to find them. Additionally when we travel she never takes a spare pair of glasses and has actually broken them to some extent on more than one occasion and still never got particularly stressed. </p><p> </p><p>Even when I take her glasses off she doesn't seem to care or start to tell me 'please be careful with my glasses as without them I can't function bla bla'. She once looked down from the bedroom window and her glasses fell off landing in the garden - but she just came downstairs and said casually I may need your help to find my glasses in the garden! </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gerald</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2010, 02:45</p><p>I have seen many myopes without glasses trying to see better by squinting etc. I happened to see a few strong myopes without glasses doing no squinting at all. Does that mean that squinting does no good from some point on? Where can that point be? </p><p> </p><p>Another thing: I have a moderate prescription (-2,5/-2), but I still feel quite nervous about losing my glasses in unfamiliar surroundings, although I probably would get by somehow. But how does a person with serious myopia cope with that? (I once lost my glasses at a concert and had them taken away by bullies and felt pretty helpless at the time).  </p><p> </p><p>Gerald</p><p></p><hr>

Most of the glasses wearers I've known have been myopic, as I am myself, but now I'm married to a wonderful lady who is at least +2 or so.

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2010, 17:05</p><p>TonyGB, </p><p>My earlier myodiscs came from Lenscrafters and were regular plastic. Then they quit making them, so I got a few pairs from Optical 4 Less in Hong Kong, but they are made of high-ndex glass and are subject to breakage. My latest pair came from a small optician in Burbank, CA. I got my first myodiscs when I reached -13. I still have some full-field glasses, but they tend to be quite thick at the outer edges, so I have to stick with high index lenses in those. But I prefer the optical quality of CR 39 plastic, so if I want CR 39 I have to go wtih the myodiscs otherwise the edges are 16mm thick with my present -15 prescription. The high-index full-ield glasses are 11mm at the edge, but that's tolerable. I have some myodiscs that have a plano carrier that doesn't magnify the edges of my face, but the bowls in those are smaller than with the plus carrier.  They are about 35mm with the plus carrier and 27mm with the plano which makes them very thin and light, about 5mm. Quite a difference from 16mm.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2010, 13:19</p><p>TonyGB, </p><p>I am sort of the flip-side from you. I am -15, so there would be a 31 dipopter difference in the way we see things. For instance; without my glasses, everything beyond about 2.5 inches from my eyes is a complete blur. The images I see are smaller in size than real, but I've gotten used to over time. Also, the glasses make my eyes look small. One of my more interesting pairs of glasses are lenticulars (sometimes called myodiscs.) The high minus prescription is in a bowl in the center of the lens and the outside of the lens is actually a plus value. In my case about a +10. So the contrast between my eyes which look really small and the edge of my face which is magnified greatly, is pretty dramatic. I've decided that it's sort of an exotic look. The good thing is that the lenses aren't too thick and are very light.</p><p></p><hr>

Sorry to hear your eyes haven't got better, but at least they're no worse. Listen though: if you're not going to university what are you going to do? You obviously have a good brain and it seems a shame not to make the most of it.  </p><p>And I think you write good English...when I visited Brazil (Belem) and tried to speak Portuguese they said I sounded like a Portuguese - and you will know if nobody else does that in Brazil that's an insult! On the other hand when I went to Madeira and tried to order two beers they brought me two coffees, because I pronounced it the Brazilian way. So English isn't the only language that has its oddities!</p><p></p><hr>

For you know I'd finish school this year and that I won't return school again as I am fed up with bullies and shit. But I did few pre-college exams and it seems I got some real good marks. That is of some comforting, at least I am not retarded; in three of them I stood amongst 20 best marks. But my father found out about two dismissed College invitation I got couple weeks ago while he was on a business trip. So... hum, to calm him down a bit I'd agree to come. I am not complaining but I'll just go thru it and be so. </p><p>I thought he would kill me when he learned that I "politely and kindly" refused to accept an invitation to an University he gives heavy financial support... By the way, one was the same University that always treated me. I kindly told them I hadn't yet done High School and then I shown them gentlemen the way to the door to street after some chatting with tea and cakes. I thanked them for the invitation but I don't trust I'll have a better live than I'd while in school. Just a month ago a student had been badly bullied AND expelled from a University by the HEAD of the College just because she was using a short skirt. No way I'll go back to schoolling. </p><p>But the worst I learned later. I completely misunderstood those doctors jubilation about my eyes, sniff, sniff. My eyes only didn't got worse, humph... big deal. So what? I am here in England for eyes shits stem cells application things but, back to school? Hardly. </p><p>I'll try to enjoy as much as I can my staying here in London, before treatment begins next week and then... well, I'll let you know how things  turns out.

For the first time in my whole life I heard my eyes prescription has not increased at all BUT reduced. They are going to reduce almost up to 3.50 DP from my up and bottom lenses and, yet I understand that's is nothing to my above +30,00, doctors says that that is a huge great news to mine overall eyes condition, yet the strabismus keeps with its variable size deviation, whatever that means. </p><p> </p><p>The bad news is that I'll have to be re checked and re evaluated at Moorefield Hospital in London, where I'd received a "new" treatment back July and that there is the place where I'll get my new glasses. Then, to UCLA Children Hospital in L.A... YET, I'm having this funny feeling that I am being "miss guided"... to avoid saying I'm being tricked into going to England and USA. My daddy is doing everything to trick me into this shit... hum, situation and I hate him for doing this. </p><p> </p><p>Actually I am really fed up with all of this, all I want to do is to get a real job and live my life.  </p><p>Thankfully I'm done with school now and the only stone in my way is getting a job, a thing I'm trying to get for couples of months unsuccessful, maybe because of my looking; cross eyed, ugly glasses and all, but I will have to find a job fast, because next year it is Army service here Brazil and I will use that as my last recourses to leave home.  </p><p>Oh Man... How I wish I would wake up next morning and have my crocked eyes fixed. sigh. Man, I hate so much having crossing eye, more than anything in the world. Sorry I rambled a bit.

I'm -15, so I am right on the borderline of really needing myodiscs, but these are only 4mm thick at the most. 30mm bowls and a plano carrier so it doesn't magnify the sides of my face like previous pairs. They are high index plastic and weigh practically nothing compared to my full field glasses which are 12mm thick even in high index. I'll probably wear these all the time. </p><p>Rachel, are you considering myodiscs now that you've hit -14? I got my first ones at -13.25.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2009, 00:51</p><p>Even before digital cameras, some big branches of Dollond &amp; Aitchison had video cameras so that you could try a frame and then see how it looked on you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2009, 12:42</p><p>4eyes, </p><p> </p><p>The vast majority of my eyewear collection came as a result of my putting on the frames and looking at them as closely as possible in the mirror, and that helped me find out if they fit as well.

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2009, 11:52</p><p>I think this will sound like a stupid question but... How do you choose your eyeglasses frame, if your eyes are real weak and your eyeglasses lenses are somewhat strong? </p><p> </p><p>As far as I try to remember, I'd never choose any one of my glasses, as they Optrometrists says my glasses are difficult to be provided. </p><p> </p><p>Sorry about this stupid question... heh</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2009, 04:23</p><p>Strong glasses can look pretty good if you choose the right style of frames for the shape of your face and colour to compliment you hair clouring. Like red and black go nicely with brown hair and blue and brow n go nice with blonde hair. At least I always thinks so. Wide plastic arms hide the thickness of the lenses from the sides but there isn't a lot you can do about the power rings and "cut in" I'm afraid. That becomes part of your sensual attraction to guys that like girls in glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2009, 06:21</p><p>Michelle the first thing I think you need to know is that you can get glasses online for a fraction of the cost of what an optician will charge you, meaning you can get 2 or 3 pairs for what 1 would normally cost you.  Many supply designer frames or will put new lenses into your old frames if you prefer it for a cost. </p><p> </p><p>As for your questions at the end CR39 is a lens material, and a myodisc lens is a lens cut in a certain way.  CR39 is a low index material, commonly used in low prescriptions, or for those who cant stand the distortions you can get from the higher index materials. </p><p> </p><p>Myodisc lenses differ from standard full field lenses in a few ways.  Firstly, the power that you require is ground into a circle in the middle of the lens directly in front of your eye.  This circle can be anywhere from 15mm in extremely high prescrptions to 35mm+ for lower ones.  The area outside of this 35mm "bowl" is called the carrier.  The carrier does not have your prescription ground into it, instead it is either plano, negative or positive, in other words, the edges can be thinned out towards the edges of your glasses so you no longer have a large edge thickness.  This gives a much lighter lens compared to a full field design.  (One of my pairs of myodiscs with a power of around -17 has a edge thickness of just 4mm.)  The other major difference of myodiscs is that as there is no full field of view, you lose a portion of peripheral vision and have to turn your head a little more, instead of your eyes.  This can take a little getting used to, but with a large bowl size it wont be very obvious. </p><p> </p><p>As for your other questions regarding your prescription.  This is one of the areas that nobody can really give you an answer, your eyesight may be affected by your pregnancy, it may not, each person is affected individually.  Your prescription may increase after, it has also been known to increase after pregnancy, to reduce down slightly at a later date.  I dont think there is anything you can do other than to visit your opticians soon after, and just do a few self tests, such as looking at an object in the distance now, and checking the same object each week, to see if it is less clear. </p><p> </p><p>I wish you the best of luck with your baby, and hope everything goes well for you. </p><p> </p><p>If you have any other questions just feel free to ask.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>michelle</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2009, 05:12</p><p>Thankyou all for your very helpful feedback, I hadn't expected to get such a great response. </p><p> </p><p>I have worn a variety of frames over the years, several years ago when I was still only -7 I had a pair of rimless glasses but I thought they showed off the thickness of the lenses too much so when I went to get my next glasses I got a hexi metal frame with hi index lenses - the change in thickness was remarkable. My prescription had only gone up to -8.75 in 1 year and there was NO thickness at all to the lenses, lots of my friends were amazed at the result but I didn't find my vision as good in them, I couldn't see the signs at the train station as clearly, nor could I see other things around the edges of the glasses - I don't know why this was but never had a problem before so after a couple of months I couldn't stand it anymore and the optician replaced the lenses with normal ones - this was a lot better. After 6 months I went back for a check up and was represcribed -9.50. I chose some nice Gucci oval gold frames which were rather pricey but worth it and had the normal lenses fitted again, I could see much better with this new prescription and I wondered if he had under prescribed me 9 months before. He suggested I visit him again in 9 months as my prescription had jumped a bit, I was hoping it wouldn't go up, not only for my eyesight reasons, but financial reasons! The last pair had cost me £400 so I didn't want to shell this out again. So last month I visited and got my prescription which both he, and I were suprised at, -12.50. This was a jump of 3 dioptres which was double the jump the previous time. Do you think my next increase will be even higher than this or this was just a freak occurence? I have given up on the lens thickness thing and actually now I've got used to them I don't find it that bad. I bought some open side wide arm hexi's made by Chanel that have nice diamante arms - they look stunning, and so do my lenses. What is the difference between myodiscs and CR39 (I think this is what you called them). How much do you think I will go up in my pregnancy? I am due to give birth end of January. </p><p> </p><p>In answer to one question, I am 29, from the far east and have a healthy diet. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2009, 00:53</p><p>Michellae </p><p> </p><p>Your RX can change during pregnancy which is due to a generally higher level of water retention. This can sometimes affect the eyes as the increased pressure can alter the shape of the eyeball and consequently impact on the RX. </p><p> </p><p>Have you tried rimless frames with a smaller lens. I have these and although my scrip is a lot less than yours, they are very light.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2009, 00:24</p><p>@ Maryn, the RX change during pregnancy can affect different women in different ways, some have been known to have RX increases during pregnancy, others havent changed at all. </p><p> </p><p>@ Rachel and Michellae, I got my first myodiscs at the -15.00 range and dont regret it.  I stick to CR 39 as ive always found it to overall either the same quality or better than high index lenses (depending on the optician, ive moved around a lot) </p><p> </p><p>As for the restrictions of myodiscs, you can get nice large bowl sizes at -12 to -15 range so when i first swapped over I actually didnt notice any real difference (first were about 35 or 40mm bowls if i remember right.) </p><p> </p><p>so thats my 2p, but if you know your going to increase swap over to myodiscs now while you can get the larger bowls and try them out.  Some opticians will try and claim they are specalist lenses and will try and charge more, but 1 or 2 places with their own lab can create them easily for little or no extra cost. </p><p> </p><p>I get mine now through an online supplier, a lot cheaper than normal, but they arent too good at disguising the bowls.  I dont really care much about that any more, everyone's seen me in myo's so dont need to hide them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maryn</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2009, 18:43</p><p>Michaella, not being able to afford hi index lenses, the next best option is plastic, they will be thicker than glasses lenses, also they are much harder to keep clean, as plastic attracts grim and dirt more readily than glass lenses. </p><p>I would suggest the smallest frames possible to suit you, to reduce the size of the lenses in plastic would lighten your glasses on your nose. </p><p> </p><p>You have been silly not to have a 2 year check up on your eyes.  </p><p> </p><p>Its bunkum being pregnant causes a change in your RX. I don,t know how old you are i would have thought your RX will be stable now and you should have little or no change in your RX for a few years to come. </p><p> </p><p>An eye test is a good health check make a point of having your eyes tested every 2 years.

<p><b>Bart</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2009, 07:59</p><p>Hi Rachel, I just read your posts and it seems you got really a good mood in wearing powerful glasses (-14?) beeing abount 16 yo if I'm not wrong. Are you ok with glasses among your friends and expecially boy friends? Despite some teasing I bet you receive more admiring stares than you can only imagine ;)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2009, 04:45</p><p>Michaella. Myodiscs could be an option for you in the future. Usually people start wearing them when their rxs get into the late teens or around -20.00. I believe they are lighter to wear but your vision will be restricted to the little bowls in the centre of the lenses that give you your correction. I'm definitely considering them for the future but not yet because my worse eye is only -14.00 at the moment and I was pushed into getting high index lenses this time by both my mother and the opticial technician at the opticians where I go for my eye-tests. I think if they are nicely set myodiscs could look quite interesting and not too geekish.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2009, 04:35</p><p>Michellae. I agree with you, I think standard lenses give you better vision than high index do. I know it means the lenses are thicker and I suppose heavier but somehow I'm used to that. I presume yours are metal frames if they have nose pads. Plastic frames would be better all round for your rx but if you are pregnant, your optician is probably correct in telling you that you will need another increase pretty soon. Wait till then and then choose some thicker plastic frames that will hide the thickness of the lenses and not feel as heavy on you nose.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2009, 08:20</p><p>Michaella, if you're heading for a period of fairly rapid increase, then expensive high index lenses are a bit of a waste of money since you'll be changing them probably every 6 months for a bit. </p><p> </p><p>With myodiscs you'll have either a line or a circle in the lens that can be disguised by a good optician, and the lens thickness should easily be about half the thickness of your current glasses (depending on how wide the "bowl" or circle is) </p><p> </p><p>It might be worth checking out several opticians because some are better than others at this sort of work.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Charles</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2009, 04:05</p><p>Michaella </p><p> </p><p>If you possibly can, try to get myodisc lenses (known as lenticular lenes in the UK) they will be much lighter, especially in C39. Even with your relatively low prescription, you might well see better with them. Like you, I have always found high index glass less effective.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2009, 16:07</p><p>Michellae, </p><p>It is not unusual for a woman who is myopic and pregnant to have an increase in their Rx.  Regarding heavy lenses, if your frames have nose pads, you might ask if they need anjustment and if the optician has larger nose pads that would spread out the weight over a larger area.  For excellent optical characteristics, it is hard to beat CR-39 in plastic lenses.  Its only disadvantage is that that is has a low index of refraction which translates into higher lens edge thickness than the high index materials.  You might investigate some of the on line retailers for lower cost glasses. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michellae</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2009, 14:12</p><p>I am first time visitor and have found reading this very helpful. I have recently had my prescription increased from -9.50 to -12.50 and find that my lenses are a little heavy on my nose. I cannot unfortunately afford to buy the hi index lenses, plus i have always thought that my vision is better through the normal lenses than the hi index ones erethe optician is always trying to sell me. </p><p> </p><p>As these lenses almost 1.5cm thick and are quite frankly, hurting my nose by the pressure the frames and lenses are pushing onto it, is there anyway someone could suggest if these myodisc lenses would be better and lighter or if there is any other better option? Can you get them at this prescription?  </p><p> </p><p>As I am 6 months pregnant my optician has said that after I give birth my prescription may change as apparently it affect those who are short sighted - is this true or does he want me to just pay for another eye test/go for a check up in a few months?  I have been told i have very dry eyes so I can't wear contacts, please can you help me. Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>russell</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2009, 11:14</p><p>Thanks, Cactus...very interesting.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2009, 10:11</p><p>russell, </p><p>Yes.  A "normal" eyeball is about 25 mm in diameter and the total power of the cornea and the crystaline lens is about +40 diopters with a large portion of that being in the cornea.  Prior to the cataract surgery, I was about -4.50 in my left eye and -2.75 in my right.  The IOLs that replaced my crystaline lenses are L +13.0 and R +16.5.  My current Rx is about L +0.25 and R -1.25 both with some cylinder.  The monovision was intentional so I don't absolutely need to put on my glasses to function. </p><p>I think most opthalmologists will install any reasonable power you want with the understanding that once the rear membrane of the crystaline lens capsule attaches itself to the IOL (usually just a few days), the lens can't be removed and a different power installed.   </p><p>During the surgery, the front of the capsule is removed and the crystaline lens is emulsified by an ultrasonic tool and removed.  The rest of the capsule is left intact to act as a barrier between the vitreous humor inside the eye and the aqueous humor between the cornea and the crystaline lens. </p><p>If later, what is sometimes called a secondary cataract develops because the capsule is trying to grow a new lens, the rear membrane of the capsule is zapped by a laser which vaporizes the central portion of the membrane to restore clear vision.  The procedure is painless, takes only a few minutes, but not much fun.  Once it is done, it lasts for a lifetime.  Because the rear membrane is now bonded to the IOL, the barrier between the humors is still intact </p><p>C.. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>russell</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2009, 08:08</p><p>Cactus: Concerning the IOL that they implant in cataract surgery--does it have prescription in it?  I was wondering if one could get a surgeon to put one in that would require you to wear stronger glasses.  I've heard some people say that after cataract surgery they no longer needed glasses, so I thought perhaps the implant corrected their need for prescription.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sal:</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2009, 11:55</p><p>Cactus: </p><p>Tanks for the suggestion, but I am afraid contacts are not an option for me because of very dry eyes.  I have already tried them on a few occasions.  So, I'll continue with glasses.  I am due for a 6 month check up in Nov, and probably stronger glasses, as the intermediate segment is getting better for distances now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2009, 06:53</p><p>Cookie, </p><p>I can assure you that I was also very scared before the cataract surgery.  I found a very experienced opthalmologist who was willing to discuss the procedure and explain the risks and benefits.  The surgery itself was the nearest thing to a surgical non-event I have experienced.  The removal of the crystaline lens and installation of the IOL was done through a 3 mm incision in the side of my cornea.  It is hard to believe, but the IOL is flexible and will fold up into a tube that can be inserted through the incision.  Your body heat will cause the lens to assume its proper shape once it is ejected from the tube so it can be positioned in the crystaline lens capsule. </p><p>The whole procedure took about 10 to 15 minutes.  The incision was so small that no stitch was required.  My eye was bandaged for protection and I removed the bandage the next morning.  After about an hour, my normal tearing action washed away the antibiotic ointment the doctor had put in my eye.  I removed the lens for that eye from my glasses and drove myself to the doctors office.  He was pleased with the results and my question at that point was, "When can we do the other eye?"  </p><p>I had to wear a plastic shield at night for a week after the surgery to keep from rubbing the eye in my sleep.  My other eye was done two weeks later.  This time, I was not the least bit scared, because I knew what was to happen. </p><p>It is likely, that at 22 your eye growth has slowed significantly, but one thing they can do if it is still growing, is to compensate for that growth and put in lenses that you "grow into".  You will likely still need glasses and some small Rx changes, but that is no big deal.  I have had the IOLs for over 8 years now, and have never regretted the decision for a second. </p><p>C. </p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cookie</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2009, 21:52</p><p>Cactus, thanks again. I will see if I can get some make up glasses and get +18 lenses fitted. I was considered for surgery a few years ago and the doctor said it was not suitable then because my eyes were still growing. Now that I'm older it might be an option. I am scared of the idea of having my eyes cut as I understand infection can be a problem. Maybe trifocals would be the best option for me, I could at least get rid of reading glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2009, 17:03</p><p>Cookie, </p><p>I did a Google search on "make up glasses" and got a number of hits.  That might give you some ideas of what is available.  The available lens powers are probably not adequate for your needs, but a stronger lens could probably be installed.   I suspect you may need a lens in the +18 to +20 range to see the contact clearly on your finger, prior to inserting it. </p><p>The important thing is to find an optician who is willing to experiment and you must be willing to experiment also. </p><p>Some other possibilities that involve surgery are internal contact lenses that are placed between in front of the iris through a 3 mm incision, Starr Surgical makes lenses out of collagen that are inserted behind the iris and in front of the crystaline lens, but these may not be available for significant hyperopia.  Also, at some point, you may be able to consider crystaline lens replacement.  The major disadvantage to lens replacement is that you loose the ability to accommodate, but in your situation, that might not be a major loss, because trifocals are a good substitute. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cookie</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2009, 14:37</p><p>Cactus, thanks for the tip. I will ask my eyecare professional if glasses like you describe are available. It would be great not to have to wear such thick glasses and my vision would be a lot better with contacts. I might even deelop the confidence to learn to drive a car if I had better peripheral vision.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2009, 15:25</p><p>Cookie, </p><p>I can understand that you might have trouble getting them in because you can't focus close without lots of plus help.  I wonder if the "glasses" with the flip over lens that hyperopic ladies use to help with make-up might be useful. </p><p>What ever you do, follow good hygiene and care for the lenses if you can use them. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2009, 15:22</p><p> </p><p>sal and cookie, </p><p> </p><p>can you sent me pictures of your glasses to my email (dsuk124@walla.com) that would be very intersting to see high pluss lenses combined with prisms. </p><p> </p><p>thank you</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>cookie</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2009, 14:57</p><p>Thanks Jack, the telescope effect and lack of peripheral vision get worse as my prescription has increased so GOC might work. I've never worn contacts as I have trouble getting them in. Contacts would also mean thinner glasses and my eyes would be less magnified - I hate having eyes that look like golfballs! Thanks also Sal. I also have readers with a stronger prescription as I've never been able to get used to bifocals and as a student I read a lot and do a lot of computer work (too much if I don't want to go blind).I'm in Australia.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2009, 13:33</p><p>Cookie and Sal, </p><p>One idea you might discuss with your Eye Care Professional (ECP) is to combine contacts and glasses.  The idea is to use soft contacts (maybe aspheric) for a large portion of the high plus sphere and put the rest of the sphere and all of the cylinder and the prism in the glasses.  The optical benefit, if it works, is to minimize the "telescope" effects of high plus lenses when combined with vertex distance.  The result could be improved peripheral vision and perhaps improved depth of field and acuity. </p><p>The above is theoretical and a form of GOC, which might cause the ECP some problems.  Sphere only soft contacts are pretty inexpensive and might help.  The idea is not very different from the idea of using IOLs to replace the crystaline lenses clouded by cataracts instead of high plus lenticulars.  I have had cataract surgery with IOLs and wear trifocals (w/prism) for the final correction to 20/20 or better at all distances. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sal</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2009, 12:45</p><p>Cookie: </p><p>I am surprised about the lenticulars.  My glasses are +10.5 with 13BO in both lenses, no lenticulars.  I also have +14 with 13BO for reading and no lenticulars, just 1-6 high index.  My doctor recommends bifocals for hyperopes over +6, I've worn them since I was 14, I'm 25 now and a graduate student.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cookie</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2009, 17:44</p><p>I also need 12BO correction in my left eye and 4BO in my right, so maybe that's why he said I need lenticulars. I don't need bifocals. The worst thing is how much the lenses magnify my eyes, but I'm told this is just as severe with lenticulars as with hi-index lenses. As my prescription has increased my peripheral vision has declined and I need to look through the centre of the lens  to have the best vision possible. It's not ideal, but I'm glad I can get glasses that will correct my eyesight so well.</p><p></p><hr>

Made by Germany Carl Zeiss laboratories and really expensive... and having conventional over 15 Base Out prisms blocks and some +12:75/13:50 Press On bottom Optical lenses from the same laboratory and adding later, the 35 Prisms as BO Press-On prisms so that it is possible to me to avoid any other eye devices like magnifier or any other stuffs that helps me with f#*@ing... strabismus and the lack of internal lenses thus making it possible that with a single eyeglasses of over + 45 shitty lenses and up to 50 prisms gives me good vision and funny colors sometimes. </p><p>Those glasses seems to help me correcting my strabismus, er... that is what doctors says; that apparently two strabismus surgeries didn't correct. D'you know? I am not complaining even after steam cells treatment that made things worsen... hehe, hehe. But, hopefully one day strabismus will go away and I will have just ordinary eyeglasses if steam cells work fine in future. I hate strabismus even more than being aphakic in the world. </p><p>Now I am 17yo and just one more year and I'll take control of my life. No more school at last and no more bullies ever again but just get a job... and OFF I will be. My eyes will stop getting worst and no need to change glasses ever again, but just ordinary glasses. I will be free at last... YUPPPPIEEE. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2009, 11:31</p><p>R Ed, I first got glasses when I was 8 yesrs old, although I had noticed that I could not see things that other people could. In the beginning, I thought everybody saw what I saw and couldn't see what I couldn't see. When the truth finally dawned on me (by way of a school eye test and I realized I could barely even see the first line!), that was when I finally got glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I switched to contacts when I was 11. I persuaded my parents to get them because I was to be a junior bridesmaid in a wedding and I didn't want to wear glasses for the ceremony! And so I have worn contacts ever since. </p><p> </p><p>:)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>R Ed</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2009, 07:24</p><p>Chrissi, </p><p> </p><p> To clarify, I assume you first needed glasses at a young age, perhaps 6 or 8. I assume this because at 14 you have a double digit correction, so it may have been increasing for some years. At 6 or 8 youngsters would wear glasses rather than contacts. Perhaps at 12 a girl would gain parental approval to switch to contacts. If this scenario is true for you, then your friends would have seen you in glasses although they don't any longer.  </p><p>  Actually you did answer my questions; you friends reacted postively both to you starting to wear glasses and then to your later switch to contacts. You have wonderful friends! </p><p>  Do you recall when you first got glasses, how you knew you needed them and when you switched to contacts. </p><p>  How did you persuade your parents to agree to you wearing contacts?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Like Lenses</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2009, 00:44</p><p> A few posts back there was some discussion about eye exams. </p><p> When looking through the phoropter the optometrist determines the proper Rx for the right eye, and then occludes it and determines the proper Rx for the left eye,she then opens the occluder on the right eye, and I get a strange pulling sensation in the right eye, as it gets used to the newer stronger prescription. Then as she rotates the phoropter away from my eyes after the exam is complete, my eyes feel lost until she hands me back my present glasses, and even then my eyes seem to want the new prescription that they had just been subjected to. </p><p> Does anyone else experience this? </p><p> Before phoropters became so common, my optometrist used a trial frame, and lenses.After arriving at the new Rx, she would often have me walk around the exam room with the trial frame on, and then have me view a near vision chart. I usually had to move it farther away from my eyes to see it clearly. And when picking up the new glasses usually had to hold reading material farther away than with the previous Rx. </p><p> With the trial frame, and lenses, it seemed to be more apparent that your Rx was increasing as the exam proceded. </p><p> On a few exams I have read fine print for several hours prior to the exam, and held the print closer than normal.My eyes felt very fatiqued, and I walked away with stronger glasses, that took a bit of getting used to. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2009, 13:09</p><p>R Ed, I was going to discuss an add with the ophthalmologist that dispensed contacts for me, but I decided that it'd be much easier to discuss this with my regular examiner at the hospital. </p><p>I see my regular ophthalmologist next month.  </p><p>Granted, it is a bit complicated having two examiners... </p><p>I am also going to get another full examination because I think my glasses rx for distance might be off.

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2009, 10:18</p><p>Hey Rachel. That's just the way I feel when I first get new glasses or contacts. Everything is suddenly bright and sharp. It's like everything's newer. </p><p> </p><p>Once, when I got a really big increase, I think I almost jumped 2 diopters, when I first got my glasses, I felt dizzy because it was so overwhelming and so much clearer than the vision I'd been experiencing with my old glasses! The ground seemed so much farther away and everything appeared small but crisp. </p><p>Have you ever had that feeling before?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Danbert</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2009, 09:24</p><p>Rachel: I am curious. You say that the distortion makes you feel that you are really dependent on glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Obviously you are already totally dependent on glasses with a prescription like yours, so I find it interesting that you can feel even more dependent on your glasses when you get an increase. Is this purely psychological do you think or is it a result of increased distortion/minification? </p><p> </p><p>Glad that each increase obviously make you very happy, in any case.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Danbert</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2009, 09:09</p><p>Rachel: Probably true, but as I said, your brain can only make the best of what is made available to it - as your Rx increases, the distortion will also increase as will minification effects, and your brain will have slightly less to work with. </p><p> </p><p>I could easily be wrong. Can anyone comment on what the subjective effect on one's vision is as myopia progresses? </p><p> </p><p>I have read that image minification amounts to approx. 2%/diopter. So, a -10D lens will result in a 20% decrease in image size. This is not a whole lot, but a -20D prescription amounts to 40% which does seem like alot. Can anyone comment on what effect this has on visual acuity?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2009, 05:04</p><p>Danbert. Wow that's brilliant. Thanks. That means when I have my next big increase my peripheral vision shouldn't be too much of a problem once my brain has got used to the extra curve in my lenses. Actually I quite enjoy the distortion. It make me feel kind of really dependent on my glasses. I can't wait for my next big increase.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Danbert</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2009, 04:50</p><p>Rachel: Your brain is what would compensate for the peripheral distortion. Of course, the brain still cannot make something out of nothing and is just creating the best interpretation of the image information available to it. </p><p> </p><p>Just a few other things the brain can do with images that happen to be focused on your retinas: </p><p> </p><p>- The retina transmits an upside-down image, so the brain "flips" it. </p><p>- The brain interpolates (fills in) the blind spot in each eye by combining the images from both eyes. </p><p>- The brain uses images from both eyes to produce a stereoscopic image with depth of field (think of this as a 3d image as opposed to a 2d image). </p><p>- The brain processes what you see, honing in on what is relevant at the time so that you are not overwhelmed by too much information.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2009, 01:43</p><p>Chrissi. BTW. I forgot to mention what it was like when I first walked out of the opticians wearing my new glasses. It was like the sun had suddenly come out, everything look so brilliantly clear and sharp. You know the feeling? The only weird thing was my peripheral vision which seemed a lot more distorted than before. Especially when I got to the shop doorway, it was like it was kind of curvy all round the sides and made me feel slightly dizzy. I seem to have got used to that now though, cos I never seem to notice it at all anymore. That's weird too when you think about it. It must mean my eyes are compensating for it or something like that. It may have been because my increase was more than usual perhaps. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2009, 00:37</p><p>Chrissi. We she started with what I already had, like yours does, and meesed me about for ages before we got up to what I really needed. She kept saying, are you sure that's no better Rachel, and  I kept having to say, only slightly. It made me feel like I was going blind or something. LOL. Then when she got to where she thought I should have been, I had to ask her twice to go up even more. I felt like a total fruit case or something. In the end she prescribed me RE -11.75 and LE -12.50 and when my new glasses were ready for collection they felt really good. But I still got the impression she didn't approve of giving me such a lot more minus. It's strange really. Tell me how you go at your next check-up on this thread.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2009, 00:32</p><p>Chrissie. Last time I went in April I hadn't been for nearly 9 months and I was only on RE-10.25 and LE-11.00. I knew this was nowhere near strong enough because I had been really strugging even at the front of class and my distance vision in town was really bad. Like there was no way I could recognise people on the other side of the street or anything or read the signs over shops. Even sometimes I was getting the bus numbers wrong if I didn't get right up to them. So when my optician asked me if I was having any problems with my current glasses, I said yes, its looks as though I need some much stronger ones. (cont.) </p><p></p><hr>

At 13 it went up to -6.25 &amp; -7.00 and by 14 I was on -7.25 &amp; -8.00 when both times I cheated slightly. My prescription at 15 was -8.25 &amp; -9.00 which gave me some flat-fronted lenses I had been longing for. I had a test six months later, which pushed me to -9.00 and -9.75, then at 16 I achieved -10.25 and -11.00. The in April this year I pushed that up to -11.75 and -12.50 which was really much too big a jump to be honest. It took my eyes a good few weeks to accommodate it.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2009, 15:12</p><p>Gino, </p><p>A pure myope (no astigmatism) has effectively built in reading glasses.  For example, a person with an Rx of -3.00 effectively has a built in +3.00 and would see the same as a person who had perfect vision wearing +3.00 reading glasses. </p><p>You can calculate the distance beyond which thing begin to get blurry by dividing the Rx into 100 cm or 39.37 inches. For example 100 cm divided by 3.00 = 33.3 cm.  Things that are 33 cm or closer would be sharp and clear, beyond than things would get increasingly blurry. </p><p>If they have some astigmatism, it just makes the situation worse. </p><p>If your new friend Lynn has an Rx of -6.00 things beyond about 16.5 cm are pretty blurry. </p><p>If you want to get an idea what her vision is like, try on a pair of +3.00 reading glasses at a store that sells them and then, slip on another pair over them. </p><p>Try not to get caught.   </p><p>If you do get caught, tell them you are very long sighted and you broke your glasses and are trying to find a way to get by until your new glasses are ready. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>minus 5 who luvs gwgs</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2009, 06:24</p><p>I do not know my initial rx probably about minus 1 yes he may have been a gwg fan but with little girls my ex was about 10 years old he was a pervert who as far as I know was not caught the disgusting little creep</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2009, 04:08</p><p>And. Yes but not in my current prescription unfortunately, so I don't tend to wear them all that much. They are ok at a push but around -1.50 too weak for me now. It means I can wear them for getting around but not for anything serious.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2009, 03:15</p><p>Rachel, did you say you also have prescription sunglasses ?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2009, 02:51</p><p>What rx did you start at, can you remember?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>minus 5 who luvs gwgs</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2009, 02:48</p><p>I first wore glasses at age 8 having had a school medical I vaguely remember a previous school eye test where I found it difficult I remember the amazement in suddenly being able to see individual bricks and leaves on trees I did not realise that my eyes had deteriorated though quite why the optometrist did not tell me to wear them all the time we will never know he must have known my myopia would progress he did the same with my first wife who again was myopic from a young age apparently he used to sit young girls on his knee for eye tests he was elderly then so unlikely to be alive now I suspect he was a bit of a pervert </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2009, 02:44</p><p>And. Urm,,,yeah probably these days. I'm scared of not seeing the edge of the pool without. It's ok swimming with glasses on, providing no silly idiot come up and splashed you in the face or something. At least you can see where you are swimming to. Then if you haven't got your glasses, it's hard to find your way back to the locker rooms.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2009, 02:34</p><p>Rachel, what about you, would you leave your glasses on in he pool ?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2009, 02:33</p><p>Clare, with your rx are you happy to swim on holiday bare-eyed or do you leave your lenses in ?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2009, 02:26</p><p>Clare. I'm not really sure to be honest. My mum used to keep telling me if I carried on wearing my glasses such a lot it would make my eyes go a lot worse. That's because that's what happened with her younger sister when she was a kid. She carried on needing stronger and stronger just like me. I think its a matter of being able to see better that really make you do it when you are little. Like I hadn't realised what I was missing when I was 7. I suppose though your eyes may get so used to glasses that it could actually weaken them in the long term. It's a case of weighing up the pros and cons really. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2009, 10:39</p><p>Rachel - interesting that with 1.50 and -1.75 you went fulltime. I wonder whether it's more important (do you think) for children to wear that Rx fulltime than adults? </p><p> </p><p>I know adults that do but never did myself. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2009, 10:32</p><p>Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2009, 10:21</p><p>And: Maybe I will post some of my stories for the Going without thread.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2009, 10:20</p><p>Puffin: As a kindergartener or first grader, perfect vision isn't really needed because those two years most schools let you play or just do close work, like coloring. On the occasion that the teacher did use the board or the overhead, I did realize that I could not see but I thought that was normal. Later on as I grew up, I became frustrated and finally realized that it wasn't normal at all, and so I succumbed to glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Rachel: You are right, that is exactly how I felt.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2009, 05:54</p><p>Puffin. yeah but at only 6 years old Chrissi may not have realised how bad her vision was. She probably thought that what she could see (or coudn't see, as the case happened to be) was normal. It wasn't until I tried another girl's glasses on at school when I was 7 that I realised I actually needed glasses myself. Even then, my Mum thought I only wanted them because this other girl had got some and I wanted to be like her. Then eventually when my teacher suggested to my Mum that she take me to for a proper check-up we discovered I needed -1.50 and -1.75. The difference glasses made to my life was amazing and quite honestly I've never wanted to be without glasses since.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hollie</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2009, 04:15</p><p>Stephan </p><p> </p><p>That does sound pretty crazy- that's almost my rx now, although I have astigmatism as well, and I have to get pretty close to a computer screen without glasses to see it, closer than is practical in most situations! Although I do understand where you are coming from. When I was -3.5 or -4 I couldn't wear contacts for a while but didn't wear glasses all the time. Seems stupid and vain now, considering my eyesight was not great at all. But I still did wear them in lectures etc. I think most people would struggle to read the board at -3 and be found out if they were still at school. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stephan</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2009, 03:55</p><p>for me this is quite normal - I knew that I am pretty nearsighted but first refused to wear glasses or even see a doctor for an eye exame ! This worked out till age of 17 - i wanted to do my driving license but I also knew that I'd never get through the eye exame without glasses... So I created a horriblebad story, went to an eyeglass and contact lens supplier and got my first pair of glasses and contacts : glasses were -5.75 both eyes !!! Today I can't belive that I was a quite good student because I couldnt see the blackboard at all but learnde to close one eye and squint with the other to figure out waht the guy in front is talking about... ;-) Most time I got the neatly handwritten papers of class mates and went to a copy shop to get the stuff I couldn't take from the blackboard. Looking back this sound really crazy to me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2009, 01:53</p><p>I wonder how someone can get to -3 without being discovered at school. You'd struggle to see things like the blackboard unless it were really close.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2009, 01:03</p><p>Chrissi. Wow, I'm not surprised you went fulltime from the start with an rx of -3.00. Glasses must have made an enormous difference to you life even at 6 or 7. Like I said, I started at 7 with -1.50 and -1.75 (I think!) and I noticed how EVERYTHING looked so much clearer. After that I had a check-up every twelve months with reasonably big regular increases, until I got to 14. Since then I've been having them every six months, which make much more sense for myopes like you and me. Even so the increases have continued at much the same rate, which is slightly worrying!! best of luck with your July check-up.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2009, 16:05</p><p>Chrissi, do you have any tales for the 'going without' thread ?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2009, 15:56</p><p>Melyssa, I had needed glasses for quite some time before I had actually gotten them, so no wonder the high starting rx. </p><p>I hadn't realized that I saw the world any different from anybody else until I got glasses and realized my vision was actually quite poor.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2009, 13:24</p><p>Chrissi, </p><p> </p><p>That was quite a starting RX and later jump.  I was at -1.75/-1.50 to begin, and part-time at that, but I didn't really notice anything wrong until my eye exam.  When I was 27, I had a probable 2-diopter jump, maybe to a prescription at or a little more than yours was.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2009, 09:13</p><p>Oh dear, I meant to say "ophthalmologist."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2009, 09:12</p><p>Oops, sorry Rachel, I forgot to answer some of your questions, so I'm back here again. lol </p><p>Yes, I went fulltime from the very start, as my rx was very high and I realized that WHOA, so people don't actually see the world in a blur. What was your first rx? </p><p>I don't know what my rx will be like two years from now. I have an appt scheduled in July and another in August, so I'll keep everybody updated. (The one in July is for contacts fitting and the one in August is for my regular ophthalologist--she doesn't fit contacts.) </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2009, 09:04</p><p>Hello Rachel, I started wearing glasses when I was eight, but I remember squinting to see things when I was in first grade, maybe six or seven. My first rx was quite high, -3 or so. I kept getting very high increases every year, once I went from about -6ish to -8ish. Guess I should've gotten new glasses every six months instead of once a year. You can imagine the crazy squinting I had to pull off!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2009, 22:28</p><p>Chrissi. At the moment I wear glasses all the time but I'm considering contacts. I can't believe your rx is almost as high as mine and you are two years younger. It's amazing isn't it. How old were you when you first got glasses? I was 7 and I went fulltime from the start. Did you? My mother kept telling me not to, but I could see things so much better I just kept them on. How much do you think you will have increased to in another two years time? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2009, 13:59</p><p>Rachel: I wear contacts out and glasses at home. </p><p> </p><p>And: Yes, my rx is undoubtedly still climbing. I am 14.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2009, 12:47</p><p>So that explains why my astigmatism is +3.00 with my wonderful diopters currently at -9.00, as I've worn glasses since age 8.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2009, 09:58</p><p>Spare time optometrist, that sounds right. Most of my increases were between 16 and 25 years old, and during that time is when my left eye got more myopic than my right. I've never gotten a good answer as to why this happens. Any ideas?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>spare time optometrist</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 22:50</p><p>my prescription is -10.50 / -10.50 without astigmatism. I even Know people in the range between -15 and -20 without astigmatism. It depends on the age when most part of the RX was caused - the earlier the more astigmatism.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>And</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 15:45</p><p>Chrissi, is your prescription still increasing ? Have you contributed to the other threads, for example can you remember the last time you were 'going without glasses'</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 14:59</p><p>My prescription is R -12.00, L -15.00 with only -.50 astigmatism in the right eye.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 13:42</p><p>it's rare to have a double figure prescription and no astigmatism.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 13:24</p><p>Chrissi. You are nearly the same as me -11.75 &amp; -12.50 but my astigmatism is higher. It's a pretty high minus prescription all the same. Do you wear glasses fulltime, or have you tried cls?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrissi</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 12:12</p><p>Hello, I'm new to this thread, but I've posted at Post Your Prescription before. </p><p>My rx is -11.25, and I have only very insignificant astigmatism, my doctor says less than -.25.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2009, 10:36</p><p>I got up to -7.50 in both eyes before astigmatism crept (back) in.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>micha</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2009, 16:06</p><p>Does anyone know a substantially nearsighted person with same spherical RX in both eyes and no astigmatism at all? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rachel J</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2009, 22:34</p><p>Like I just said on Going Without Glasses, between -3.00 to -4.00 is the strength that people usually give in at and go fullime wear with glasses. You could still go out of the house without them at those rxs, if you are very careful and stick to certain guide lines, like always using road crossings with lights and taking extra care with steps and things. (The worst thing that usually catches you out is where there is only one step and you simply never see it!) That gives you a shock when you either catch you toe on it or suddenly feel yourself go down it. Then the other big problem is recognizing people at a distance when you are out. You just can't, and have to wait until they get up to you or speak or something. It can be very embarrassing and I often used to wait until I'd been talking to them for a few minutes before I mentioned their name, in case I was wrong. But like I said early, -7.00 is definitely the rx I would class as finally being strong and then into double digits as being very strong.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2009, 15:15</p><p>Being unable to go out of the house without your glasses doesn't necessarily mean that the glasses are 'strong'. </p><p> </p><p>My suggestion: </p><p>Low power: up to -6 </p><p>Medium: -6 to -20 </p><p>High: over -20 </p><p> </p><p>I think the numbers for plus lenses might be lower.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sum1wholovesgirlswithglasses</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2009, 05:33</p><p>I'd say at -5 to -6.my cousins best friend has a prescription of -5,50 and -6,25 when friends or other people try her glasses on their comments were always  like omg theyre very strong your blind as  a bat  or keep asking questions like what things she can't do without corrective lenses,have you ever  considered lasik surgery and so on...  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brooklyn_boy</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2009, 04:42</p><p>And </p><p> </p><p>I'm a -5.50 both eyes and I still get up in the morning and go to wrk without contact lenses or eyeglasses, when I get to wrk, thats when I put my contacts in. I do take a pair of glasses on my bag, one time, there was a problem on the trains and I had no glasses and it was very difficult to find my way to wrk.  But yes, I think at -5.50 I can consider my self helpless without eyeglasses since there are a only a few things that can be done without glasses, like reading our things that can be done close.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Millhouse</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2009, 04:39</p><p>-And. </p><p>-RachelJ </p><p> </p><p>That would included high '+' rex too of course. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2009, 13:56</p><p>Siobhan, with monovision your brain will soon adapt to select the eye offering the best available image for near or far. The other one will be pretty much ignored - so, not blurry. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Siobhan</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2009, 13:35</p><p>I had my checkup at the hospital today. All is well so I will have the second operation in 2 weeks time. </p><p>Over the last few days, I have got more used to the new lens. In fact, I can see well from about 20ft into the distance. This has become better, but I can see less close up without changing to my reading glasses. They are not quite so good as they were at first. The optician in the hospital tested me in various ways. It took about 30 mins. She says that I need a slightly stronger lens for normal wear and also wants to try slightly stronger reading glasses, but won't make changes until after the next operation.  </p><p>She talked about "setting my eyes for monovision". This seems to mean one eye doing close and the other distance, but does it not mean that everything will be blurry? She told me that my distance prescription is +23.5 at present, but may increase slightly as the healing completes. She did not recommend bifocals. </p><p>Sam, have you tried bifocals?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;09 Apr 2009, 18:17</p><p>Siobhan, </p><p> </p><p>That all sounds quite normal for someone who's had a cataract op. The thing is, your flexible-focus lens in your eye has been replaced by a fixed-focus lens in your glasses, thus it can only focus in a limited range of distances - this is why you now have reading glasses, to extend the range of possible focus distances. It sounds like you have been overcorrected a little - this happens, things might change a little as your eye heals and settles. </p><p> </p><p>Typically high hyperopes or cataract surgery patients experience limited and/or distorted peripheral vision - objects will suddenly pop into view unexpectedly. It may be hard to judge distances at first because everything appears closer and bigger. Overall, of course it's not as good as having a natural lens that can change shape etc, but it can be got used to. As below, you could go down the contact lens/readers route.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Siobhan</b>&nbsp;09 Apr 2009, 13:50</p><p>My new glasses and my reading glasses came this morning. I can now read really well, but with the reading glasses on, things more than a few feet away become blurry. With my other glasses on, I see well at between 15 and maybe 35 feet, beyond that and nearer than that things are not sharp. In fact I cannot see much nearer than 10 feet unless i slide my glasses slightly down my nose. Even then that only gives me a few more feet. Things seem to be a funny size, not normal and they only work for objects dead ahead. It's all most confusing. I suppose that's what Terri meant about wearing reading glasses and contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2009, 16:53</p><p>Siobhan, </p><p> </p><p>It may well take a bit of fiddling around with different glasses to get the right strength. The trouble is as this is going on your eye is healing and adjusting too (after all, it has just had an operation). Give yourself a chance to get over it and things to settle, and don't panic, it will be okay.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2009, 15:24</p><p>It's really sad, that your vision is not that good right now, but have you had surgery on both eyes now? I couldn't make it out of your post. </p><p>Because vision with both eyes is always better than with one eye.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Siobhan</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2009, 13:48</p><p>Things are still not going well. I can see very little at all. </p><p>I went to the hospital again this morning and the surgeon was very pleased with my eye. He said it was healing really well. He than passed me to a girl about my age to fit me with a new lense for my R eye. She had a pair of glasses ready with one proper lense and the other frosted. When she put them on, things were still quite blurry though I could make some detail out. She tested me and I could only read the top line of the chart. She then took off the new glasses and did a full test with the usual kit. In the end, I could see down to what she said was 20/40. She was surprised that the prescription was so high. She said that they had measured before and the new pair should have been OK, but I needed nearly 3 points stronger for distance. She then tried me reading and again had to add several lenses, before I could read the paragraph she wanted. </p><p>She then said that she would have to order a new distance pair and a reading pair which I will get at home by courier later this week. I have to  wear them and come back after Easter for another test.  </p><p>She wanted me to go home wearing the temporary pair, though she admitted they were too weak. I could really see little except in the far distance and even that was fuzzy. I  changed back to my old glasses when I got into the car, but I still can't see well anywhere as my left eye is quite blurry and I see nothing with my right. Perhaps the nurses were right and I'll never see much!</p><p></p><hr>

So you will not then have to go about near blind when you've had the surgery on your left eye. </p><p>Then, once you have a new lens for that eye you'll have good vision in both eyes with your glasses.

<p><b>Amanda</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2009, 20:52</p><p> It has been over a month since getting my new glasses,and my reading distance is still at eight inches,and sometimes even closer if my eyes are tired. </p><p> I have been checking my vision with glasses on,at an online eye test site.At first my distance vision was consistently 20/15, and now it is usually 20/20,but on occasion it is 20/30 after a long day of close work. </p><p> I can't tell what my vision without glasses is,as I can't see the chart.When I first got the glasses I could see about four feet but not very clearly,but in just a bit more than a month it has decreased to about a foot. </p><p> I am afraid that when I return in five more months that I will require even stronger glasses. </p><p> An interesting thing happened.About a week ago the screw that holds the left lense in the frame came out at work,and the lense fell out. I was glad that I had my back up glasses, but I was so embarrassed to wear them because they are not high index,and are so thick. Several coworkers said they were cute,but I could tell they were staring at the lenses,and one asked if my eyes had gotten worse already.I felt so bad the rest of the day,and was so relieved to get them repaired at Lenscrafters after work.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Terri</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2009, 13:10</p><p>Hi Siobhan, I'm Terri, Robert's sister. He posted about a month ago about me. </p><p>I developed cataracts when I was 33 and woke up to find that the doctor had decided not to fit an IOL. If I understood him correctly, he said that inside my eye there was too much risk of a blood vessel breaking and had to keep the opening small, so could not fit IOLs. </p><p>I had more of a shock as I did not wear glasses before. When I looked through the first eye after the dressing was removed, I saw nothing but blur and sort of shadow.  </p><p>Even when the first pair of glasses with one lens was fitted, everything looked odd and and distorted. I found it very hard to see for the two weeks between operations. After the second eye was fitted with glasses, things were much easier. They were +16 AND +17 </p><p>It took about a month and several visits to the optician to have the glasses adjusted before I really felt that I could see well in the distance, but had to wear a second pair for up close from the start. I could only see distance as a blur when wearing them. They were +19 and +20. </p><p>Now I wear +15 and +15.50 with an add of +3.5 in glasses, but mostly wear contacts with reading glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Siobhan</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2009, 12:40</p><p>Thank you for all the kind words, but I'm now very worried, because it's my better eye being operated on first. The other does not see as well at all. I wore a patch as a child to "improve" it. </p><p>I have never been able to see anything without glasses and they were stronger when I was a child. My father can't remember the numbers as neither of my parents wore glasses until late in life, but is sure that both eyes were in double figures when I was 8 or 9. </p><p>When I have tried contacts, I was aware that things seemed to be a lot smaller.

And another who had them and they shifted inside her eyes, and had to be removed. Like all operations and procedures, you need to be aware that there is some small chance it might not work quite as intended either in the short or longer term, if your doctor is any good he should have warned you. </p><p> </p><p>Of course we're hoping that everything goes well for you, and also be aware as indicated below, wearing thick glasses is not the end of your attractiveness. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2009, 13:00</p><p>Siobhan </p><p> </p><p>Before implants became popular some years ago, almost all cataract patients had to wear glasses and quite often they were at +20d. So there is no difficulty in making glasses that strong.  In any case, you may not need such a high prescription. </p><p> </p><p>It is true you will not be able to see much without your glasses, and they may take a little getting used to, but you are unlikely to be 'almost blind' with your glasses.  The main change will be that everything will seem rather bigger than you have been used to, and this means that your field of vision will be somewhat reduced.  you will learn to look through the centre of the lens. </p><p> </p><p>I don't know whether it will make you feel any better, but some (many?) of us at this site find ladies wearing glasses like that very attractive indeed. </p><p> </p><p>We all wish you good luck.

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2009, 12:48</p><p>Applying eye shadow has not been too easy a task for me over the years with my -9.00's, but when I do, I slide my glasses down my nose, lean over the sink as close to the bathroom mirror as possible, tell my husband to make sure I don't fall over (just kidding), and apply said makeup.  At least with regular makeup and lipstick, I can wear my glasses -- although the drop-temples may have to be moved a bit for makeup.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sis</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2009, 03:26</p><p>Hi Amanda! </p><p>I too think it is quite a challenge to put on eyemakeup. </p><p>My glasses are L:-7, R:-5 add 2,25.  </p><p>I usually wear contacts, but with the contacts in I can't see well enough up close to put on makeup, so I usually do it before putting in the contacts with my nose almost touching the mirror (and my husband laughing in the background). </p><p>If I need to adjust the makeup before going out in the evening, I usually take the contacts out.

<p><b>Amanda</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2009, 21:21</p><p> I am wondering how other women here handle applying their eye make up.  </p><p> Since getting my glasses, and not able to see close up without them,I guess due to the astigmatism. I have found the only way I can do my eyes, is to fold the left ear piece in, and hold the left lense in front of the right eye, and then apply make up to the left eye, and then do the reverse to make up the right eye. </p><p> Since my lenses are pretty strong, I usually don't use any eye make up during the day, as it is not very noticable through the lenses. I do however like to make my eyes up for going out evenings.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>TONY</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2009, 14:47</p><p>Hi Amanda! what happened to you i guess it`s normal cause your eyes get used to see the prints close very well like you`ve wearing a magnified glass, so when you wear your glasses ,the prints get smaller, don`t worry about it, just in case wait till next exam to see if it get better or not, but in a couple of weeks i guess you`ll be reading fine, i try to made a conexion on the back of the tv and can`t see clear where`s video and audio, but take my glasses off and i see it well, bifocals can be a problem for long vision, so you must wait till next exam, keep in contact, have a great time, hope you`re enjoying new glasses and great vision... </p><p></p><hr>

Terms like that are what cause people on this site to laugh because they are so inaccurately describe what you want to do. </p><p>It sounds to me like you would simply like to wear glasses.  It is very easy to do and can be very inexpensive, and we can advise you what and how to do it. </p><p>Because of the close work you do, I believe getting -3 or stronger glasses, as suggested by DWV, might be a little strong to start with.  You might be able to work your way up to those levels with out too much discomfort. </p><p>You have a bit to learn about vision, optics, and glasses so you understand what you are doing, but I doubt you will find it very difficult.  We should move the discussion to the Inducing Myopia thread or if you would like, you can contact me privately at cactusjack1928@hotmail.com where we can chat more efficiently than here. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2009, 03:10</p><p>Amanda </p><p> </p><p>I think you should let your prescription settle for a few months until your next eye exam before you think about changing to contacts, bifocals, etc. </p><p> </p><p>You will find that reading at first will be a little strange and things look smaller but after constant wear for a few weeks, your brain will automatically accept the new 'smaller' image as  right size and so there will be apparent difference. </p><p> </p><p>The main thing is can you actually read small print, especially in poor light, or is it just the size thing? </p><p> </p><p>If you cannot read in poor light/small print, bifocals may well be the answer, either bifocal glasses or contacts. </p><p> </p><p>With your -1.00 cyllinder correction for astigmatism, distance and reading will be more difficult without correction. Toric contact lenses can correct astigmatism but are often not successful as they need to be exactly positioned on the eye to work and are not available as bifocals. </p><p> </p><p>Ordinary bifocal contacts are very good but you still may need glasses for really good ditance wear and reading. Bifocal glasses will of course provide the solution for reading and distance. </p><p> </p><p>As I said, give it a few weeks, see how with fulltime wear you find reading, check the results at your next eye exam, and then think about the best way forward.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DWV</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2009, 02:30</p><p>Well, you're probably too old to induce any real myopia.  However, you should have enough accommodation to wear fairly strong glasses for shortsightedness.  Try ordering cheap pairs online in powers of -3, -5, -7 and see how much you can tolerate.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Like Lenses</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2009, 02:11</p><p>Amanda </p><p> Regarding your concern about your reading distance. Sometimes a doctor will over correct , or give you glasses that are slightly stronger than what you actually need at the time. This is done so that in a month or so you will not be under corrected, as your eyes get used to the new glasses. </p><p> You most likely will be reading at 14 inches or so in a few weeks. </p><p> The minus lenses make everything appear smaller, and you were previously reading very close with your old glasses, so it is somewhat of a habit. </p><p> You should try to push the reading material farther back, as it is not a good habit to read close with strong minus lenses. </p><p> You have had a very significant increase in your lenses, so you will need to work hard to break this habit. </p><p> Taking frequent breaks from close work is very good, continue to do it. </p><p> Many doctors feel this can slow down the progression of myopia. However the strength of your glasses will increase over the next few years. Some feel that wearing bifocals can slow myopia progression.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2009, 21:52</p><p>Glasses lovers, </p><p>Poor nutrition, such as not eating your vegetables will not particularly affect your vision, but it can cause other serious health problems. </p><p>A person does not wear glasses or other vision correction because their eyes are "weak".  They wear them to correct refractive errors that keep them from seeing clearly.  Fundamentally, it is the same problem as a camera that is out of focus. </p><p>While it might be possible, no ethical doctor will do lasik or any other surgery on a person to make their vision worse. </p><p>It is not possible to cause or induce hyperopia (far or long sightedness) which is corrected by wearing plus glasses.  In some instances, it is possible to induce some myopia (near or short sightedness) which is corrected by minus glasses, but the degree of success depends on a number of factors. </p><p>The factors include: age, genetic makeup, motivation, and your visual environment. </p><p>May I ask your age, where you live, and your occupation.?

<p><b>Amanda</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2009, 19:42</p><p> One other thing that happened today.I took my glasses off for a moment to pull my hoodie over my head, and then went to put my shoes on. I couldn't see my feet clearly enough to tie my shoes, and felt an urgent need for my glasses. Since getting them,I have put them on as soon as I awake, and only remove them for a shower,and then put them right back on again,and they stay on till bed time.When they are off I can't see much beyond about four feet. I guess that my eyes have adapted to the glasses, as I believe that my vision without glasses before wasn't this bad. However with them, I can see very well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amanda</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2009, 19:22</p><p>  Thank all of you for the kind responses. </p><p>  The two pair of online glasses that were on order arrived today. I am not happy with the look of the back up pair. I ordered a semi rimless frame,and that was a mistake. The outer edges of the lenses are about 5/16" thick, and just look so strong,compared to my regular pair with the high index lenses. I had originally thought that I could alternate wearing these, but I will only keep them in my purse as a back up pair. Optically they are fine,but when I see myself in a mirror with them on, it suddenly makes me realize how myopic I have become, and that makes me sad.I used to feel bad for anyone that wore thick glasses, and now am am one of those people. </p><p> I will most likely wear the sun glasses, as even though the lenses are as thick,they are not as noticeable due to the tint, and plastic frame style.The sun really bothers my eyes since getting these stronger glasses.I never needed to or liked wearing sun glasses, but that also has changed. </p><p> Someone mentioned that I may need bifocals because I have to read so close up. I hope that is not the case,as that would be almost too much to handle with this whole glasses thing. </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daffy</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2009, 17:35</p><p>In Australia they still sell the glass coke bottles. They stopped for a few years and brought it back. Long live the glass bottles and the term "coke bottle" glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2009, 17:31</p><p> </p><p>Amanda: </p><p> </p><p>Over time you should adjust to a normal distance for reading, but if you don't, you might ask your optometrist if you might benefit from bifocal lenses.  You're way too young to be suffering from presbyopia, but shouldn't be suffering from tired eyes.  Also, don't worry about "Coke bottle" glasses at your level of prescription and even with the CR-39 lenses.  Charles and I who have extremely high myopic prescriptions can assure you of that.  Back in the old days before high-index lenses, high prescription glasses really did look the bottoms of Coke bottles since they could be so thick, heavy and difficult to wear.  Query:  Does Coke still come in those classic 6 oz. glass bottles?  I don't think it does and maybe that's why you haven't heard the expression. </p><p> </p><p>It sounds like your myopia is bound to increase a bit more and if you don't like the look of the CR-39, you always have an option that older myopes didn't have.  Also, you should get used to not seeing well without correction and should lose any moments of panic that you may experience.  You simply developed so much myopia so quickly that you haven't fully got used to not seeing well without correction and haven't got used to the major visual difference you are experiencing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Thor</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2009, 06:28</p><p>Amanda,  </p><p> </p><p>My glasses are -7 and the lenses are CR-39 material and are only about 6 millimetres thick on the edges. The last pair I got, I asked for the lens edges to be polished. The thickness isn't quite as notable then, but I still get stares from folks. Once you get used to the new glasses, you will probably not think too much about any concerns and just be happy to see clearly. For me, I can hardly remember not wearing glasses; it's a learning curve at first though I'm sure. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2009, 01:49</p><p>Amanda </p><p> </p><p>I shouldn't worry too much. The blanks on e-bay are firstly for a stronger prescription, and secondly blanks are very large and made to be used for the largest lens people normally want. </p><p> </p><p>The smaller the lens, the thinner at its outer edge it gets, so unless you have ordered a pair of hugh aviator style glasses, yours will be a lot thinner. </p><p> </p><p>With sunglasses, the darkened lens will hide any element of thickness in any case. </p><p> </p><p>Don't be too concerned and let us know how you get on. </p><p> </p><p>By the way I did mention my glasses are nearly the same prescription as yours. I bought on the net some frameless glasses with thin lenses (not the ultra thin ones) and they are only about 4/5mm thick at the edge.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amanda</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2009, 22:49</p><p>Tony </p><p> Thank you for asking about my progress with my new glasses. I am doing fine with them, except that I still have to hold reading material about eight inches from my glasses to see it clearly. Any farther than this, the print looks too small, and is uncomfortable.I called the doctor about this, and he said that it will not hurt my eyes, and that I should just read where it is comfortable. Working on the computer is fine, most likely due to the extra brightness.I do take frequent breaks from close work, but at the end of a day of it, my eyes really feel tired. That never happened before I started wearing glasses. </p><p> The doctor said that because there is such a difference between my old, and new prescription, that these symptoms are common, and that at my next exam. he could adjust the prescription. I don't like the sound of that, as it sounds like even stronger glasses next time, and that is in six months.  </p><p> I live in the U.S. </p><p>Likelenses </p><p> Wow ! I guess that is what marsh calls coke bottles. </p><p> You do however have me concerned, as a few days ago I placed an online order for another pair of glasses to use in case something happened to this pair, and also ordered a pair of prescription sunglasses. To save some money, I ordered both pair with CR39 plastic lenses. I will be horrified if the lenses look like those you posted. Do you think they will?</p><p></p><hr>

A lot can depend on what other problems are present with myopia or, for that matter, any other aberration of the eye.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>marsh</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2009, 07:43</p><p>FOR EVERYONE,  Does anyone agree with me.  If you have even a -10 or greater, and get other complications which usually happens, your glasses really dont correct anymore, they are just there for you to function. No sharp images as in beginning.  Many times I've been to movies with friends and only the first few rows are good.  I can handle that.  If you could be a -4 or -5, I wouldnt even wear them.\ - WHAT ABOUT YOU - FOR HIGH MYOPIA MEMBERS ONLY - RESPONSES??</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>marsh</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2009, 04:34</p><p>No Amanda, I dont have lasik, you shouldn't either.  I'm almost 60 and I do not want any more operations.  Any proceedure is dangerous and risky, not rosy as advertized.  Be thankful you can see.  I've worn strong glasses since 7, when other kids would look at you.  Being very nearsighted led to early cataracts, then lasers, then 10 years later when vision was distorted and blurred, drs were afraid to operate on retina because of long nearsighted eye shape having large total failure. Post result was 20/80 now better, but inflammation, and I have questions on whether permanent drops to control it will cause more problems. Drs dont even really know. </p><p>  Yeah, if I was only -5 I'd not care if I wore glasses or not. Your #20/600 is much worse that -5, recheck it.   What are you taking up?  You will be fine, keep in touch,  ciao, Marsh</p><p></p><hr>

Although I can see clearly, my judgement of objects is a little off.Reading is clear, but I seem to need to hold the material closer as the print appears so tiny. </p><p> Although they are not that thick,when I look in the mirror, they look pretty strong. </p><p> My doctor stressed today, that I need to take frequent breaks, and look into the distance,when reading, or doing other close work. He also said to hold reading material as far  as possible. </p><p> I have had the glasses on now for several hours and they are comfortable, and my vision is so good with them. </p><p></p><hr>

They are fitted to flex using the muscles in the eye.  I saw this on a local cable show where I live.  A doctor from one the leading optical/surgery groups in my city was explaining several varieties of the lenses and the way each worked. </p><p> </p><p>It is possible to be undercorrected as well. There was a lady on this forum about a year ago that said she did a lot of intricate close work in her job.  Her lenses were replaced to leave her with -5.00 vision.

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2009, 02:46</p><p>Phil, if you're a candidate for IOLs, then you will get your current presription in the implant, so that you don't need any glasses anymore. You're -4 now. If your lenses would be replaced they would be +8 instead of the +12 which your lens is now. Then you had best distance vision. </p><p> </p><p>The lens implants can't accomodate like the human lens can.

<p><b>dave</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2009, 09:15</p><p>Amanda, </p><p> </p><p>Read this from the British Journal of Ophthalmology.  It speaks to the causes of myopia.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2009, 05:25</p><p>I think you should immediately change your eye-doctor. It has _absolutely no_ affect on the growth of the eye if you do close work or something that needs distance-vision. The only difference is the strain of the muscle that moves the lens in the eye. Also glasses do not change the growth of the eye. That is just as stupid to think as that your legs get shorter when you stand for a long time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2009, 01:28</p><p>Amanda </p><p> </p><p>Hello Amanda, I hope you have found all the comments useful, many people here have a lot of experience especially our resident expert Cactus Jack, who I'm sure will post a comment soon. </p><p> </p><p>I understand your concern because by any measure, an increase of -6.00 is a very big jump. The actual physics of the matter means your eyeball is becoming increasingly elongated, rather like a rugby ball on its side, and focussing more short of the retina. </p><p> </p><p>How and why this is happening at such a rate is difficult to say, many years ago I heard the term 'galloping myopia', meaning a short rapid increase in myopia, but don't know how much credibility to give this. Did your eye doctor test the pressure within the eye and was this ok?  </p><p> </p><p>Are you in the UK? If you are and not too far from London, you could vist your GP and ask for a referral to Moorfields eye hospital. They are truely the experts and would be able to put your mind at rest and establish a cause. Moorfields are the best but referral to any other hospital opthamology department would also be able to help. </p><p> </p><p>I am sure everything will be alright and things will stabilise, let un know how you get on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amanda</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2009, 23:46</p><p>To all,  </p><p> Thank you for your info., and concerns. </p><p> I guess that I am having a hard time understanding how I had excellent vision up to this point. </p><p> All through the demands of college, my vision was 20/20, and now to have such blurred vision is very concerning.  </p><p> When I think on the bright side, no pun intended, the vision in the doctors office with the -7.25 glasses at least gives me normal vision, and hopefully they will be much less than -7.25. </p><p> But it is still hard to accept that I am going from needing glasses only for night driving to full time wear, and dependence on strong glasses. </p><p>       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amanda</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2009, 23:22</p><p>guest, </p><p> Thank you for the info. One thing that you said is of particular interest.That is the part about prescribing glasses in the light , verses dark. The reason I went to the opthmologist three years ago was because I was not seeing well at night. When he prescribed the -1.00 glasses it was in a totally dark room, and he seemed to even dim the eye chart. When I first got the glasses they were excellent for night driving, but seemed too strong during the day. I only wore them for night driving. </p><p> Then when the close work began to take a toll on my vision, I started to wear them for work. </p><p> I work as a proof reader, and when not working, do a lot of reading. The doctor suggested that I find some outdoor activity that I enjoy that requires distant vision.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cut-in UK</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2009, 13:52</p><p>Amanda, welcome. </p><p> </p><p>Dieter is right and particularly, at your age, wearing other persons glasses, in the short term, will NOT harm your vision. That is because, at 25 you can usually accommodate the difference of two or even three dioptres. However, it IS an alarming and exceptional increase in three years. Many here WILL be envious as they would wish for increased myopia (particularly) and you have to understand that, the desire for a strong prescription, is a common view among 'eyescene' contributors. If we assume that you are not an optic obsessive, you will not, at first glance, understand that desire. </p><p>My recommendation is that you 'go with it' on the basis that it something you cannot alter. Even -5.00, let alone -7.00, is into fairly high myopia, and will mean full-time wear. I, myself do GOC at -7.00 and feel perfectly at home with it. It is neither extreme, nor impossible to live with. Uncorrected, life is a blur, but you can get to the bathroom and crystal-clear vision is only a foot away on the nightstand. A stylish pair of frames will, you will find, be an enhancement to your persona,and will make life very tolerable. Seeing clearly is a 'must' so join the growing numbers of young women who wear their glasses with pride, and turn heads !</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2009, 08:08</p><p>Amanda, </p><p> </p><p>First of all, please disregard the statements of Duh.  The eyescene forum is quite inclusive and you have come to the right place  at least a good place to get started with your questions.  You will find that we share similar concerns, interests, and a worthwhile amount of knowledge.  Some of us would be considered fetishists that enjoy eyewear, maladies of the eye, and dependencies.  Duh was referring to that.  Not everyone that exchanges comments on this forum shares that enjoyment. </p><p> </p><p>As you have already heard from a few comments, it is not entirely unusual to experience an increase in myopia especially in your early twenties.  Take some time to read through some of these threads and you will see some similar situations.  You would be particularly interested to read the recent concerns of Bryony on the Vision thread.  Her experience is very similar to yours both in age and amount of script progression.  I personally experienced a myopic increase in my early thirties when I changed careers.  I began to work at a computer screen throughout the day and feel certain this had some affect.  At that point I progressed from wearing a mild prescription occasionally to full time wear and dependence. </p><p> </p><p>I am particularly concerned about some of the comments that your eye doctor made.  Everyone who is myopic is predisposed.  Most experts feel it is inherited.  I also dont agree with his statements that you hastened the increase by using your glasses as you did or waiting three years between exams.  It seems rather obvious that you could not see well without them so you wore them.  Thats what glasses are for and a -1.00 script is not likely to cause accommodation problems at your age. </p><p> </p><p>I would like to hear comments from some of our resident experts on this subject such as Cactus Jack.  I have never heard an eye doc throw so many terms such as night myopia, pseudo myopia, etc. at one patient or prescribe eye drops to alleviate the pseudo myopia.  It seems as though he is placing blame towards you for becoming more nearsighted simply because you used your glasses. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2009, 06:36</p><p>Hi Amanda, i have a case similar to you, i noticed that my vision get worse and never wear glasses in my life but in about one year of bad vision i decided to go to the eye doc, she told me i have myopia and my rx`s -2,75 -3,25, like the rx it`s quite high for a first prescription she told me to back in 3 months, thing that i will do in two weeks, i guess my vision it`s very well right now but i`ll go anyway to know what she say, maybe your myopia increase little by little, and as you work all day in computers don`t notice till you see the blur that you notice right now, when you get your new glasses everything will get sharper,i get used to my glasses very quikly,i ask you something, with that aprox rx for your security please don`t drive, let me know how are you these days, take care. TONY</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2009, 04:39</p><p>The glasses were not really overcorrected. The measurements of prescription in a bright environment are not 100% correct because the pupils are narrower and therefore the depth of field is bigger. In darkness, the pupils are wider and when you test again the prescription will be less (with myopia actually more, because it already is in the negative area). That is the problem with most measurements. The difference is approximately 0.25-0.50 dpt, which is enough to give you starbursts around lights in the dark which can be very irritating. </p><p> </p><p>"a terrible strain" is nonsence, too. In your age you could easily compensate this 1 dpt, but it's more strain than without the glasses, though.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amanda</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2009, 21:23</p><p> Thank you all for the information. </p><p> Duh, I don't understand why you would wish that my, or anyone elses vision would get worse. </p><p> guest,The explanation that was given to me by the doctor is that when he prescribed my first glasses for driving that they were an over correction because of what he termed night myopia, and he feels that I put a terrible strain on my accomodation by wearing them for close work. He said I was predisposed for myopia, but that I hastened it by wearing the glasses for close work,and waiting so long between exams.You are correct that I presently do not see well at all, even wearing the glasses full time. However the drops that I have been putting in my eyes seems to have improved vision a bit, but I am sure that my glasses prescribed next week will be much stronger. He told me not to drive until I get my new glasses. </p><p> I guess I don't mind having to wear strong glasses, but I worry how bad my vision may become, and how it will be to be so dependent on lenses, whether they be glasses, or contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy MCNasty</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2009, 13:31</p><p>Guest:  Do you have support for that statement?  I didn't think that the applicable literature supported such an assertion.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2009, 07:40</p><p>The statement, that myopia increases faster when using the glasses for close distances is totally nonsence. Glasses (or any other correction) don't affect the growing of the eye. </p><p> </p><p>Such a big change in prescription as in your case is very umcommon and i think that the measurement was wrong.

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2009, 07:33</p><p>Hi Amanda </p><p> </p><p>My wife went through a similar increase, though not that fast. About 3.5 years ago, at 32 years of age she started having problems when driving at night, and I also noticed she started squinting when watching TV. She went for an eye exam and got glasses with -1.50 in each eye. The optometrist thought she must have had already vision problems for about 1-2 years then as the prescription was not that light for a first pair of glasses. </p><p> </p><p>She always wore the glasses for driving (out of a safety concern) and also auite a bit when working (computer all day long), and sometimes also at the movies or when watching TV, but only when she felt like she needed them. Still, after about 6 months her vision was not perfect any more, even with the glasses on, and she went for a new eye test that confirmed her feeling. </p><p> </p><p>Now, 3 years later, she has -4.00L and -4.50R, which means she cannot function any more without glasses. It´s only when on the beach or at a swimming pool that she goes without them, but then she is really struggling. Her optometrist thinks that (noz she´s 35 years old) her vision has stabilized and she will most likely end up with a -5.00 correction maximum.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amanda</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2009, 02:06</p><p> I found this site, while researching  myopia, and thought that someone may have info. </p><p> I was prescribed glasses three years ago at age 22. The prescription is -1.00 for both eyes. They were mainly for driving,and I was advised to not use them for near work. </p><p> About a year ago I started a new job that required a lot of reading, and computer work for 8 hours a day. I found this work to give me blurred vision, so started to use the glasses for near work, and driving. After about 6 months I found all distances very blurred,even with the glasses, and have to wear the glasses to read, and then have to hold the work about 4 inches from my eyes. </p><p> I just returned from an eye exam, and the doctor said that my myopia has increased, but could not determine exactly how much as there is some pseudomyopia. He gave me some eye drops to use, for a week, and will reexamine my eyes then. </p><p> The best vision I had during the exam, was with -7.25 lenses, but he thinks that my actual prescription will be about -5.50. </p><p> Has anyone had such a large change in vision in that short a time. </p><p> He mentioned that I may have hastened the increase by wearing the glasses for close work, but that I will defininatly need to wear the new glasses for near, and distance. </p><p> He also said that I need to rest my eyes by looking into the distance, every ten minutes while doing close work, and even then, that my prescription will increase at the next exam. </p><p> I am concerned about how bad my eyes have become , and how thick the new glasses will be.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2009, 05:41</p><p>JD, </p><p>With an Rx this high, EVERYTHING affects the accuracy.  For example, vertex distance of the glasses affects the amount of correction by about 3 diopters per mm and I suspect the curvature of her retinas is anything but spherical so the distance from her crystaline lenses is quite variable. </p><p>I suspect that rather than stacking strong lenses in a trial frame a simpler solution would be to use a lens holder that fits over the lenses in her regular glasses and holds lenses from a trial lens set.  That way the vertex distance of the primary lens would be "fixed".  The power of the lenses from the trial set would be relatively small and the vertex distance of those lenses would likely be insignificant. </p><p>Unfortunately, with that degree of myopia, I suspect here eyeballs are extremely elongated and that she also has severe retinal problems and she is grateful for any vision at all. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

Misiak met her recently in High Tatras (Vysoke Tatry) mountains in Slovakia. Her prescription is OD -52D OS -53D.

I met someone who told me he wore  contacts and glasses so his glasses did not have to be so heavy and it worked for him.  </p><p>How thick have your lenses become at the centers?

Sniff. </p><p> </p><p>Even getting new glasses are becoming hard chores to my daddy. Fortunately were getting actual glasses prescriptions from those good guys at UCLA from Los Angles CA, USA. And I realize they can not be crafted that good here in Brazil, "unless" they are outdated AND real ugly and heavy. </p><p> </p><p>And actually... I know the difference between hypermetropia and Myopia, I mean, the + and -, as last year my daddy gave to a little girl back from visiting the northwest of Brazil during Rally dos Sertões", a glasses with a -25:00 or something and I handed those glasses myself. And I asked about them to a doctor at the occasion. </p><p> </p><p>This Year I going back to L.A and I will asked again about those "+" and "-" but I am almost sure, my glasses are something about +29:00 add +37:00. </p><p> </p><p>I am sorry I didnt make myself clear, but my English is really bad, so you have to forgive me. </p><p> </p><p>Anderson... </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Highmyope</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2008, 17:40</p><p>I've seen an online contact lens catalog containing one brand of lens that was offered in powers from +50 to -75 (!). </p><p> </p><p>Regarding glasses--I once worked as an optical lab tech, and our lens catalog included one lens that could be made as strong as -50 (though, from various chatter on this board, it sounds as though somewhat stronger lenses might be do-able). </p><p> </p><p>But yes, I'm very curious to get a definitve answer here, too.

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2008, 17:01</p><p>Cactus Jack, or anyone here. What is the highest myopia you have heard of? Not GOC, but the real thing.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2008, 16:50</p><p>Sally, </p><p>There are several reasons people hold things close to read, myopia is only one. </p><p>Considering pure myopia only, a person who has to hold something at 15 cm to see it clearly would need 100 cm/15 cm = 6.67 or -6.75 to -7.00 glasses. </p><p>100 cm / 18 cm = 5.55 or -5.75 to -6.00 glasses.

<p><b>Sally</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2008, 16:42</p><p>Today I twice saw people reading things from a very short distance. One was probably a student and the other was a waitress. The first had a book less than 15cm from her eyes and the second was writing an order with her eyes maybe 18cm from her pad. Obviously both were quite short sighted. Is it possible to predict what their Rx should be? As my own sight got worse the thing I really noticed was that, without my glasses, I had to bring things closer and closer to my eyes, until it became impossible to read anything using both eyes. Now all I can manage to read without glasses or lenses is my watch.</p><p></p><hr>

And I think that I've worn glasses with every kind of high index lenses available (even glass), and I never found any of those lenses to give me vision as good as I get with CR39 lenses. Since my PD is 64mm (32mm/32mm), even with 56 x 18 metal frames, the decentration of my lenses is only 5mm, which is not a problem as long as I stick with myodisc lenses.

I ran away from that Orphanage after my 5th anniversary and lived in streets for nearly two years </p><p> </p><p>When I went to a doctor because of a tree accident, they found it was a miracle I survived in streets as my problem was serious bilateral Ambliopya due severe farsighted and ocular muscles palsies that included both External Lateral Rectus, if that is the right name, adding to a suspect of Bilateral Duane Syndrome, thou I dont show any head turning or thing like that but just a head thrust so that I could move my eyes from left to right, blah, blah, blah . </p><p> </p><p>After that Ive been into three other eyes surgeries all related to strabismus and defective internal cristalino, if that is the correct name, that is almost flat and is paralyzed, just like my ciliarys and others eyes muscle.  </p><p> </p><p>Recently, that is last year; Ive been considered Low Vision after Ive said I do have CVI or Cortical Visual Impairment, and I really hate those two terms, by those guys at UCLA, those same guys Im ready to meet next  Wednesday, 11th day. But oddly enough, I am very anxious to meet them, because I am experiencing things Id felt only when going to Eye therapy or not having my glasses at home or when Im real tired or else, like dizziness, nausea, head aching and the world looking funny. </p><p> </p><p>Im telling you this all, because I like the support from you and because something real bad has happened to me couple months ago and I am really scared about future. Right now, Im  kind off, enjoying Floridas sun till tomorrow, then there will be two hard weeks ahead. but I hope they can fix or fit my eyes better. </p><p> </p><p>Thanx for listening.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>PS: Tortoise, sometime due to eyes issue defects, artificial implant lenses can not be applied after cataract surgery, just like me, thou I could not have my internal lenses removed. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2007, 19:15</p><p>Leo, I'm wondering why you did not get the artificial lenses implanted with your cataract surgery.

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;29 May 2007, 04:16</p><p>Sally, </p><p> </p><p>Generally, vision is supposed to stabilize when a person is in his/her mid-to-late 20's, although heredity does play a not-so-minor part in determining when.

<p><b>Cactus jack</b>&nbsp;27 May 2007, 12:16</p><p>Sally, </p><p>No one knows the exact cause of progressive myopia or when it will stop.  However, there appears to be a biochemical/genetic link for both extreme farsightedness and nearsightedness. In the case of farsightedness the eyeball does not grow properly and in the case of nearsightedness, it grows too much. The controlling factor may be a chemical produced by the retina. </p><p>Here is a link to an article about some research at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Mayland that may be of interest.  I have not seen anything about this research since the article appeared, but it might be worth looking into. </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731005509/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/08/050824080218.htm" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/08/050824080218.htm</a> </p><p>There was also some emperical findings out of Australia that seemed to suggest that undercorrection of myopia and unclear peripherial vision may stimulate increases in myopia.  I had a link, but it no longer works. One of the advantages of a contact or an implant (in my previous post) is that the lens is closer to ideal location than glasses which should improve peripheral vision. </p><p>May I ask where you live? State/Province and Country only, please. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sally</b>&nbsp;27 May 2007, 11:31</p><p>Thanks guys. That's much more encouraging. I certainly know the 'glasess slipping' problem, and it got worse with every increase in prescription, but my new glasses are really light and it doesn't seem so bad. Bit worried that my sight might get worse until I'm 30. I'm only 19 now, and I was hoping that the increases would stop before I'm 25. How high could it get? Will I also have to wear lenticular glasses?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glenn</b>&nbsp;26 May 2007, 14:53</p><p> Sally, My girlfriend wear -20 and cannot  have surgury .Even though her glasses are quite thick she is able to adjust and sees ok.She still drives but not much at night. Her biggest problem is keeping her glasses in place when she wears her dress glasses. Her work and sport glasses are ok lokking but she likes to wear more tylish frames out socially .These frames keep slipping and if her glasses fall off she is blinded.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Charles</b>&nbsp;26 May 2007, 09:45</p><p>Sally, </p><p> </p><p>I had a similar problem when my prescription reached a similar level to yours. I found, just as my consultant said it would, that quite soon the problem disappeared. Something to do with the brain compensating. I had no problem driving or with any other aspect of peripheral vision.That was a long time ago and I now, with a much higher rx, wear lenticular lenses (myodiscs in the US) and, sadly, can no longer drive because my corrected vision is only 6/24. If I were you, I don't think I would be too worried. I imagine that you are relatively young and that, like most people, your myopia will probably stabilise before you are thirty.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sally</b>&nbsp;25 May 2007, 15:55</p><p>My lenses are flat at the front. I once had the ones that are dished-in at the front, but didn't liked them and got hi-index lenses, but that was a long time ago. Thanks for the advice everyone. News doesn't seem good. Looks like I'll have to get used to not driving, at least at night; either that or getting implants. It might seem strange, but I don't even know what I'd look like without glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;25 May 2007, 06:07</p><p>Sally, </p><p>You might want to visit the Staar Surgical website at www.staar.com.  Staar makes a foldable implantable lens that can be inserted and removed (if necessary) through a tiny incision in the side of the cornea. </p><p>By correcting the refractive error near the source of the problem, distortion is minimal and the field of vision is maximized.  An implantable lens might not correct all your problems, but it could make your Rx low if you still needed glasses. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GOCer</b>&nbsp;25 May 2007, 05:30</p><p>Sally, are your new glasses biconcave?  At the -18 and -20 strength, I have found that plano fronts offer almost normal vision in the entire peripheral range (doesn't even matter if they are high index or not).  Biconcaves are good enough at -18 for occasional driving day or night, but I have quit driving with them regularly.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;25 May 2007, 03:36</p><p>Sally </p><p> </p><p>So how thick are your glasses? And how much of a visual field do you have now? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;24 May 2007, 23:42</p><p>Sally, I am new here, but I have also a high minus prescription (- 19 and -20) The visual field is indeed the problem. I have to move my head to read as you. I can't drive in the evening and night. </p><p>What is your email? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sally</b>&nbsp;24 May 2007, 22:55</p><p>Yes, Puffin, its the visual field that's the problem. Moving my head means taking my eyes off what's in front, which can be scarey. I have to move my head to read and things like that, but I'm used to that and there's no danger involved. My acuity is fine. Much better with my new glasses, even at night. The opthomologist also said that lasik was not an option. He was proposing implants. Have other people with high prescriptions had to stop driving, even though they can see well when looking ahead. Thanks for the good wishes AA.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;24 May 2007, 17:19</p><p>Sally, I wonder if the opthamologist was worried about your visual field?  </p><p>(I mean, the total amount you can see by moving your eyes not your head?) </p><p> </p><p>Or if it is just the visual acuity, then perhaps you could try reading a few number plates and measuring the distance. It might tell you how much leeway you have.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AA</b>&nbsp;24 May 2007, 17:13</p><p>Sally I would not over worry about your glasses, yes you may have to turn your head with your rx, but in time you will adjust to this. </p><p> </p><p>Sally over here as long as you can read a number plate 25 yards away with or without glasses you will be able to drive. </p><p> </p><p>I would have thought night driving was a problem for you. we see 25 percent less in the dark, I,m sure you can drive in the dark its just that more difficult for you. </p><p> </p><p>Sally I think you can forget about lasik your RX is far to strong it would be a very chancy operation for you. Its nice to hear you like your glasses after they are part of you just like breathing. Have a lovely weekend.</p><p></p><hr>

At your age and with your Rx you probably really should have an exam twice a year.  I meant to ask you (and perhaps you have posted this before,but I missed it): Do you have bifocals, trifocals, or progressives--and/or prisms?  From what you said about having to bring reading matter so close to your eyes, it sounds as though you  might need multi-lenses. (I have worn trifocals for years--and find them more satisfactory than progressives.) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chris</b>&nbsp;06 May 2007, 12:58</p><p>Hi Eustace &amp; Julian thanks for your posts.  I'm nearly 18 and have worn glasses since age 9.  Yes, 2 yrs is a long time without a change but as I'm used to not seeing very well I just kind of managed somehow. Watching TV was a pain unless I could sit near but reading didn't matter very much as I usually read without glasses anyhow by holding books close to.  What got me in the end was not being able to tie shoes up because I couldn't see them and having to squint a bit before I could recognise friends from across a street.  It all got too much and so I had to admit defeat and get stronger glasses but having done it I'm really pleased with the new look they give me. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;01 May 2007, 22:43</p><p>And, Chris: how much blinder ARE you? In other words, what was your previous Rx? You don't mention your age, but I'm guessing late teens-early twenties, in which case two years is quite a long time to go between tests.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;01 May 2007, 19:47</p><p> </p><p>Chris:  May I ask how old you are, and how old you were when you first began wearing glasses?  Do you have any other vision conditions, other than just being rather myopic?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chris</b>&nbsp;01 May 2007, 12:13</p><p>I got my new glasses yesterday - now up to -8.00 in left and -10.25 right.  It was a shock to see how much blinder I'd become in only 2 years but my optician said that at my age that's expected.  My new glasses are in a black plastic frame and the sides are a bit wider so that the thick edges of the lenses don't show too much but they are quite a lot heavier on my nose than my last pair.  My friends think they look good on me and one of them asked to try them on when we were in the school library by ourselves.  I think he's a bit myopic but not nearly as much as me.  I wait with anticipation to see what he does.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adam</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2007, 13:06</p><p>My cousin has just returned from Taiwan where she teaches English.  In her class of 42 14 yr olds, she said that o her first day all but one were wearing glasses for myopia and when she asked the one boy why he didn't have spex he said he'd broken them playing football and was waiting for them to be fixed!  It seems that they have a very high proportion of myopic teenagers there and she said the fashion these days is for black plastic glasses - rimless looks as if it's out mainly because of the lenses being so thick.  The students complained that my cousin's writing on the board was too small for them to read!  Also, she said that in her school most of the textbooks were now being printed in large type (like we give to partially sighted here) so that they could read without bringing their books so close to their eyes.  Obviously it's serious enough for the authorities to take such costly measures, but they will try anything to arrest the student's myopia - the danger seems that they will have a lot of nearly blind 20 yr olds in just a few years.  </p><p></p><hr>

Sorry </p><p> </p><p>Now the funny thing is they eyes become very funny looking and very big. They were really huge and also, they were difficult to see behind the lenses. It seemed that nobody could keep their eyes opened and still. Their eyes would like wander around, trying to fix at something wildly. One of the player said he was getting sick. But it was frustrating because I couldnt see their eyes right. They were all laughing and saying things like getting stunned and shit when I asked my ordinary glasses back. They all looked at me, mouths and eyes wide open, perhaps wondering how I could see with those things. I remembered somebody told me here that thats how I am supposed to see, and I told them that. That the reading glasses I was using helped me read and see things closer and that one they were holding was my main glasses, for close work and ordinary use. Then they asked me to take my reading glasses off, but since there were lots of WOWs and OHHs and laughing I decided that maybe I was even weirder without them that I refused that. We ate and leaved Mac in silence, everybody discreetly looking at me. Cmon you guys or well be the last one to play and then I ran ahead to soccers fields direction.

The trials and tribulations the original Eustace had to endure would challenge the strongest of men.  </p><p> </p><p>Re your questions, I did post much earlier under the "Guys in Glasses" thread.  I started wearing glasses when I was seven and had a -3, I believe.  Just kept getting worse through my teens (typical!), and although I'm now past 50 I still am experiencing small increases.  I'm at -25.5 and -26.5 with little astigmatism.  I wear blended 20mm myodiscs in a negative carrier and an older pair which are -2 diopters less for reading.  There's no way to get a bifocal segment into such a small area.  I'm quite pleased with them, actually, but have the choice to wear contacts which give me nearly perfect vision. </p><p> </p><p>I know I've seen your posts before but can't remember if you're a high myope.   </p><p> </p><p>Jonny:  Sounds like your eye doctor knows what he's doing, although it seems that you might just need bifocals to deal with that computer.

<p><b>Jonny</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2007, 09:39</p><p>To Sam Eustace &amp; Patrick B - thanks everybody.  I appreciate what you said but my optician is very good and has looked after me very well so far.  He's about 30 and has high myopia too so he knows what its like.  I told him what you all said but he reassured me that my glasses are ok and fit properly as well so it looks as if my eyes are needing some extra help and he is giving me some more tests in a few days time.  I expect he will suggest some new lenses (that's usually what happens) and so it might just be that my present correction is too weak.  I don't post so much because it does make my eyes tired and sore if I stay on the computer too long and my father has something to say about it!  I respect my father and so I will do as he said and only come here infrequently.  But thanks to you who are taking some interest - it has really helped a lot when other people understand.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eustace</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2007, 18:51</p><p> </p><p>Patrick B: </p><p> </p><p>I thought your (and Sam's) advice to Jonny was very good.  Comparatively speaking, his eyesight does not seem to be that bad, and he should be  getting much sharper vision with his glasses, assuming that he has the correct Rx and fit.  You mentioned that your glasses are about twice as stong as Jonny's--so you must be in the minus 21 to 25 range.  I would be interested in knowing just what kind of Rx you currently have and whether you have bifocals, trifocals, progressives, prisms, myodisks, etc.  (You may have posted your Rx in the past, but, if so, I missed it.)  Also, how old were you when you first began wearing glasses?  I was 12 (but probably needed glasses much earlier), and I have worn trifocals for several years now.  </p><p> </p><p>JONNY and 4 EYES (from Sao Paulo); Thanks for your posts in response to my posts to you.

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2007, 11:34</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jonny: </p><p> </p><p>I agree 100% with Sam.  My prescription is double yours, and while I will never have 20/20 with glasses, I certainly don't need to sit in the front of the movie theater to enjoy a film. Years ago when my prescription was similar to yours, my vision was correctible to 20/20 or 20/25.  Today, I estimate that I see 20/30 in the daylight and 20/40 at night. As your prescription gets stronger, you will begin to experience some degree of visual minification which cannot be helped and increasing distortion if you don't look directly through the center of your lenses. </p><p> </p><p>You might want to go to an opthamologist who specializes in high minus prescriptions to make sure that you are being refracted correctly. Then you should go to an optician who specializes in prescriptions over -10.  As Sam said, many "high street" opticians don't really deal with strong/unusual prescriptions on a regular basis and don't really know what they are doing.  Several years ago, my new lenses came back from LensCrafters more than one diopter less than what was prescribed. Unless there is something else wrong with your eyes, you should be able to get your visual acuity pretty close to 20/20</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sam12744</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2007, 00:55</p><p>Jonny, </p><p>Nice sighting! </p><p> </p><p>It sounds to me as if,either your frames need adjusting for position,or,more seriously,the optician hasn't got the"centring" right in the lenses,ie.the PD or pupillary distance(distance between the centre of the pupils)is incorrect.Or,you might even need some prism,perhaps base up or down. </p><p> </p><p>Most likely,the focussing centres of the glasses just aren't in front of your pupils.Tell your optician of the problem and get them to alter whatever needs doing.You certainly shouldn't suffer in silence! You paid them good money to get you seeing properly and there shouldn't be any charge for getting it right! </p><p> </p><p>BTW I have previously found that certain high street chains can be quite inaccurate in their making of one's glasses;a check elsewhere showed up significant differences between the prescription and the actual lenses provided! </p><p> </p><p>Good luck, </p><p>Sam.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jonny</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2007, 11:13</p><p>Thanks Brian &amp; Sam - good of you to write here.  First, I never seem to see very well in the distance.  whe I get new lenses everything looks ok for about a week and the somehow my eyes don't see as well especially with buses - I have to wait until they are near me to read numbers.  Also going to the cinema is a pain because I need to be near the front to see much.  Tilting up my glasses does help a bit, but a friend says it looks odd - but at least I can see better!  Reading has been problematic but I'm about to ask for a separate pair of reading specs which should help.  I too have taken more of an interest in glasses topics and because I wear thick glasses some people make comments about them and at first Iminded but not now.  Recently, coming home from Scotland by train a young army officer about 28 or so sat opposite me.  After an hour or so he started moving his finger in his left eye and to my surprise took out a contact lens from each eye.  He then produced a pair of rimless glasses and put them on and then looked over at me and said "Thank God for that, my eyes were sore!"  I laughed and said that his glasses suited him so he let me try them on.  They were not as strong as mine so he asked to try mine and when he put them on it took him some time to get used to them but said he was impressed and said he'd never seen lenses as powerful.  We chatted a bit more about </p><p>our myopia and both found that it had got worse when we around 13 or 14.  After that we each started reading but I noticed that he held his book closer to his eyes than I did so he may need new lenses soon.  We both went to the buffet car at the same time and resumed our conversation but not about our glasses or anything like that.  Pity! </p><p>Jonny.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2007, 05:39</p><p>Jonny-How well do you see at a distance with your specs? 20/20, 6/6?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sam12744</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2007, 00:50</p><p>Jonny, </p><p>Thanks for the update.I'm glad you are more at ease with your glasses now. </p><p> </p><p>I may not be as myopic as you,but my usual glasses(semi-rimless and 1.67 high index)are 9mm thick at the outer edges.The reason is the number of base-out prisms I need(9 in each lens and could probably do with 11).Games teachers didn't seem to understand that,whilst I wasn't all that shortsighted,I still couldn't see to catch or kick a ball without glasses,because I was seeing double! </p><p>And ,of course,we don't like to admit such weaknesses,at that age! Now,I just love all things glasses and myopia-related. </p><p>Cheers,Sam.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jonny</b>&nbsp;21 Feb 2007, 14:34</p><p>Eustace.  Thanks for your post.  Yes I'm not nearly as self-conscious about my eye issues and it's thanks to my Asian friends as well as Eyescene.  My Rx is L = -12D, R= -10.75.  Pretty blind huh?  My glasses started getting really thick after the age of 12 I think.  I remember going to the opticians about every 6 months and it usually meant a higher Rx.  Luckily my parents could afford it and I got some hi-index lenses each time.  But I managed to break my spex a few times and dad told me to get the cheaper lenses put in so, hey presto next time it was CR-39's and mega thick.  I got plenty of name calling from people I thought were friends but it stopped after a while when some other guys in class started to get problems seeing the board and a few got glasses which made me feel not so on my own.  But, of course I was the only one with the "cock bottles" as they called it.   </p><p>BTW my left les is about 8 or 9 mm at the thickest point - I wonder why you asked that?  I've never measured them before but I think it's accurate.  About three years ago when I was 16 I got some bi-focals to help read small print as my eyes couldn't manage some of the books we had to read at school. </p><p>Sorry to have rambled on.

I already have some difficulties when trying to convince my peers here that I can play normally Those fucking crossed eyes of my, they embarrass me only. I can play normal, at least indoors.  </p><p> </p><p>In fact, my daddy drags me into the Eye doc every two or three months, according to what doctors says. I dont see the reason for such fuzz and I hate that very much. Last year, if I am not wrong I visited doctors in Jan, Mar, Jun, and then July in USA. Later I went to Eye doctor in Sep and Dec. In every visit I had my eyes checked for no less than 3 hours And back in July at UCLA Eye Center University Id returned THREE days for four hours each days as it seemed to me that every eye doctors and students was there to take a little piece of me. But at least I got two brand new pairs of glasses, after Ive my prescriptions be checked twice.  </p><p> </p><p>The fact that I posted three new prescriptions since last June, it is because I got new data every Doc visiting. As I do have my eyes checked every visit in two different doctors office, those data are evaluated one last time before my daddy go get new glasses, because they are very expensive to do AND they take almost a month to get ready.  </p><p> </p><p>I kind of dont care too much about doctors visiting, I really dont like that very much, but it seems that my eyes will be changing for a couple of years yet, and this scares me a lot more than just no being able to drive. </p><p> </p><p>There IS another 4eyes lurking around, but youll know when it is me, my English stinks. </p><p> </p><p>I am still waiting for my new glasses from UCLA guys, but, as I told you, it takes some time to get them delivered, so Ill have to wait.  </p><p> </p><p>PS: To make things worst, I lost my Reading glasses in a Carnival Ball after getting sick. I just dont know where Id put them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Anderson. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

I'm glad that you have bonded with your Chinese classmates. (And, as you must know, there are many people on "Eyescene" who have thicker glasses than yours--and many more people that are attracted to others who wear very thick glasses.  So you have a lot of good company here!)  But, I am curious to know just how thick your glasses are (either in inches or in milimeters).  Also do you wear progressives or bifocals or trifocals or prisms or myodisks?  If so, how old were you when you first began wearing anthing other than a single-lens Rx? </p><p> </p><p>Eustace</p><p></p><hr>

And, if I am following the changes in you prescription, you have had THREE new prescriptions since June: one in June, a second in September, and yet another </p><p>in February?  But, then I believe that you posted somewhere that there is another "4eyes" who posts on "Eyescene"--so maybe I have gotten the two of you confused.

<p><b>jonny</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2007, 16:55</p><p>Hi again.  I'm not allowed to do too much computing as my dad says it's bad for my eyes.  I don't believe it's true but he's in charge!  I'm just nineteen and waiting to get away from home asap.  been wearing glasses since age 9 but my eyes got seriously worse over the last 8 years and now I have to carry a spare pair all the time as I came off my bike a year ago and smashed my spex up and couldn't see anything much.  the police rescued me and took me home.  My two new Chinese mates in school are like me but they just laugh when people mention how thick their glasses are.  that used to embarass me but we just have a laugh now.  Lee is now -15 in his worse eye, Dan is not as myopic as that but he has something called astig which makes his glasses different. I'm ot sure what it is but I tried on his specs and things were very fuzzy but Lee's were ok if I just slipped them down my nose a little.

<p><b>Jonny</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2007, 14:53</p><p>Hi!  I've just started at a new school and was a bit concerned because my sight is poor, around -12D in each eye.  In my last school the teacher let me sit near the board so that I could read stuff ok.  Well, now I'm with a couple of Chinese boys of my own age whose eyes are probably worse than mine and we all sit together on the front row and peer at the board!  It's made me feel better about myself and we have become friends through our common problem.  At last I'm not the only one in class with the thickest glasses!!  BTW I discovered this site through my optician (who is a high  myope like me) but got tired of hearing me moan about having to wear strong lenses.  He told me to get on and see how many others are in the "club" as he called it, and how they cope.  I'm impressed with the way people here are quite casual about their bad eyesight - not how I have thought about it at all for the last 8 years! </p><p>Cheers from Jon</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2006, 18:52</p><p>Hello Ballboy </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Firstly, my glasses are not that massive, but here in Brazil, where the weather is often very hot, I have some straps that hold them up on daily basis. Also, since I really love to swim and play soccer, I have two outdated, (in fact, only one outdate) ordered Google with my prescription. And that was my doctors suggestions after several broken glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Once, I was playing soccer in a indoor field and a guy older that me, maybe sixteen at that time, made a comment about my dad and mom, (as I said before, I am adopted), so I took a wood plank and hit him hard in his back, and simply stood there, just like an asshole, while he was trying to catch his breath back. Well, when he recovered his breath, he spanked me so hard; my glasses flew several meters away. The blood runs out of my nose when he hit me once again. Since I was still holding the plank, I simply hit him again and again. When somebody split us apart and another guy gave me the remnant of my glasses, I simply walked back home, some five square from the place. Id to wait two or three weeks for new glasses. But next weekend I was there again. I only played badly then, so Ive been asked to give my place to another boy. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Now, to you next questions, I am going to try to answer to them. </p><p> </p><p>1. How do you cope with the "tunnel" vision that such powerful lenses cause?  </p><p>I think I see a lot better with them, so this tunnel, I dont understand. I think I learned to use one eye at time. If the ball is in one side, lets say left side, I turn my head to right to use my right eye, or vice versa. If the ball is in front of me, I use either eye, it depends on the situation, but I think I am quite adapted to this thing field of vision, as I do not have binocular, but monocular vision. </p><p> </p><p>2. What do you do when your glasses are broken more than once during one game?  </p><p>Well The last time I got broken glasses it was last year. Id have to use them twisted and mended for nearly a month till I got the new ones, and I almost went crazy with head aching and nauseas and back aching, and my father nearly retuned me to the streets. Just kidding, but he too, almost got mad because of me. So now, I do have glasses straps, two spare update glasses and one update ordered prescription Google. </p><p>3. I keep with them on. I hardly clean my glasses, if not home, when I am showering. Heheh. </p><p>4. Are you afraid to play soccer with glasses? Absolutely no. I only play with my Google. </p><p>5. I have two golden metals, (one being titanium) and two plastic, since its very difficult to find frames to my RX. </p><p>6. I learned long time ago, to have some spare straps in my school backpack, just in case. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>4eyes, from São Paulo, Brasil</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gl</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2006, 14:17</p><p>My girlfriend was quite a sports woman despite her poor vision . She had apair of special well fitted glasses to hold her tick lenses of about -20 but they were very unattractive. She wore them for sports or when not with me. She always wore her regular glasses that looked very attractive other times despite her thick lenses . They would always slide down her nose and many times fall off . I f thedid she had a very dificult time seeing to retrive them. I would often push them up for her or get them for her if they fell off.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ballboy</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2006, 10:21</p><p>4eyes: </p><p> </p><p>How on earth do you manage to keep those massive glasses on your nose while defending at soccer. I just can't imagine playing at the goal (I am a high hyperope). I once tried and the result wa absolute disaster: broken glasses, blood all over the face, people laughing, myself crawling to find the remnants scattered all over the pitch. I did not have spare glasses so you can imagine what I felt like. </p><p>Please tell me: 1. How do you cope with the "tunnel" vision that such powerful lenses cause? Do you see the ball when it is out of the dramatically restricted field of vision? 2. What do you do when your glasses are broken more than once during one game? 3. What do you do when your glasses are fogged up or covered with rain? 4. Are you afraid to play soocer with glasses? 5. What sort of frames do you wear for soccer (metal, plastic). 6. Do you use straps to keep them on your face more securely? I have seen many players lose their glasses in spite of all the precautions. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2006, 17:23</p><p>Hi Cactus Jack and others... </p><p> </p><p>Here is Anderson, from São Paulo. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I dont think expression like "mega rx's" does any good to some of readers here.  </p><p> </p><p>But please, do take me as a crying baby, OK?  </p><p> </p><p>I got a new prescription last June 9th. My new rx grew a little bit to +26,50 and +26,75 UP adding over +32,5 and +32,75 and almost 40º DP prisms Base externa, (out) each lenses, I am not sure,  so I still dont know how my new glasses will looks like. My actual glasses are heavy and they bother me if they arent well fitted. I think that has to do with prisms and the bifocals. Because of these bifocals lenses and my own eyes, Im still learning to use them as I am supposed to do.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Now I still remember I suffered a lot when few months ago, Id broken my glasses playing soccer, I play as goalkeeper, hehe, and had only a very old spare one, with lowered rx and fewer prism. Id had a lot of head aching and kind of disorientation and fallings a lot of falling. And bumping and stepping into things. </p><p> </p><p>So, to preventing this to happen again, I asked my dad if he could get two new glasses at once, as they are very difficult to be made. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Hi Cactus Jack, what my doctors told me is that I do have the internal lenses but they are malformed? like theyre unequaled  like they are not there. (I really dont know how to spell that). </p><p>I know I am a switcher, my eyes moves differently from each other that even my peers can tell which eye Im using cause I move my head to opposite side. I know Ive been said I have bilateral Duane syndrome and some others eyes issues, but after a aboard trip last year, doctors suspect I do have some kind of Congenital Extraocular Fibrosis, whatever that means. </p><p>Anyway, I dont want to be not prepared, so I want have a spare glasses for any emergency. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for listening. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plusheavy</b>&nbsp;26 Apr 2006, 01:59</p><p>4eyes: there is no need to feel offened or to laugh at what I wrote. I apologise if it hurt you, though,of course, I did not  want to offend you. Unfortunately, the world is full of jerks of all sorts who may  get excited over practically everything, including various physical impairments. I only wanted to show the absurdity to which all this may lead. I am certainly not one of those jerks, and I am fully sympathetic with your difficulties, which are quite similar to my own visual problems. My nickname ('plusheavy') is a direct allusion to the kind of glasses which I have to suffer since early childhood. Though now not quite so heavy as they used to be (plastic and all that), they are still uncomfortable and the last thing I can say is that they contribute to my good self-image. </p><p>   I wish you all very good luck. Please stay on the forum.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Danny</b>&nbsp;24 Apr 2006, 13:41</p><p>Well, I never know if people are true or if they are faking, but like most people here (I guess) I generally trust people. In the case of 4eyes, his story always rings true, he is never confused or mistaken in his comments (unlike people who claim one day to be 1 rx and a totally diffrent rx the next) AND 4eyes has posted some photos onto the web.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2006, 09:29</p><p>4eyes, </p><p>As I have said before, I admire your spirit.  I have thought and continue to think you are real.  You were dealt a rotten hand, but you are playing it well. </p><p>You remind me of an acquaintance from long ago.  His motto was "Find a way or make one".  I have remembered it and tried to apply it frequently. </p><p>I would offer this very corrupted latin: </p><p>"Non Illigitimus Carborundum" rougly translated "Don't let the b*****ds grind you dowm".  You obviously haven't and don't. </p><p>You asked about Low Vision, I believe the term Low Vision is mostly related to problems in the retina, optic nerve, and visual cortex of the brain rather than optical or positional problems. </p><p>I have often wondered, with all the medical advances, if some implanted lenses or internal contact lenses might significantly reduce your need for external plus in your glasses and give you a wider field of view and greater depth of focus.  I don't know how familiar you are with telescopes or cameras, but because of the vertex distance, strong plus glasses act very much like tlelscopes or telephoto lenses on cameras.  They have narrow fields of view and very short depth of field. </p><p>Also, I have wondered if it might be possible to transplant some small muscles to reduce your esotropia and perhaps reduce your need for prism. </p><p>How are your retinas, optic nerves, and vision cortex?  With your early uncorrected vision problems, it is possible that they did not develop well. If you could fix the optical and positional problems and deliver good sharp images to your retinas, would the rest of your vision system provide the results you need?   </p><p>BTW, your written English is very good and vastly better than my Portuguese. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2006, 16:16</p><p>Lentifan, </p><p> </p><p>Indeed there are some odd choices of frame that seem chosen for fashion rather than suitability. I wish people would wear what suits them more than they do at present! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2006, 14:17</p><p>Plusheavy </p><p>I can't say I find the thought of someone being teased or ridiculed for their thick glasses a turn-on.  Like, I think, most OOs, I find the thick glasses attractive in themselves, so the wearer becomes more attractive.  I think I would always be sympathetic, and (in the case of ladies) more attracted to someone wearing thick glasses. </p><p>I sometimes find myself criticising some folks' choice of frames as being unflattering.  I think people (as with other branches of the fashion industry) are sometimes swayed towards styles that are currently in vogue, whether it suits them or not.  So, at the risk of irking ehpc and others, in general I think blonde girls should avoid bold black plastic frames.  But that's only mental comment; I'd not dream of criticising openly.  Beauty in the eye of the beholder, etc </p><p>So, as an incorrigible OO, I am attracted to, and often envious of, wearers of thick lensed-glasses.  Even if I was 'normal', I think I'd feel it no more appopriate to tease/ridicule someone with thick glasses than for any other physical feature, such as skin colour.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plusheavy</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2006, 07:59</p><p>Puffin, </p><p>indeed, it takes all sorts to make the world. Yet, watching someone being ridiculed and teased about his/her thick glasses, or worse (?) teasing that person, </p><p>may also turn out to be part of the excitement. The question is how far can you go? Is a person like 4eyes (if he really exists)a victim or an object of adoration? Or is all this some kind of fetishist sadism?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2006, 07:05</p><p>I would like to feel that in being an OO I am feeling sympathetic towards those needing glasses to see, rather than being repulsed by them, or making fun of them. Yes I can see how glasses with suncream on might be sexually appealing. Sorry it sounds sick - but that's my taste and not someone else's. Oftentimes I see other fetishes and interests and find them interesting, odd, plain weird or whatever. I think that's the nature of things - nobody likes everything.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pebbles</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2006, 23:36</p><p> </p><p>Plus heavy: You have summed it up. I wear progressives, so the change in magnification is not as bad as it would be for 4eyes with his bifocals. I have to jerk my head around if I change my field of vision and a person (or car!) close to me but just outside my field of vision could be invisible to me. To see stairs or curbs I have to judge from a distance where it will be when I get to it or bend my head down and try to look through the top part of my spex, otherwise the distorion makes it impossble to judge.Even though my RX is quite low compared to 4eyes and others, I sometimes use a cane at night and a staff whn hiking to feel my way and steady me in case I fall. I'm used to it and have learnt how to get by OK.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plusheavy</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2006, 07:22</p><p>Of course, cut-in does not apply in  evaluating the power of plus glasses. To estimate the power of strong plus lenses the angle at which the wearer's eyes are seen is relevant. The field of vision shrinks with the power of lenses. What it means in practice is that when you stand inside the wearer's field of vision, you can see his eyes (however magnified by the lenses); if   </p><p>you stand outside his field of vision, you can't see his eyes, but he can't see you either. This is why wearers of powerful plus glasses have to jerk their heads in all directions to "catch" what they want to see and bring it within their highly restricted field of vision. In many cases one step to the right or to the left of the wearer places you outside his field of vision. Walking up and down stairs, I take it, creates another major problem. In thick plus lenses you can hardly see your feet without practically bending down.  Pebbles and Foureye, can you comment on the above?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pebbles</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2006, 16:30</p><p> </p><p>4eyes:  </p><p>Keep trying to get used to your bifocals. Don't worry about how you look in your glasses and try to forget about the mean people who laugh at you. You know who your true friends are. When I was your age I was bullied a lot and it just made me tougher. It will get better for you as you get a bit older.  Some people do not understand how difficult it can be for people with very bad eyesight. Try to explain it to the ones who will listen and they might tell the bullies to back off. </p><p> </p><p>Learn to love your glasses, because they let you do so many things.  If you are like me you probably work very hard at everything you do to show you are as good as or better than anyone else, especially the ones who laugh at you.  </p><p> </p><p>As for your thick, heavy glasss slipping down your nose, I wear a sports strap when I am running or doing exercise, maybe you could wear one of these all the time.

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2006, 14:20</p><p>Hi pebbles... </p><p> </p><p>I am an almost 17 years old Brazilian boy and my actual rx is +25,00 and +25,75 UP adding +30,75 and +31,50 bottom, but the 15º DP prisms with another over 20º DP stick fresnell prisms for each lenses are my worst problem,  so my glasses is heavy and funny looking and they are always slipping down my nose bridge and, they were hurting me very much I got it fixed, so they dont hurt me so much now. </p><p>Since my glasses is a bit heavy and slip down often, Im always pushing them up, for they bothers me if they arent well positioned. I think that has to do with prisms and the bifocals. Because of these bifocals lenses and my own eyes peculiarities, Im still learning to walk with easy and to use each part of my glasses as I am supposed to. I have to be very careful with them, since they take too long to get ready, almost three weeks, as I learned last February. </p><p>Apart from people making unkind comments about my hugely magnified eyes, the worst part is my lack of peripheral, I have the same problem here Also I am cross-eyed and recently my doctor says that the difficult I have at night is due to poor night vision. I would like very much to hear from you. </p><p> </p><p>Please, forgive my poor English. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

I have tried their glasses and id probably say 75% of the people whos glasses ive tried were weaker than my -4 pescription.

My brother is a -1.25 and doesnt need glasses except for driving.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Most high myopes choose contacts over glasses, further reducing the number of high myopes I see walking around in glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>plusheavy</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2006, 02:34</p><p>Pebbles, thanx for your post. Have you ever tried contacts? What is your distant vision w/o glasses? What kind of lenses do you use to get a better peripheral vision? Surely, lenticulars are bound to reduce your field of vision to make it more like "tunnel" vision. Is driving at all possible in such glasses? Also isn't microphtalmia a medical term of "dwarf eyes"? Please answer if you feel like it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Girl Guest</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2006, 16:19</p><p>at -11 I tend to wear glasses just because they are more comfortable than CLs (and I like the ability to remove them and be myopic when I want). My eye doc has told me he has very few patients "close to my prescription". In glasses most of the time, no guy has struck up a conversation and weaved in glasses. Actually most guys just stare and say nothing. Going to get hate mail but most guys, glasses fetish aside, look at woman from the neck down. I know-I have two older brothers. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VTL</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2006, 08:27</p><p>GOCer </p><p>From my own experience, I can assure that highly myopic people are not treated any differently from anyone else. My glasses have been well in the -20's for many years and, as far as jobs, a good social life and many friends of both sexes, they have not made a scrap of difference to my life except in one way. Glasses have enabled me to lead a totally normal life which, otherwise, would have been totally impossible. However, it is true to say that, sadly, I seldom come across highly myopic girls! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GOCer</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2006, 03:30</p><p>Specs4ever, I still find the fact that you've met all these high myopes facinating.  I have been doing GOC and wearing these coke-bottled -18s around for 3 years now hoping it would catch the attention of some hidden high myope since I've never met anyone higher than -11.  I've only stumbled across a full-time contacts wearer who has -13 glasses, and that was because someone else told me she was -13, and I have known of her even before I did GOC.   </p><p> </p><p>Maybe it's just the social circles I run across - but GOC as a means to meet high myopes has not been working so well for me.  It's turned into a different social experiment for me - one of seeing if a person with very thick glasses gets treated any different because of their glasses.  And it's also a way to see if it's possible to lead a normal lifestyle as an extremely high myope.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>hooked</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2006, 23:40</p><p>My wife is hyperope with ca. +5. I have seen a lot of glasses wearers which are stronger than hers. So I wouldn't say rarely is correct.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guido</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2006, 17:22</p><p>Filthy,  the beauty is that you can manipulate the situation so that they never see the "stiffie".</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2006, 12:55</p><p>There may be a lot of them, but as a proportion of the population, they are exceedingly rare.  I know that if I were an optometrist I would bill myself as a specialist in high prescriptions to skew the curve towards my preferred type of customer.  Then I would, of course, be booted out of the profession for getting a stiffie while examining a patient.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2006, 11:34</p><p>Ok, in the last 30 years I have met personally - not this internet stuff, 5 ladies who I consider super high myopes.  The highest of the 3 wears -27D contact lenses, and this translates to around -43D for glasses.  The next one is -30DR and -29DL, and wears superlenti glasses. The third has a medium prescription, with -25.50D R and around -22D L with some astigmatism. Then there was a lady in her early 60's who was around -22D. This lady had to quit her job as a bookeeper, because her eyes kept deteriorating. The last one was a young nurse of about 21 when I met her in a hospital in 1989, and I don't know if her prescription has stabilized around the -20D she was then, or if it has climbed higher since then. </p><p> </p><p>I can't begin to count on both hands the number of people I have met personally with prescriptions in excess of -16D.  Some I remember more than others, in  particular, the 6 year old boy who had a prescription of over -18D in both eyes.  As far as people I have met with prescriptions between -10 and -18, I have met so many that I wouldn't even begin to attemt to tell you about them. </p><p> </p><p>Of course, I meet a lot of these people walking around malls and/or shopping centers when I am out doing GOC.  I use my own strong glasses as a starting point to begin a conversation, and sometimes the only way I can determine their prescription is to switch glasses with them and do a blur interpretation as best as I can.  Usually my glasses are stronger, but once or twice I have been beaten out by their glasses being stronger. </p><p> </p><p>And, I am on the lookout for these people.  Normal opthalmologists or optometreists do not see a really high myope in their every day work.  But if you hang around a hospital with an optical clinic, you will see more. </p><p> </p><p>And, there are more very high myopes having lens implants every day, as they have overworn their contact lenses so much that they can no longer wear contacts. </p><p> </p><p>I don't mean to belittle anyone, but there are lots of high myopes out there.</p><p></p><hr>

Giancarlo Esposito played the character "Buggin Out" who wore super stong plus glasses. I read in the book about the movie that he used contacts to counter-act the "+5" glasses. and didn't tell anyone on the set that he was using GOC, so his castmates were taken aback when he suddenly showed up wearing the strong glasses all day.

<p><b>Plusheavy</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2006, 06:23</p><p>Very thick plus lenses (+10 up)are usually associated with post-cataract aphakia (removed lens in the eye) rather than with hyperopia (farsightedness), which rarely exceeds +5. Yet, I have known a number of hyperopes with corrections as terrifying as +15. Their distant vision without glasses is not much better than that of myopes. Also  accomodation was only mildly helpful when they were teenagers, so they had to use glasses at a very early age for both near and distant vision. As far as I know the world record for natural hyperopia is in the range of  +25. These unfortuntes certainly do not have to resort to GOC to know what it means to  wear powerful hideous thick glasses.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

He sees very few people in the -12 to -15 range. Most people he sees are actually in the -2 to -5 range. Many people around -1 see pretty well and dont even realize they are very mildly myopic.

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2006, 13:28</p><p>Filthy: Be careful what you wish for! I'm -4 and I find it uncomfortable to read without glasses for any considerable length of time and I can't see to use the computer at all without them.

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2006, 05:37</p><p>Julian:  Regarding the relative prevalence of myopia and hyperopia, I share your understanding that hyperopes are far more common, but are usually uncorrected to a certain age because latency - you can accommodate for it until prebyopia hits.  Many older people not only wear a plus correction for reading, but for distance as well, meaning that they are/were hyperopic and can't overcome it anymore.</p><p></p><hr>

Correction of myopia certainly is more common until we reach the age when presbyopia sets in and/or the hyperopia ceases to be latent - then I think we hyperopes catch up fast! </p><p>I'm fascinated that you and your hyperopic father agree that you'd rather be myopic, up to a point, than hyperopic. I've been pondering what you say, and I know what you mean, and I'd probably agree with you if I didn't actually like wearing glasses.  </p><p>As it is, when I get up in the morning I usually put on a pair of readers and wear them around the house for the first half-hour at least. I need good near vision for shaving and for early morning activities like changing calendars, feeding the cat, putting on the kettle; but for distance vision indoors I'm quite happy looking either over or through them. It's a different matter when I go out of doors or switch on the television. So I guess if I were a low myope I'd be bareyed indoors until I needed to see anything in the distance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>presbyopia_23</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2006, 23:33</p><p>myopia is much more common than hyperopia despite what one optometrist thinks. I know far more myopes. Hyperopia is actually preferred over myopia for young people as long as the hyperopia is mild because they can accomodate around it. High hyperopia or hyperopia in older people is a bad thing. Your vision will be blurry at all distances, much more so from near. At least with myopia your in focus from near. My whole family is myopic except my dad whos like a +6 but his progressive glasses do a fine job. He wishes he was myopic instead then he could see up close without glasses. I wish I were less myopic but im thankful im myopic instead of hyperopic(and with my presbyopia, ill feel the full effects of hyperopia!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Frances</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2006, 08:47</p><p>Evelyn, agree with AA, dont worry about your glasses, just wear them. </p><p>I wear plus glasses as well, so know your problems. I always thought my eyes looked big in mine, but other people told me they looked nice. Both my daughters also wear plus glasses, the olderst has a quite strong rx in hers, and whilst they do make her eyes look quite big, it also looks very attractive, she is 16, but looks great in them. I began wearing mine at 18, and would not be without them now. My eldest daughter has had them for about a year and the youngest just 2 months. </p><p>Just go for it  Evelyn, sure they look great on you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AA</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2006, 06:32</p><p>Evelyn, don,t worry about your glasses and the strength of your lenses, guys like me love to see ladies wearing plus glasses, I think your RX is really nice, and I think you may imagine your glasses are making your eyes bigger than they really are, anyway Evelyn you have your admirers who would love to see you in your glasses, and you would be amased how attractive plus glasses look. I,m sure your attractive and gorgeous Evelyn be bold and love you glasses. AA</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ajr</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2005, 09:39</p><p>Evelyn:  In answer to your enquiry, there is a way to reduce this magnification of your eyes, the use of aspheric lenses minimises this magnification effect together with minimising oblique astigmatism for plus powers, not to mention aspheric lenses are on average 15% thinner and lighter and 25% flatter than standard CR39 lenses.  </p><p> </p><p>Today, everything around us is becoming thinner, smaller and more stylish. Lenses are no exception.  Over 60% of consumers want lenses that are thinner and flatter for improved aesthetic appeal.  </p><p> </p><p>The average cost of a pair of glasses in 2004 was $260 (£149) (source: FODO/Mintel).

<p><b>Brille</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2005, 03:23</p><p>Sgboy: How did you find the courage to go for a test needing -38?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sgboy</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2005, 23:28</p><p>i'm using GOC. I have a natural myopia of about -2.5R and -3 left. For +6.5 contacts, i use -11.50L and -13.50 R. For +8 contact, I wear -14L and -15R. For +10, I go up to -17.5R and -18.5L. However, i can accomodate up to -19.5 and -20, though it's a starin after a while. </p><p> </p><p>I took a risk and went for a refraction with my +20 (hard lenses) contacts. It was a risk as i vehemently denied their request to go on the autorefractor, and insisted on a manual refraction. With those contacts, i could see up to -38 for both eyes, but unfortunately, they couldn't get the lenses in that prescription. I was wearing -30 then, and could see ok with the glasses, though not very well. Gotta push them real close before the vision is somewhat acceptable. </p><p> </p><p>Somehow, the opticians in my country are not very on their toes, so it's pretty easy to cheat, as long as you dun go under the auto refractor. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

I'm using a different formula and I don't trust it very much either. </p><p>I'm trying to gather as much data as I can to try to improve the accuracy of the GOC calculations.  Unfortunately, I'm not getting much feedback on experiences with GOC and the various formulas.  The biggest problem seems to be estimating Vertex Distance which is the controlling factor at high Rxes .   </p><p>I'm working on a simple tool, that can be made and used without assistance, to measure vertex distance. </p><p>BTW we probably ought to be doing this on the GOC thread. </p><p>CJ. </p><p>   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sam12744</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2005, 08:14</p><p>Cactus jack, </p><p>I always bow to your greater knowledge! I was using the goc.exe file on the yahoo goc group.In my experience with it,there is a tendancy to overestimate the + dioptres required in the contact lenses (which I had forgotten when doleing out advice!).For my GOC,I use +8.5 contacts ,when it suggests +9.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2005, 16:31</p><p>Julian &amp; Sam12744 - Thanks for your confidence, I hope it is not misplaced. </p><p>For the record, a CL Rx for a MINUS lens will be LESS than the refracted Rx for glasses and a CL Rx for a PLUS lens will be MORE than the refracted Rx for glasses.  </p><p>Alex - Unfortunately it is not that simple.  The problem is that you have to consider the effects of vertex distance (VD) on glasses and contact lens power and at -13D each mm of vertex distance will affect the effective Rx by 0.17D or nearly 0.25D. </p><p>Using the generally accepted formula for CL calculation, -13.00 glasses will require an eye power of approximately +10.75D assuming a vertex distance of 13mm. </p><p>If your refracted Rx is -5.00 at a VD or 13mm your CL Rx at 0mm VD would be -4.675 which would mean that your eye power is +4.675.  If you used a +6.00 lens, that should give you +10.75 which should be about right for -13.00 glasses. </p><p>Unfortunately, GOC is not an exact science (yet) and frankly, I have some problems with the formulas so I think that you may have to go to higher + CLs to match the -13.00 glasses (unless you have some accommodation left).  Fortunately, with your -5.00 Rx you are in the range of inexpensive disposable CLs. </p><p>Also, if -5.00 is not your exact glasses Rx for both eyes including cylinder, my recomendations have no meaning. </p><p>To help me refine my GOC calculations to everyone's benefit, please give me feedback on your actual Rx and results. </p><p>CJ.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Remember the vertex distance thing works the opposite way with plus lensesthat is, the contact lens strength needed is MORE than that for specs.

<p><b>sam12744</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2005, 09:34</p><p>Alex, </p><p>No doubt Cactus Jack will explain,but ,depending on the distance from your contact lenses to the lenses of the -13 glasses,I reckon you would need +6.75 or +7 cls for that GOC combination (assuming you don't wear your glasses well down your nose!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alex</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2005, 08:40</p><p>Returning to the issue of the difference between contact lens and glasses prescriptions, if my glasses Rx is -5 and I want to do GOC at -13, can I just get +8 contacts, or is it more complicated? In other words, are plus prescriptions similar to minus ones in terms of there being a difference between contacts and glasses?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2005, 16:41</p><p>4eyes - You don't need to appologize for your English, it is very much better than my Portuguese - which is nearly non-existent even though I spent about 10 days in Brasil (San Jose dos Campos and Rio) about 30 years ago. </p><p>Here are some definitions that might be helpful in understanding your vision. </p><p>1. Prism Diopter - that amout of prism that will deflect a ray of light 1 cm at a distance of 1 meter.  A prism diopter can be converted, using trigonometry, to about 0.6 degrees per diopter.  40 D of prism would cause or compensate for about 24 degrees of deflection. </p><p>2. Monocular vision - Seeing with one eye at a time.  If you have vision in both eyes, it likely that with your eyes being crossed, you learned to see using one eye at a time because there was no way for you to fuse the images from both eyes into a single image without having significant prism to help. </p><p>One of the problems with prism is that prisms are used to break white light into its compoment colors of the spectrum and color fringing is common in high prism glasses and also in high powered lenses. </p><p>Is it going to be hard for you to get a drivers license, YES.  Can you do it?  I don't know, but with your incredible sprit, determination, and drive, my money is on your figuring out to do it SAFELY - not only for you but for others.   </p><p>It is a delight to hear of your accomplishments.  The important thing is to TRY and to not give up.  All problems are impossible to solve - until someone figures out how to do it. </p><p>At an early stage in his research Thomas Edison was asked by a reporter if he would ever find a way to make an electric light blub.  He said he was not sure, but he had found a thousand ways to NOT make one, but he was not giving up.  Obviously he succeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams.  </p><p>Best regards, </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

You are dealing with bureaucrats who probably must follow the regulations or loose their job, which is the worst possible thing that can happen to a bureaucrat. </p><p>2.  Find the regulations that cover visual accuity for getting a driving license in Brasil and learn them forward and backward.  I suspect that the rules for vision are based on numerical values and make no mention of the words "severe", "high", "huge" or "limited" which are very subjective. </p><p>3.  Find out what kinds of tests that you will be given to prove that you can see well enough to drive. </p><p>4.  If you can meet the minimum requirements for a driving license, they probably cna't refuse to issue you one. </p><p>5. If you can't meet the minimum requirements, they can't issue you a license without risking their job. </p><p>In the vision department, have you investigated or considered things that can improve you peripheral vision such as: </p><p>1. Internal plus lenses between the iris and cornea to minimize your glasses Rx (I recall that you have had cataract surgery where the lens and capsule were removed) </p><p>2.

<p><b>presbyopia_23</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2005, 17:59</p><p>myodiscs can technically be made as low as you want them but its pointless because youd see better with conventional glasses or high index.

I did not know this either but now I do and ive worn contacts too so I have personal experience. your -4 contacts are equivalent to -5 glasses. Just mulitply contacts by 1.25 to arrive at glasses. -3 contacts is -3.75 glasses.  </p><p>Your contacts do take care of all the cylindar but make you a hyperope which your accomodating. If we add your myopia and cylindar, we get -5 which your -4 contacts fully correct. However it overcorrects the sphere part making you a +1 hyperope without astigmastim.  </p><p>-3 contacts would make you plano but youd still have all your astigmastim.  </p><p>so basically you can choose to be +1 which your accomodating or plano with your astigmastim.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I however am worried about you inducing more myopia by bumping your pescription. My sister was a -2.5 with -.75 astigmastim but got -2.75 contacts making her a +1 hyperope but taking care of all her astigmastim and giving her sharp 20/20 vision.

I wonder why your sister's is less - I'd read somewhere that below about -4 it wasn't necessary to reduce the contacts prescription until the person got older - approaching middle age and loosing the ability to focus I guess.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2005, 11:10</p><p>Regarding myodisc prescriptions, at what stage in a prescription do you have to get myodisc lens?  That is, you have no choice but to opt for these lens.  Can you get myodisc lenses if you ask for them in a lower prescription?  If so, what is the lowest prescription they would fashion them?  Not knowing that much about the crafting of the lenses, do you have to get myodisc lenses because they cannot craft a regular lens in that power?  Anyone know the answers to these questions?

Theres a thread where people actually induce more myopia. I read it and just do the opposite of that. Bump my pescription down from -5 to -4.25 for 24/7 wear. around the house I bump it down even further to -3.25. For eating and reading I go bare eye. For reading, you will want an undercorrection of -2.5 to -4 diopters. For computer work youll want -1 to -1.75 undercorrection. Ditto for going around the house. for 24/7 usage, you can take -.5 to -1 undercorrection. Sash your full power glasses in your car to use just for driving. Do you ever squint? I hear its a bad habit that places strain on your eyes. I just move closer or tilt my glasses. So far I have achieved anywhere from -.5 to -1 diopter improvement in my vision. I remember I used to be -5.75 in the left eye 2 years ago. Now I can see nearly as well with -4.75(same glasses, but right lense)id say about half a line worse so -5 makes sense for me.

Im about a -5 and with -1 contacts(equal to -1.25 glasses due to vertex distance) I can see a blurry 20/300. I see 20/40 with -1 contacts and my -3.25 glasses over them while I see 20/50 with -4.25 glasses. My -3.25 contacts give me a blurry 20/50, they correct me nearly as much as my -4.25 glasses.

Theres quite a difference between 20/300 and 20/500. If im outside in broad daylight and just walking then yes I can see well enough to walk around the block without glasses.

My brother rarely wears glasses because at 20/60 this isnt much of a blur to bother with the hassles of glasses.

<p><b>presbyopia_23</b>&nbsp;07 Nov 2005, 21:49</p><p>ah that explains it! You may want to use your older and weaker glasses for reading and the computer to avoid inducing more myopia. I am about a -5 but ive been using my -3.25s for the computer and reading without glasses. I also have stopped wearing full power glasses and stopped getting new pescriptions. Ive noticed my vision has actually improved a bit. My moms a -7 to -8 in her eyes and my sisters in the mid -3s I think. My bro never got much past -1 and he almost never wears glasses. Dads a high hyperope with +6. We all have a bit of astigmastim. I always had less than -1 diopters of that so it hasnt interfered with my near vision. Wow I hope your eyes stop getting worse and never get close to -20 thats just insane :(</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Emily</b>&nbsp;07 Nov 2005, 19:09</p><p>"May I ask how old you are."  Yes, you may.  I am 19.  I have worn glasses for 8 1/2 years.  I had small annual increases until I was 15 and then my progesssion became much more rapid.  In the last 4 years, my prescription has changed 7 times.  In part this is hereditary, since virtually my entire extended famliy is highly myopic.  My grandmother was around -20.  In part it is how I use my eyes -- I am a bigtime bookworm and a college student.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>presbyopia_23</b>&nbsp;07 Nov 2005, 18:35</p><p>"Take the sphere part of your prescription and multiply by 100 and that's your demoninator.

I tested this myself with the huge 20/1600 E I made(yes its about 27" big!) and I put on two pairs of reading glasses.

Therefore -2 diopters of astigmastim blurs as much as -1 diopters of myopia. However this is at 20 feet and out. Astigmastim is insidious because it blurs from all distances whereas with myopia your vision from near is obviously much improved. Ive seen people with -1 to -2 diopters of astigmastim have to wear glasses full time and they had a hard time reading anything without glasses. While those with -1 to -2 diopters of myopia can go fine without glasses for near activities such as reading or using the computer.

<p><b>presbyopia_23</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2005, 03:25</p><p>I guess we should use the term functionally blind then or hypothethical legally blind to describe those higher myopes without their glasses. It also depends on the person. I know some with -2 or even -1 diopters who feel "blind" without glasses and complain how blurry everything is. I just laughed at my -2 friend and said if you think your 20/100 is blurry, try being a -5 and 20/500 like me! In fact I often wear -3.25 glasses which give me 20/100 vision. Being a mild presbyope, this undercorrection makes things from near and intermediate clear such as when I am typing this with -3.25s. I wear -4.25s now when I go out. They very slightly undercorrect me that it doesnt really bother me and I am happy knowing this should stop or even reverse the progression of myopia. Many of you may have outdated pescriptions of -.5 to -1.5 diopters yet you see fine and havent bothered updating it.  </p><p>20/40 guys absolutely dont need glasses, I even wonder why they bother unless they actually like wearing them ;) 20/100 guys can function without glasses but they are a convinence when going out places. 20/200 guys are quite dependant on glasses but dont need them for close work and possibily intermediate. Worse than that and your a full time wearer</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;24 Sep 2005, 10:53</p><p>Jersey Boy </p><p>I worked in NYC (Times Square area) and lived in Jersey City in the 80's and used NJ Transit from the Port Authority Bus terminal.  My rx then was around -6.  I suppose I could have managed to get home w/o correction -- at least if I was taking my usual bus from the usual platform.  Trying to read signs to figure out where I was supposed to go would have been difficult.  I imagine at -4 it would be easier, but require a lot of squinting. </p><p> </p><p>As I said previously, there is a large subjective factor.  Some low to moderate myopes can become so disoriented by the blur that they think the can't see anything.  In reality, until a certain stage of myopia, it can be possible to learn to recognize blurry objects and manage better than you think you could.  I know a -8 guy who used to think he was "blind" and then realized that, at least in familiar surroundings, he could do more than he had realized. </p><p> </p><p>Of course, when one reaches the stage where everything beyond a foot or two away is just a blob, what you can do without correction becomes very limited.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2005, 12:27</p><p>I think I'm the one who stands corrected.  I did a google search and found that legally blind is definded as 20/200 or worse with correction.  20/200 would be roughly equivalent to the vision of a -3 myope without correction.  This definition seems to mainly apply to eligibility for Social Security disability benefits.  It's a curious definition, based presumably on the fact that such uncorrectable eyesight would disqualify one for many (certainly not all) types of work. </p><p> </p><p>The term "legally blind" gets tossed around as meaning something like "functionally" blind.  When we say someone would be "legally blind" without their glasses/contacts, we usually mean the person would be pretty helpless -- hence someone with, or close to, double-digit myopia. </p><p> </p><p>I'd certainly not consider an uncorrected -3 myope to be "blind".  Even with my -4/-5 eyes I could manage to function in a lot of situations -- although I'd find it very uncomfortable.  I'd tend to define "blind" without glasses/contacts as the point where you might trip over or run into things navigating a room -- probably around -10.  Of course, this is a very subjective thing.  Persons who are literaly blind can learn to function quite well in many situations and persons' with -1 myopia can feel very disoriented and "blind" without correction.  There are many stories on eyescene of even -5 or higher myopes not realizing they had a probem until they first got glasses -- and then, after wearing glasses for a while, feeling helpless without them.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2005, 09:00</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wayne, </p><p> </p><p>I stand corrected.  Yes, I always watch with some amusement the obviously highly nearsighted guy who pretends that he can see without glasses.  Someone I know who is a -8 always pulls that stunt in a restaurant.  When he sits down at the table he always takes his glasses off and carries on as if he doesn't need them.  I know that he can't see anything of significane.  When the menus are handed out, he very casually puts his glasses back on.  Heaven forbid if he actually had to read the menu uncorrected.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>You</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2005, 08:51</p><p>Leagelly blind in the US is 20/400 BCVA.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2005, 08:30</p><p>"Legally blind" is determined with respect to BCVA (Best Corrected Visual Acuity).

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2005, 20:33</p><p>Patrick B </p><p>I wouldn't describe -5 as legally blind.  At least in the US that would start at something like -10.  I agree, however, that functioning w/o correction with that level of myopia would be difficult.  </p><p> </p><p> My rx is currently R -4 L -5.  (it was up to -6.50 until presbyopia set in.) I'm certainly not "blind" compared to you double-digit people but I would be very uncomfortable trying to function w/o my glasses.  I can recognize people several feet away, but can't see their facial expressions clearly.  I can walk around the house and recognize somewhat blurry things across the room if they're not too small.   I can read about a foot away but need to get uncomfortably close to read with just my -5 eye, etc. </p><p> </p><p>I consider the range from -4 to -6 as one where you really need correction full time but can sort of fake it.  By -6 it gets pretty difficult.  I love watching guys attempting to manage without their glasses in this range and trying to not let on that they can't really see.  I remember one guy in high school with something like -6 who would never put on his glasses until he had sat down at his desk and opened the book.  At that point the glasses were apparently less embarrassing than needing to lean close to read.  I think he was trying to pretend they were just reading glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;03 Sep 2005, 09:06</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jaymac, </p><p> </p><p>Wow!  You've really got a strong prescription, and it sounds as if you're still getting more myopic as you get older.  My prescription has increased recently, and I suspect I will have another increase when I go in for a check-up in a few months.  What sort of visual acuity do you have with your lenses?  Stuart and I are about 20/30 to 20/40, and I hope that I can maintain that level of acuity if my prescription continues to climb.  How big are your bowls and are your lenses biconcave, plano-fronted or do you have double myodiscs?  I remember from the pictures you posted at one point that your bowls looked like they were only about 10/15 mm across.  I'm actually quite happy with the cosmetics of my blended, biconcave myos in 1.8 high index lenses with a minus carrier.  My lenses are only 46 mm across, and I might get a smaller frame next time if my prescription increases to keep the edge thickness down. </p><p> </p><p>Didn't you also say that your wife was  a high myope?    </p><p> </p><p>Wei, </p><p> </p><p>Your friend with the -5 prescription must be amazed with what he is now seeing.  Mark my words, he will be a fulltime wearer in short order.  My God, he was walking around legally blind.  Oh, and keep up the work with the myodiscs.  You will get used to them which is a good idea if your prescription continues to increase.  Best to get used to them now when you still have the option of wearing conventional lenses.  If your eyesight continues to worsen, there could come a time when you no longer have a choice but to wear myodiscs. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;02 Sep 2005, 13:18</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Wei, </p><p> </p><p>Glad that you're trying to get used to your new myodiscs.  Nothing is ever perfect, but you will gradually get used to the bowl, especially if it is close to your eyes.  Re your questions about 1.9 lenses, you might want to check out Optical4Less's website.  They carry this material and might be able to answer any questions you might have re lens thickness.  Your prescription is very strong, but a lot less than mine, so you might be able to use this material for your next pair of glasses.  I believe it is produced up to -25. </p><p> </p><p>Incidentally, I think Stuart and I are more or less tied for highest prescriptions.  He has a lot of astigmatism added to a slightly lower spherical prescription than mine.  My astigmatism is too minimal to deal with.  There was a guy who posted on this site a long while ago who had a prescription nearing -40.  He posted pictures of his glasses which had amazingly small bowls.  Now that would present a real challenge to get used to.  </p><p></p><hr>

Next to us was a table with a big group of six couples.  All the men were high myopes with very thick glasses.  Two were rimless, one had a black, oblong wire frame and two were semi-rimless.  None of the girls wore spex at all.  We sat outside and as it began to get dark it was fun to watch the boy's glasses glinting in the lights in the trees above. We were about to leave when a group of Chinese came and sat down at a vacant able next to us.  Four very myopic young men all of whose glasses were worn part way down their nose.  It was fun to watch them continually pushing their spex back into place.  We had to order an extra round of drinks so as to prolong the enjoyment.</p><p></p><hr>

I went to USA last week due to eyes problems. Is peripheral vision limited vision field or are those cases with congenital or early onset of strabismus and so are cases with no clear prognosis due to severe refractive errors or other unusual errors? My dads been oriented to increase my glasses prism to a glued prism that will add 20º bases externa to the 15º I already have. Seems my eyes returned to over 75º deviations, after bilateral medial rectus recessions and bilateral lateral rectus resections since last year. At least my eyes sight remains the same as my last doc visiting, last April. As I said I've just learned last week (I've been at UCLA University, that I always had have cross and eccentric fixation and, if today I have monocular vision, whatever that means, I have that because of very limited vision field and very severe hypermetropia. Id already have difficult to get lenses to my +25, 00 and +31, 00 bottom, imagine how they are going to put 40 º of prisms. The lenses glasses costs will be rocketing the sky. Poor me dad. </p><p>If I am teased at school because of my glasses weirdness, imagine what am I going to expect from my new glasses and myself stern? Im already thinking to quit the school sports teams, but even to drop school too, because of the bullies I endure every single day.

<p><b>spexfan</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2005, 17:01</p><p>NJ, your experience is very similar to mine, except that I haven't 'crossed that line' fully. Can remember having crushes on girls with glasses at age 6. My girlfriend at the age of 12 became nearsighted and had to get glasses, which totally blew my mind. Like you, though, I keep love and lust *reasonably* separate and most of my recent girlfriends have had pretty good eyesight.  </p><p> </p><p>I've also wanted to wear glasses and now have a very small plus Rx. I used to get cheap plastic toy spectacle frames from a toy doctor's kit and fitted them with clear acetate 'lenses' when I was a kid!! Discovered GOC when I was about 24 and I can clearly remember slipping in the conatcts and the rush of crispness when I put on the high minus glasses afterwards.  </p><p> </p><p>A couple of my recent girlfriends got to know the GOC routine, though I would never, ever do it in front of friends or colleagues.  </p><p> </p><p>But NJ, you do GOC fulltime don't you? Do people genuinely think you're a high hyperope?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2005, 12:00</p><p>No, I didn't. I guess love and lust have occupied different territories in my mind. </p><p> </p><p>Even at 47, she can read the fine print of the New Yorker without glasses. But hopefully someday soon she will need spex.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2005, 17:56</p><p>Like Filthy, I've been thinking about being an OO all of my life. I remember being fascinated by glasses even as a pre-schooler. There was a cashier at the local drug store who wore myodiscs, and I could not take my eyes off of her. Every major crush I had throughout my school years were on girls with glasses. In middle school, I totally fell in love with a high myope, and had many many affairs with glasses wearing girls well into my adulthood. Perhaps my favorite was a 35 year old blond, quite good looking even without her glasses, who wore a significant plus Rx,I'd guess around +6 or so,  and had an executive bifocal in just one lens! She had a lazy eye as a kid, and so could not see out of her other eye. She saw no reason to pay for two bifocal lenses. She was hot!! </p><p> </p><p>In addition, I have *always* wanted to wear glasses myself, and found ways to get low Rx glasses since the second grade. Finally, in graduate school, I started doing GOC, and despite the pleasure I felt doing this, I finally realized that I had crossed some sort of line, though it beat wearing very thick glasses without contacts! Now, I live a life of being a high hyperope with the help of GOC, and totally enjoy it, though it does still cause me to think about how ridiculous this obsession is.  </p><p> </p><p>Why do I do this? I have no f**king idea!! If I could find the off switch I would certainly flip it. My life would have been, and would continue to be, far simpler if I were not an OO. I still can't take my eyes off of cute babes in glasses, though as surgery and contacts become the norm, there are fewer distractions out there. Every now and then, though, I spot a babe who, under the right circumstances, could put my marriage vows in jeopardy.  </p><p> </p><p>Like being gay, I suppose, no one would freely and willingly choose this. </p><p></p><hr>

I remember at a school Christmas disco back in 1971,there was a girl who wore glasses in my year who I fancied, turned up that night wearing new glasses, she looked so sexy!! Being the early 70s, they were big octagonal gold metal frames and what I know now to be plano fronted lenses. They complimented her jewelery very well and seemed to make her sparkle from head to toe. We danced all night and near the end,we decided to take a stroll outside, I commented on how well her new glasses looked, and she said she was happy with them and could see much better, although she didn;t like how thick they were and the weight. We eventually kissed, I wish I could return to 1971</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2005, 08:37</p><p>I haven't seen anyone say that to want glasses is sick.  Perhaps I haven't read far enough back in the archives.  Or, more likely, perhaps you are just exaggerating the other side's position to make it easier to write off. </p><p>Wanting to have poorer vision so that you can wear glasses is indeed baffling, as the poster below remarked.  I can't understand my own attraction to women in glasses, and I've been thinking and reading about it pretty much all my life.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Luke</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2005, 08:05</p><p>T2, JD, --, </p><p> </p><p>I doubt anyone here can give a good explanation of *why*, really, they want to experience being, pretend to be, or really be highly nearsighted.  But I think there are a few things you should realize, which might give a little more understanding...  I think this "weird" interest begins for many people with a curiosity about "what it's like" to be really nearsighted.  It grows from there into a stronger interest, attraction, or fetish.  Something else that I think is important to keep in mind is that the glasses fetishist generally isn't looking for the experience of being teased by the schoolyard bully...that's an experience real high-myopes have that naturally gives more negative feelings towards your glasses, but if you could skip that altogether, being real nearsighted wouldn't be quite as bad.  Of course, there are "all the comments", but some people actually like getting this kind of attention.   I don't know if this helps, but at any rate, I really think the attitude "I'd do anything to get rid of my glasses, so I think you're sick for wanting them" really isn't a great attitude.  I think the fact that some people like strong glasses is a really good thing for people who have no choice but to wear them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>--</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2005, 14:12</p><p>It is much different to temporarily make yourself a "high myope" than to have to cope permanently</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>T2</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2005, 13:15</p><p>JD.  Thanks.  I am sure we are the minority here on this.  Unlike you, contacts have never been an option so for 16 years or so it has been specs or nothing for me!  I can assure you that after the age of about 15 I could no longer function bare eyed and it was stronger glasses all the way from then!

<p><b>JD</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2005, 12:04</p><p>I've had to wear strong glasses for most of my life.  When contacts were an option, I switched there.  I spend most of my time in contacts.  When I have to go out in glasses friends notice the strength of my glasses.  It never fails that a comment is made.  I prefer to hide my glasses as much as possible and avoid the annoying comments that so many tend to say.  For this reason, I find it very hard to understand why someone whould want to make their glasses stronger.  It baffles me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>T2</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2005, 10:49</p><p>Very helpful.  Thanks Matt.

<p><b>mattp</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2005, 08:33</p><p>Hi T2-- </p><p> </p><p>From my years of reading this board and my own experience, I've learned GOC means a number of different things. </p><p> </p><p>Most commonly for the inquisitive, it means wearing contacts that worsen vision and then corrective lenses to "fix" that vision.  My myopia is in the -4.75 range, but I sometimes wonder what it would be like to need glasses in you or your brother's range of minus the mid to upper teens; I could be fitted with contacts that would add to my own myopia so I could experience higher levels. </p><p> </p><p>Another kind of GOC is what you suggest.  For some reason, contacts can't fully correct one's vision, so they only partially correct and glasses finish the job. </p><p> </p><p>A third kind of GOC I have used for years myself.  When I first needed reading glasses at thirty, I was used to wearing contacts to correct my myopia.  I got (and continue to have) </p><p>reading glasses that I wear when reading with my contacts in.  This is in lieu of bifocals or trifocals. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, hope this helps--Matt</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>T2</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2005, 08:18</p><p>Think I'd better say something about that last entry.  I'm new to all this and have understood GOC to mean that someone who has normal healthy eyes puts in contacts to "make themselves" myopic (or whatever) and then has to get a high glasses prescription.  But from a message I received today from elsewhere I gather that very high myopes might have the option of wearing strong contacts so that their specs are not quite so thick. Is that the case - or does it only affect a small number?  My last entry was made before I knew much, so excuse me! </p><p>T2</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>T2</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2005, 08:11</p><p>I hope it's not going to offend but for someone who's worn specs with a high prescription nearly all his life it strikes me as kind of odd that there are people who, having good eyesight go and spoil it by wearing contact lenses and high minus glasses.  Through the 16 years of being thought different and called names by my "friends' what would I not have done to be able to see better!  Having had to avoid games where glasses couldn't be worn and having always to look for a seat near the front of class -I'd have done anything just for a bit more sight!  I can't think why you are all so keen to join us speccy blind people.  You seem to get fun out of it, but for someone who's lived it, it has not -although there have been times when not seeing has led to hilarious mix-ups and surprising results.  but maybe that's for another thread.</p><p></p><hr>

I had a bit of trouble seeing my 20/1600 E that I made myself, its absolutely huge at 27.2 inches! What can you see at 20/11000? Ive always wondered!

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2005, 18:03</p><p>What I have read seems to be in line with your statement about eyeball length presbyopia_23.  And of course, when you drop your -4.5D glasses down your nose, you really don't change your focal length enough - you just get more minimization.  You are quite correct in saying that if a person had to wear -35D glasses, 15mm away from their eye, they would have les minimization and better vision with -30D glasses worn at the 10mm point.  Of course these people are very few and far between. </p><p> </p><p>Minus contact lenses go up to around -50D.  Anything over about -15D is done as a myodisc effect - in other words the portion of the lens that has the power is very small, and is directly in front of your eye.  This is how they can make them thin enough to be worn.  And a plus lens is much the same, with a thinner carrier, and then the thick plus in the center. I have some plus contacts up to -30D and you can definately feel the bump.( +30 = -45D glasses for me anyway) </p><p> </p><p>I am glad I am teaching you some things. Thats what us old guys are supposed to do.  Nice to have someone who takes notice. </p><p> </p><p>There are quite a few new stories on Bobby's web site, and they are marked as new there. </p><p> </p><p>Hey, has anyone heard from Bobby - He is markedly silent recently</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>presbyopia_23</b>&nbsp;31 May 2005, 01:58</p><p>I dont know how much the eyeball size varies among humans but I heard the normal eye should be 24mm long, add 1mm each -2.5 diopters, subtract 1mm for +2.5. Of course if the cornea and lense are too thin/thick the eye doesnt have to be very long/short then. I think the size of the eye may be an illusion by how wide one keeps their eyes open, big or small eyelids. </p><p> </p><p>"If a -30D myope wore their glasses at a 10mm distance from their eye, and someone else wore their glasses at 15 mm away from their eye, the second person would require a -35D prescription" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>wow I learn alot! I barely see any difference by moving my glasses further from my eye except more minfication, things dont get blurrier, just minify more. Wouldnt a -30 be better off wearing -30 closer vs. -35 further? Less minification that way if anything else. I remember in one of your stories it was mentioned very high myopes need to wear their glasses just perfect, if they move even 1mm anywhere you get blur. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"So, I suppose that a -80D myope who could not get their glasses any closer to their eye than 12.5 mm would not be able to see past the lenses of their glasses. Of course, I would not wish this amount of myopia on anyone - even to settle this point of argument." </p><p> </p><p>I wouldnt wish myopia on anyone, except on enemies or teach someone a hard lesson(in your story of forced GoC, loved that one) How high do minus contacts go to without being so thick its downright painful to insert? In one of your stories you mentioned -20d contact. That would be = to -25d glasses. Maybe theres +20 contacts too. Try em on an xtreme myope(-40d or worse) to add another -25d(if +20 works that way too)of course it would be an expensive experment and youd need "connections" as well to carry this ultimate GoC experment. I dont even know how expensive such thick glasses would be. In one of your story it was mentioned $500 per lense for a very unusual and high pescription. The contacts would be alot cheaper id recon. I would venture to assume he would see only a partial correction which gets progressivately less the further they sit from his natural focal point. I tried expermenting by holding my glasses further away for a rough approximation. I guess if someone is over -60d he would have no choice but have his glasses lenses extend just a few mm away from touching his eyeball and ignore his eyelashes hitting the lense. If he can tolerate contacts, he will need to somehow insert them(hard if you cant see yourself doing em)then -60d glasses over them(one of your story has this example)But I can say life wont be easy for xtreme myopes, period(you even have one story on that "life of a high myope") </p><p> </p><p>I look forward to seeing your additional 16 stories, would be easy to find if theres "new" next to them :) how old are you by the way and are you a myope yourself? im 23 and about -4.5 which would be considered almost nothing in some of your stories lol.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;30 May 2005, 06:51</p><p>I honestly don't know Puffin.  I have used this large eyes in a couple of stories as being very myopic eyes.  But a couple of the most nearsighted laadies I have known were small ladies with small eyeballs - in proportion to their size.  Maybe someone who checks in here could actually know the answer to this?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;30 May 2005, 01:39</p><p>I admit it's a bit unlikely - but wouldn't you get an increase in eyeball length with a larger eyeball? (and the bit you see out of stays the same size)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;29 May 2005, 20:52</p><p>Well, presbyopia_23, a -5D myope has a focal point of 200mm, and a -10D myope has their focal point at 100mm. And, as you go up in power, like for -20D, you get a focal point of 50mm.  By the time a high myope reaches -30D the focal point is only 33.3 mm, and at -40D the focal point becomes 25mm. If a -30D myope wore their glasses at a 10mm distance from their eye, and someone else wore their glasses at 15 mm away from their eye, the second person would require a -35D prescription - providing their eyes had exactly the same amount of myopia. This becomes even more exaggerated at -50D, where the focal point now is 20mm, and then at -60D the focal point is only 16mm, a difference of only 4 mm for -10D. And as we discussed earlier, a -70D myope has a focal point of 14.3mm, so it is a valid supposition that a -60D myope who wore their glasses at 11mm away from their eye to be able to see through a -60D lens could quite conceivably require a -70D lens if they slid their glasses down their nose by 4.3mm.  By taking the calculations and projecting them even further, a -80D myope - if there was one would have their focal point at 12.5mm away from their eye.  So, I suppose that a -80D myope who could not get their glasses any closer to their eye than 12.5 mm would not be able to see past the lenses of their glasses.  Of course, I would not wish this amount of myopia on anyone - even to settle this point of argument. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for your kind words about my tales.  When I started my website, I was forced to call on a young computer wizz who hung around here to help me put my stories on my site.  He did a great job, but I am no further ahead in being able to post stories without his help, so i took the easy road, and I have been sending my stories to Bobby for posting on his site.  However, Bobby has some of mine that are ready for posting, but hasn't done it yet.  I have about 16 stories finished and ready for release.  It would do you absolutely no good to send me your story I am afraid. </p><p> </p><p>And Puffin, I don't know if your supposition about large eyes would stand up.  Lots of people with big eyes never become myopic, and those that do would have to have an increase in eyeball length much the same as someone with smaller eyes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;29 May 2005, 02:49</p><p>Another thought on this "minus 60 debate" - if the eyeball was very large compared to a normal-sized lens, you could still get high myopia like this without so much of a problem with the retina - the back of the eyeball would be normally curved, just too far away for the lens.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>presbyopia_23</b>&nbsp;28 May 2005, 21:51</p><p>Does wearing them a bit further really make -10d difference? There would be more minification, that I know. What would happen if his natural vision is less than the distance the glasses were worn? In one of your stories you said "for any usable vision" Would be interesting to know. Would he get no correction? partial?  </p><p> </p><p>LOL at that -100 that would be just crazy! His focal point would be just a single centimeter! But besides that, could the human eye be that myopic? Is there something that prevents the eye from ever, ever being worse than -xx something?  </p><p> </p><p>I enjoy reading your stories. You know alot about vision and I am also interested. Got any new stories comming up? Can I write a story and have it put in your website? :) thanks again</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;28 May 2005, 05:23</p><p>that was supposed to read "any amount" of change</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;28 May 2005, 05:22</p><p>This is where it becomes almost riduiculous. The difference in focal length between -60D and -70D as you pointed out is around 2.3mm. And yamuony of change in the length of the eyeball in a person who was already -60D could have them wearing -70D glasses. And also, a person who perhaps needed -60D might feel more comfortable with a -70D prescription because they could wear their glasses a bit further from the eye.  And, also some people can not wear their glasses at the 11 to 12 mm range from the eye, so one person could be a -60D myope with glasses worn 11 mm away from the eye, and another person who had to wear thsir glasses 14 mm away from the eye might reguire -70D. </p><p>There was a posting on Science Medicine and Vision a few years ago about the strongest possible glasses, and someone said they had heard of -100D, but I find this to be impossible.  Anyway, at anything over about 40D they inner lens mucst be thicker than normal, and the cornea must also be steeper than normal, along with the increased eyeball length.  The retina's would also be paper thin from being stretched that much.  Good to see that someone still reads my stories.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;28 May 2005, 03:00</p><p>It's not just length of eyeball that produces myopia, it might be thickness of the lens or it might be denser than normal - like a high index lens, but working against you not in your favour. </p><p>I think if someone had -70 of myopia then they might be offered some sort of surgery to bring the myopia down - perhaps removing the lens in the eye. And the retina doesn't like that sort of curvature. High myopes tend to have problems with their retinas falling off, and that's not good for vision.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>presbyopia_23</b>&nbsp;27 May 2005, 23:16</p><p>I am curious how strong is it possible to make glasses to. Someone a few posts down said +50 to -60! I read some glasses stories and they say -60 is about the strongest they can make because your near point would only be 2/3 of an inch or 16.6cm from your eye! Is it also impossible to make glasses thicker than -60? What if someone is worse than -60(if thats even possible) wouldnt his eye be like twice as long as normal? Would he still be able to see a thing if he was -70 and wore -70 glasses(if they can be made this thick) </p><p> </p><p>As for plus glasses, I read that its very rare to be +15 because your eye would be very short, only like 3/4 of normal! How high a hyperope can one be? What else would make one more than +15 besides short eye and flat corneas? Is there a such thing as myodisc but in a + verson? I often see magnifying glasses(not the glasses kind but the lope kind) that have a small disc on the bottom for "close up" zooming. </p><p> </p><p>Finally whats the highest myope/hyperope you know? whats the highest possible in theory? I have heard +25-+30 is the most farsighted any human can ever be and -50-65 is the most myopic one can ever be but ive never seen anyone worse than -20 or so myself </p><p></p><hr>

I remember a few years ago seeing in the local newspaper a story about two boys - probably brothers - of about early teenage years. The story said something about them having an "eye-rolling" condition that if unchecked would leave them blind. Some local optician had prescribed glasses, which it said were the solution.

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2004, 05:03</p><p>With "old fashioned" ie pre-hiindex myodisks there's a sort of tradeoff between what they look like at the front, arguably a bit worse  </p><p>(or, perhaps rather "odd" if you've never seen them before) depending on the prescription against a more obvious benefit in thickness and weight. </p><p> </p><p>These days some people go for myodisks and hi index together, and get a really thin lens eg 4mm for around minus 16.

<p><b>Lots of Rings</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2004, 02:10</p><p>Hello all, I am Russian girl, 19 years of age, with shortsighted eyes.  My glasses make lots of rings around edge that I do not think are attractive.  I just had eye examination.   I am wearing glasses -10,50 dioptres but eye doctor says to see properly I must haveglasses -11,75 dioptres.  I know this will create greater rings.  How can rings be made to diminish to make my glasses be more attractive?  I am thankful for your suggestions.</p><p></p><hr>

I would sort of hold off as long as possible before going back to have stronger lenses prescribed, for the pleasure of the big difference the new glasses made, everything looking a little smaller but so crisp and crystal clear again. People who have normal vision don't know that pleasure. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David_Llewellyn</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2004, 15:20</p><p>question: there are numerous pix around of such things. Briefly they are lenses in which on both sides of the lens there is a (generally) circular bowl cut which usually does not occupy the entire width of the lens, and whose size is independent of the frame size. Contrast to single myodiscs in which there is a circular bowl cut on one side, typically the back, but the front is generally either flat (plano) or concave like a bowl, but extending across the entire lens surface. </p><p>Sometimes the two bowls are identical in diameter, although I feel this creates a problem in that the image of the front bowl seen by the wearer is minimized (made smaller) by the action of the back bowl, so that the wearer can see a smaller bowl nested inside the larger (the region between being useless but adding its distortions, etc.). I think a better design is to use a larger front and smaller back bowl so that the minimized front bowl appears about the same size as the back. </p><p>My -43 D double myos have a 36mm front bowl and a 28mm back bowl. </p><p>BTW, not to be too critical: whenever the word "disc" refers to an optical element (e.g., myodisc, compact disc, etc.) it is spelled with a "c". Whenever it refers to a magnetic element (e.g., hard disk) it is spelled with a "k".</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>question</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2004, 10:19</p><p>What do double myodisks look like and can you descibe these?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David_Llewellyn</b>&nbsp;03 Sep 2004, 15:15</p><p>tortoise - thanks for price info. You are probably right, I asked for the -43 Rx which is outside their normal range. </p><p>Blended myos don't look all that different from unblended. A typical computer photo is not going to tell you too much, you have to be there. The big difference is in the feel, with the blended ones you can feel a softly rounded edge. Unblended you can feel a much sharper edge. You may get a slightly larger field of view with unblended, since to blend the buffing must inevitably cut into the bowl to some degree, but probably not much. </p><p>I have heard that Younger Optics no longer makes the standard blended single myodisc that everybody used for Rxs up to -35 or so (like the -34 ones in my photos)... it's too bad because it's a very inexpensive solution and provides pretty good vision. Aesthetically I think there is very little difference b/w single &amp; double myos, and the field of view is definitely less with a double myo, but for really high Rxs a double myo is essential for the same reason as going to myos in the first place - reducing an otherwise unwearable lens thickness to that which is merely unpleasant. Now it seems that O4L uses a double-myo design for all high scripts, in a fairly small bowl (I think 28mm is their standard), which can make the lens quite thin, and if held very close to the eye has not as restrictive a field of view as it might seem.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brille</b>&nbsp;02 Sep 2004, 02:29</p><p>I agree with David_Llewellyn that there are far too many rectangular frames to choose from nowadays. I think myodiscs look better in round frames as the corrective zone is harmonious to the frame.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;01 Sep 2004, 18:47</p><p>Hi Davi_Ll, These glasses cost $207US and could have been $20 less with alloy or plastic frames.  I chose titanium ones.  I just ordered off the "menu" so to speak, it goes up to -40 and the "myothin" lenses are high index glass.  If your order was priced higher I think it would have been because you wanted a higher Rx or lens style/material that they don't ordinarily stock. </p><p>The blended double myodisc lenses make the carrier part of the lens a very complex shape with interesting optical effects.  Overall I'm happy with these specs.  I like smallish metal oval or rectangular frames but I still find it a crapshoot to order online because you only see a picture and can't try them on. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David_Llewellyn</b>&nbsp;01 Sep 2004, 11:39</p><p>tortoise: May I inquire as to the price O4L charged you for your myodiscs? When I asked them for a quote it seemed very high. My -43 double unblended myos were made by Sears (!) (of course, it really went to a buy-out lab) and were quite inexpensive, and very well made (in CR-39 of course). </p><p>One problem which seems fairly unique to me is that I dislike the frame selection all these shops offer, which seems limited to rectangles in every conceivable color and some ovals like the -43 ones in the photo album mentioned below. But I prefer round shapes (such as the -34s in the album) which these shops just don't carry anymore. Even large selections like Lenscrafter's seems to be 1000 rects, 100 absurdly tiny ovals, and zero rounds. Enuf whining already!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David_Llewellyn</b>&nbsp;01 Sep 2004, 11:34</p><p>tortoise: Thanks for your positive feedback! </p><p>I've never heard of double blended myodiscs. I've got single blended ones, single unblended, and double unblended. I don't really see much advantage to the blending, except that in certain cases the glasses are held so close to the face that the unblended may be more uncomfortable due to the sharp edge. This would only apply to the ocular side of the lens of course. I suppose the blended ones, by rolling off the sharp edge, have less chance of damage to the edge.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David_Llewellyn</b>&nbsp;01 Sep 2004, 11:28</p><p>OK, I have posted a bunch of my photos to a yahoo group that I think is available to everybody: it is called glassesovercontacts. Join that group. In the "photos" section there is an album called "Roderick_Llewellyn" (Roderick is what I am called these days)... In there are various photos of myself wearing -34 blended myodiscs (from a few years ago when I had short hair) and -43 double myodiscs (more recently, with long hair). </p><p>Sooner or later I may get around to taking photos of my strongest pair, which is a -53 (I wear them with +30 contacts!), but they don't look that impressive from a thickness perspective as they are in a high-index material with very small 20mm bowls. They are thinner than many -10s you see out there.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;01 Sep 2004, 07:55</p><p>I too was once innocent about the possibility of really strong glasses - I remember daydreaming about -20 glasses about 20 years ago, then instantly dismissing them as impossible, as I thought nobody could need glasses that strong. Now, I know better, thanks to the internet, and this site in particular.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;31 Aug 2004, 20:57</p><p>Hi David_Ll,  It's always interesting to read your posts. At the moment I am wearing new -36 glasses (GOC) from O4L.  The lenses are interesting hghly blended double myodisc; in other words there is a blended concave bowl on the fronts as well as the backs of the lenses.  Vision is quite good but even more surprising is that, to me anyway, the appearance is not bad at all. These are the first glasses I have had which give me a really serious feeling of high myopia.  It's really quite funny to think that back in highschool etc. I thought that girls with -10 glasses or so were experiencing this sort of blur and distortion etc.   :-)</p><p></p><hr>

I've seen a post very similar to "foureyes" in similar European notation and grammar, but with plus power instead of minus. Quite a coincidence!!! </p><p>BTW, concerning glasses so thick it takes light 15 minutes to get thru them. This is very funny, and reminds me of a story that Richard Feynmann was cought running a red light, and he tells the judge that he saw the light as green due to the Doppler effect shifting red to green as he approached it. Of course he would have had to have been driving probably 80% of the speed of light for this effect to occur, which at some $3/mph penalty exceeding the limit would imply a fine of over a billion dollars. </p><p>There is also a set of stories by Bob Shaw about "slow glass" which has the properties mentioned. People would expose a piece of such glass to, say, an African veldt for a year, (a piece of glass "one year thick"); then move it to their living room window. Now for the next year they would look out over the beautiful veldt before their tawdry urban world would again come thru the glass. </p><p>One problem as pointed out by Shaw with "slow glass" is that the energy density contained therein is huge. It's like a bomb waiting to go off! </p><p>Another note: since the index of refraction of a material is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to that in the given material, for light to take 15 mins to go thru implies an enormous index, right? Unfortunately, due to "impedance mismatching" almost none of the light impinging on the lens would actually get thru.

In regular plastic you would likely have a circle around the optical portion, giving it a myodisc effect and with hi index, it would likely take most of the lens area for it. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2004, 18:59</p><p>Pam, just wondering what your current rx is.  Starting at 17, it's unusual to become high minus.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pam</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2004, 07:35</p><p>My boyfriend showed me what an interest people have in glasses. I hated wearing mine, but reading these letters makes such a difference. When I first met my boyfriend he commented on how nice my glasses looked on me, and how they suited me. Unless you are a glasses wearer, you do not know how much a remark like that is appreciated. We have been together now for six years, and my pescription has changed 4 times during this period. Am now quite high minus, and blind as a bat without them. Im 25 years old now, but optician tells me my eyes are still changing. Started wearing them full time at 17. Knew needed them badly before that, but refused to get them. But on leaving school, my first job was in a printers office. My boss said after my trial period, the job was mine on one condition. That I get my eyes tested. </p><p>And thats how it started. First pair were R-3.50 L-3.00. Optician said was one of the strongest first time perscription he had issued for a long time. Really cannot explain the difference when came out of the shop with them, it was like looking at another world.  </p><p>My motto now, if you need glasses, go and get them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2004, 01:46</p><p>Hi all. I have thought about all these threads, ref my glasses and my partner not liking me in them. We sat down yesterday, and i went through the lot, let him see what other people think. I believe it has done some good, he admitted that he never knew how bad my eyes were without my glasses, though he knew they had been changing over the years. That evening as we were on our way to our local for a drink, I stopped and asked him to put on my glasses and tell me what he could see. (Todd gave me this idea) After a brief why ect, he did just that. I pointed up to our local and asked him what he saw, his reply just a blur. Ok, can you see me , again yes but very blurry. Ok said i, what can you see. Reply, not a lot the whole lot is just a hazy blur. I took back my glasses and put them back on. Then told the idiot, that what he saw in my glasses, is how i see without them. When we arrived home that night, over a nightcap, he apologised for anything that he had said before about not liking me in glasses. He was man enought to admit, standing in the street with my glasses on seeing just a blur, made him realise thats how i saw without them. Anyway, upshot is, he is taking me to the opticians this week and going to treat me to new frames with high index lenses. Thanks to all for all support from a happy long sighted lady. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2004, 10:41</p><p>Puffin and Tortoise, my g/f wears her glasses all the time, both for work and socialising, her glasses do not come into the equation, i fell in love with a beautiful person,infact when I first meet her she was wearing contacts, it was only when we started to live together after a year did I know she wearing contacts. One night after a hard long day at work her eyes looked sore and inflamed, she casually mentioned she hated contacts, she also told me she looked so ugly in her glasses, I simply said wear whats comfortable and if that means wearing your glasses its no big deal.My g/f was surprised i had no hang ups about glasses. The next day we went to the optician had new glasses prescribed with high index lenses, a nice designer frame, from the day she started to wear her new glasses she has never had a problem wearing glasses and is now free from the discomfort of contacts. To me she is beautiful and thats all that matters to her. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2004, 06:23</p><p>Some of these GWG's have worn glasses for so long it#s like they've become part of them - nobody would imagine them without them, and so it might just be possible to say that liking the glasses is similar to saying you like the person - if you want to stretch things that way.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2004, 19:22</p><p>Mark, your girlfriend's glassses are very strong and , since you agree with her that this is an unattractive feature, I respect the fact that you love her anyway, for all her other attributes.  Good stuff!  I hope you don't insist that she not wear glasses when you go out or enforce any similar requirements.  </p><p>Your post brings up an interesting question for all GWG lovers.  Are you attracted to the fact that she believes her glasses to be an unattractive feature?  If she thought that her glasses made her hotter than ever (and thus more powerful) would that be a turn on for you?   </p><p>I hope to get some answers on this question...... t</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2004, 18:22</p><p>Still I don,t care what you may think thats your opinion,I stress no woman who wears thick glasses thinks she is attractive, and I,m sure most women in here would admit that.As I said my girl friend wears fairly strong plus glasses, her rx when she had her last eye test over 2 years ago was +9.25, with reading glasses + 13.75, she will tell you she feels far from attractive wearing them, and suggest women who say they look attractive in thick glasses are being brave, and find it hard to admit they don,t like their thick glasses, and deep down no woman thinks its a compliment to be told her thick glasses are attractive.

I am sure most women who wear heavy lensed glasses when the look in the mirror and see those plate glass windows on their nose, think shock horror are my glasses as thick as I see them in the mirror.Ladies in glasses have personalites, character, interests, feelings, and the last item they would like drawn attention to is their glasses. Look at the lady not the glasses, and you will find a lovely human being behind the glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

Would they be "willing" parties if they knew how their photos are being observed?  Do you consider them "willing" because they are oblivious to what is going on?  This is much different than say, Playboy or Hustler, where the women know that guys will oogle and drool over their images, but do you think that when people post their images to Webshots and the like that they expect people to be masturbating to their images?  Sorry if that sounds a bit raw, but I am trying to point out that it does not appear to matter if they are willing or not here, but rather if they are attractive or not and wearing glasses thick enough to raise our desires.  So to conclude, is sexual fantasy truly "best" when both parties are "willing" or is it okay if one of the parties is completely oblivious?</p><p></p><hr>

I wear -10, with -2.75 left, and -9.50 with -2.75 right.  (I think I've read this prescription correctly.) </p><p> </p><p>I'm 28, and you wouldn't call me a traditionalist.  But, I've found I do best with strong older men.  In the work arena I'm professional, and I handle high powered guys all the time.  I'm sort of known as somebody who doesn't take any prisoners.  But, for some reason, at home I need a take-charge guy.  This may sound strange, but I need somebody who NEVER takes no for an answer. </p><p> </p><p>I meet guys all the time, and think they have potential for an LTR, but they usually turn out to be thoughtful, and sensitive.  Where are all the cave men?  Help!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2004, 15:51</p><p>aw, and if you had read MY posts more closely, you would have noticed that I differenteated (ack, bad spelling) between Curious explaining it as a fetish as opposed to the outdated notion that a woman is put on this Earth to please a man.  As he (Curious) clarified his position, I understood more where he was coming from.  Although the controlling language (in terms of pleasing the man) served to detract from his fetish explanation. </p><p> </p><p>Just my opinion, of course.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Please Me With NO Glasses</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2004, 07:03</p><p>this message is to guest and Sheila.  Both of you need to read the message boards closer and you will see that Curious knows what he is talking about.  i am not talking about the pleasing the man part, but instead about the not wearing glasses fetish.  i believe there is a desire to dominate by asking a woman not to wear her glasses, and seeing her go through the inability to see.  Honestly I find it quite stimulating to watch a woman fumble and struggle to see without her glasses, even if that sounds a bit strange.  Curious' desire to dominate seems to have spread over to controlling a woman completely, but i wanted to explain how i think he got there.  if you read these boards you will see that others (although probably a minority in this group) enjoy that fetish quite strongly.  therefore neither of you should react so strongly against people because you do not understand their fetish of dominance and control over the glasses wearing!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2004, 03:46</p><p>on my previous post, the first sentence should have referred to the "fetish" of wanting someone to go withOUT glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Later on in the post, I said where their glasses, it should have read wear their glasses.  I do that a lot!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2004, 03:40</p><p>Curious, if you explain it as a "fetish", then I can explain that I understand the fetish of wanting someone to wear their glasses (as a manifestation of the fantasy/fetish thing). </p><p> </p><p>What I object to, is the notion that someone (a woman) must "please her man" in a way that is very much against what she wants to do (or in this case, what physically is very difficult to do, go without visual correction). </p><p> </p><p>Sexual fantasy is best accomplished when both parties are willing.  That does not sound like the case here.  In terms of the fetish aspect, I do believe we all have our fetishes, but I am not about "controlling" someone to do something that is not what they want to do (unless it is trying to get my husband to do chores around the house, etc., but I don't think we are in that realm).  To me a fetish is a "secret thrill" that sometimes gets to be a little visible.  Getting a secret thrill or even an express turn-on when seeing/making love to someone very glasses, I can understand as a fetish.  Forcing someone not to wear glasses when they need to, is not something I ever would deign to do. </p><p> </p><p>Daffy, you will not find me among the posters insisting that people where their glasses when they don't want to (with the exception of glasses needed for safety of others concern, like driving).  It is their business.  I am not a glasses fetishist but I can tell you I cringe at somethings my husband chooses to wear in terms of fashion.  I do try gently to steer him into, what I consider to be nicer looking attire.  But force him to wear something he doesn't want to----is something I don't do. </p><p> </p><p>This discussion, in my opinion, would have gone better from the get-go...if Curious' statements about a woman needing to "please her man".  That detracted (it seems for quite a few of us), from the I would prefer you to go without glasses because its a fetish of mine aspect (not that I agree with that either). </p><p> </p><p>In the spirit of clarification, and I hope non-offensive discussion.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curious</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2004, 01:13</p><p>It's refreshing to see someone that understands the points I am trying to make, daffy.  As far as "sides," I'd better liken it sharing my perception of this fetish.  "Sides" sounds like there is some sort of battle or heavy handed debate ongoing, which there is not.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carole</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2004, 06:41</p><p>I hated those glasses, I thought I wished I had stayed without glasses, yet on the other hand it was marvellous to see the world the blue skies, the beautiy off lowers, see expressions on peoples faces, read books, go to films it was a whole new world being able to see. I still could not come to terms with my glasses, they made me shy and withdrawn,I felt a simpleton. I hated to go for interviews for jobs, I couldnot look people straight in the eye because I thought they were making silly comments about my glasses. 22 years ago I meet husband I used to question why a nice handsome guy could ever want to date an ugly duckling like me, he always said I did not marry an exterior I married the living person inside you.6 years ago my husband made an appointment for me at the optician, I thought this is strange but did not question him why he had made the appointment. The frames he chose for me where gold metal round in shape and medium in size, I could not see the frames on me but they felt so light and comfortable. A fornight later I had a phone call to say my glasses were ready, gosh what a surprise the lenses were so thin, I put my new glasses on looked in the mirror and could not believe I was now wearing glasses that looked super on me, the thick lenses of old had gone, the big power rings were gone and the cut in on my face was barely noticeable, I felt a new woman there and then.exited I rush home to my hubby and his first words were( Darling your glasses look wonderful), in the last 6 years I have become confident,no more silly negatives about myself or image. I need reading glasses also , my husband spent almost a thousand pounds on my glasses, he was in the process of buying a new motor cycle, instead he spent the money on my glasses, and told me it was cheap at the priceto see the huge difference in me mentally. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carole</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2004, 06:19</p><p>Hi posters, I,m new to all this,I,m a 48 year old married lady from London,may I add happily married. I suppose from about the age of 4 I knew there was something wrong with my eyes as I used to bump into things could not see pictures in child picture books, even eating my food i was always making a mess because i could not see food on the plate, athough as 4 year old child you think what your seeing is normal.I was 8 before it was discovered I had very poor vision, a very kind school teacher noticed I was not performing at school,decided to try and encourage me to attain my potenial in lessons. I day she causally said Carole can you see the black board from where you are stitting I said no, she sent me home with a note for my mother to take me to the doctor to have an eye test, the eye test proved I was fairly short sighted, my rx read - 12 with 2.75 astigmatism. </p><p>Instead of being prescribed glasses I spent the rest of my education in a school for blind children. On leaving school I went to my local optician he was a super guy when he heard my story about being sent to a blind school he was shocked. My family was very poor, so I had national health service glasses prescribed, pink round frames with very thick lenses with huge power rings they looked awful, although for the first time in my life I was able to see clearly. to be continued.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2004, 01:29</p><p>Never imagined that when I mentioned that my partner did not like me in glasses, and there was no way I was going to go out without them, it would cause so much interest.  </p><p>Perhaps when he comes home, Ill show him all these posts, maybe it will help him to love my glasses instead of hating them. Anyway getting back to the original thread, its nearly a week since I have been wearing my monovision glasses. It has just got better and better, Should have tried this years ago. The biggest advantage for me is at work. I work in a busy London Railway Information office. From looking close at any time tables, to looking across the station at the arrivals/departure board for any changes that have been made.can you imagine in one days work, how many times I had to change my glasses, it must have been dozens and dozens. Not any more, it really is great. Anyone else who cant wear progressive or bifocal, go for it.  </p><p>Will wait a few more weeks then order the Hi index. Thanks all you guys and girls for all the help you have given me.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sandy</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2004, 21:27</p><p>Curious, I have a question for you, do you wear glasses?  If you do, how would you feel if your significant other told you not to wear them while you were going out on the town.  My ex-husband was very obssessed with my specs.  I had several pairs that I wore every day.  Sometimes, I wondered why there were fingerprints on the lenses, etc.  I was a fanatic of keeping my glasses very clean and I took very good care of them.  You might want total control of your woman, but there are other guys out there that are not as controlling.  My current other is one of those people.  He is very caring and sensitive and accepts me for who I am including my glasses.  My feeling is that if Sheila needs her glasses to see, she should be allowed to wear them, especially at night, because it is harder to see at night.  I can tell you from experience.  Your last sentence is correct, maybe Shelia should go find someone else.  Take care. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curious</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2004, 18:10</p><p>I must ask why you find my statement's so offensive to you.  Is it because you do not share my view, or is it because secretly we all do wish we could control what women do to turn us on and you resent me for actually vocalizing it?  We talk about wanting to see women in thick glasses, liking to see them squint around looking for glasses, no lasik, and asking women to allow us to try their glasses on.  Who says we don't want an element of control in these fantasies?  If we did not, then it would not be as pleasurable.   </p><p> </p><p>My whole point is that Shelia should allow her husband to enjoy the fantasy if that is what he desires.  Frankly if she feels so resentful to him for asking, I question what her motivation would be to continue to stay with him.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2004, 17:36</p><p>I am not "afraid" of opinions other than my own.  But I find that Curious'  strong statements about women being put on this earth (am paraphrasing) to please their man to be so extreme that I question Curious' motive in posting them.  He (I'm assuming he's a he) seems to be posting them purely to get a reaction, a "rise", especially from females. </p><p> </p><p>I enjoy a good debate as much as the next person.  I find Curious' statements blatently offensive, not even anything to debate.  That is why I have not responded before now. </p><p> </p><p>To answer your question about the LASIK.  While I would never undergo LASIK (I don't believe in invasive surgery on healthy eyes or other organs, unless there is an extreme medical reason why it is necessary), I would never DREAM of asking my significant other to decline doing LASIK if that is what he wanted, even if I very much liked him in glasses.  It is his body to do with as he pleases.  There are many different aspects to relationships, but I believe that each person in a relationship retains some "rights" to independence and independent decision-making.  Relationships are not about pleasing one party entirely at the expense of another. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, enough said by me.  I don't plan to belabor this non-debate.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>another guest</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2004, 16:59</p><p>Are you afraid of opinions that are different from your own, guest?  I find the debate interesting myself because we all have our quirks.  How many of people here like to see women playing with their own glasses.  Isn't this forum all about how we like and want women to do what we want, and I mean wear glasses.  I have seen many posts discouraging lasik only because the significant other wants to continue to see his partner in glasses.  Is that any less selfish than curious?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2004, 16:09</p><p>I think Curious is Sheila's man.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2004, 16:06</p><p>I think Curious is just trying to get a rise...  perhaps if he is ignored, he will go away.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curious</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2004, 15:35</p><p>Shelia, you don't seem to understand my point.  Your partner obviously gets an exhilirated thrill from seeing you dependant upon him so much to be your second eyes.  I can understand that feeling, but you cannot.  If you listen to your man, as you should, you both can develop a healthy sexual lifestyle, otherwise you will be the only enjoying anything.  Why does it seem that this relationship is all about pleasing you when he has indicated his desires that you refuse to meet?  You are being improper.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2004, 14:02</p><p>Sheila, why not male a deal with your boyfriend. Tell him that you will go out for the evening without wearing youe glasses if provided that he will wear your glasses for the evening (and no cheating by looking over the tops of the frame. I just hope for his sake that you have unisex style frames. Then see how he likes it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2004, 13:41</p><p>Guest. I'm not that blind that I can't see something 12 inches away from my face. If I had to concentrate on it for some time, thats when its impossible.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ree</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2004, 10:24</p><p> Sheila </p><p>   If your partner is trying to be a perfectionist and wants a perfect partner for himself,, then he is  simply wasting his time,  As there  is nothing like perfection here.  And i should say that you have every right to feel annoyed when asked to be without your glasses.  Its good you have decided to put your foot down. </p><p>   Sheila you are right,, that you did not find any distortions,,, by distortions I mean a sort of magnification  coupled with reflections,, . I have seen them in my aunts Glasses who is aphakic ,post cataract surgery,  but her Rx is way beyond yours,, around + 10 and more. </p><p>    In India here ,, as general trend people tend to associate Thick Plus glasses with old age and also post cataract surgery,,, but now a days IOL anr coming in a big way </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2004, 07:02</p><p>I assume the last post to Ree was from Sheila - if so, Sheila can I ask how you managed to see your colleagues eyes when she tried your new glasses on if you are so longsighted without your glasses??</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2004, 06:12</p><p>Ree </p><p>It would seem everyone disagrees with Curious. As mentioned, there is a limit what you do for someone. . I think my partner takes my bad eyesight as a weakness on my part. This is silly, its not my fault that I have bad eyes, and would love to have perfect eyesight, but thats never going to happen, he should know that. In his mind, my eyesight is an imperfection, and should not be there. All I really want him to understand, is that I rely on my glasses, and there is no way I can go without them for long. This is why I get annoyed when he asks me to go out without them.  </p><p>    Not sure if it would make any difference if my prescription was minus. Have a friend like that, and her glasses appear to be all rings when looking sideways at her. Wasnt aware that my eyes might look distorted behind by lenses, asked a friend at work today if this was the case. She said they did not appear that way. Then asked her to put my glasses on for a few minutes and let me see how her eyes looked. Apart from the magnification (Which looked a lot to me in this new script) and slight glare as she turned her head, thought looked ok.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>still</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2004, 17:53</p><p>Shelia, I agree with you. Hang tough! Mal, you said it right! Curious, I'm curious: where did you find those ideas? And when?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mal`</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2004, 17:08</p><p>Curious I think you are taking the p***s. Are you trying to inflame some sort of gender debate? as a guy I find your attitude outdated and insular. Do you live in a part of the world that hasn't yet embraced the principles of diversity?  Women are our equals not our servants, they're not submissive to us.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curious</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2004, 16:57</p><p>I understand where you are coming from Shelia, however, if you ignore your man's desires it won't be long before he is your ex.  You are too strong willed.  I think that is the problem with some women today, they need to remember they are the rib and not the body.  They are here as a help-meet for the Man.  You should do your best in that regard to please him if you truly desire to keep him.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ree</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2004, 06:40</p><p>  Sheila,  thats a wonderful attitude you have.  It is very true That you are as old as you feel,, thats it. </p><p>   I disagree with Curious,  yes its true to a certain that every lady tries to please her man,,may be by wearing what he likes,, or cooking what pleases him.  And Vice versa.  But there is a limit to that.  I can very well understand that if you had a mild Rx and he occassionallly requested you to go out with him without glasses,, It was ok.  But now You have a serious Rx,, and by what you describe your vision without glasses,, you seem to be pretty much blind without them,  So to be without your glasses for any lenght of time must be real torture for you,  and he has to understand that.  Till now you went along with his wishes ,  but now as you are getting on with age and your vision worsening ,  hw should understand that you  absolutely need glasses to see,  after all ageing is a natural process which everyone has to face and slowly the body starts giving way.  Just like we get grey hair and wrinkles with age,  so thick glasses are also one of them,, and should be taken like that,  and accepted.  He should also realize that even he with time will need glasses at least for reading.  So Its no big deal. </p><p>    And you I feel once you get Hi index glasses in a small size in quite stylish frames  where the lenses dont appear too Bulbous,  eventually he should have no problems accepting you in them. </p><p>    One thing which  I would like to add,  though you may not agree with it,  is that ,  Maybe he gets all the more bugged up that you have to wear strong Plus glasses,  which magnify the eyes and tend to distort to a certain degree,  which is not that obvious with minus lenses.  So maybe Hypothetically if you had minus glasses in an even stronger Rx,, he would have not  objected to them.  Anyway One thing is clear,, you have compromised enough,  and now its his turn to see sense and adjust.  take care. </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest 1</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2004, 05:27</p><p>Shelia, wonderful, but say calm and confident don,t allow your anger to take over. I detest any form of control in a relationship and thats what your partner is trying to do. Shelia from your post its been hard enough for you to come to terms with the high differece in your lenses he should be praising you, secondly you know you need to wear your glasses both from a health point of view, and safety, don,t allow anyone to tell you whats good for you, you know best and stick with it. keep your determination and confidence up Shelia we are behind you all the way.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2004, 04:24</p><p>Curious. As an afterthought before I go to work, In my early 20's before I even knew that I would need glasses in the close future, I went out with a man who wore them. I can remember him saying that he really needed them. That was fine, would never have thought of asking him not to wear them, that would have been an insult to him. I knew he wore glasses when I went out with him, the same as my partner did with me. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2004, 04:02</p><p>Curious. It does upset me. Pleasing my partner is fine, but how far do you go. You dont know how much I suffer to spend any length of time without my glasses. If we go out for the evening, I spend half the time peering around me. Peoples faces are blurred, I cant see any thing clear in the distance, and develop really bad headaches without them. If you needed glasses that were as strong as mine, you would fully understand how it feels. I feel naked without them, and it just ruins the time out. </p><p> </p><p>Still, So glad that you agree with me. Why should I suffer this indignity. It makes me feel embarrassed when I cant see things clearly.  </p><p> </p><p>Ree.  Hallo again,  My partner hasnt seen them yet, he is away on business for a couple of weeks. I really do not know what bugs him, and do not think the fact that I have to wear strong glasses should make any difference. I may be 45, but am still very slim, dress smartly, and (so am told) are attractive. I have asked him why he doesnt like me in glasses, but get no sensible answer. All he can say, is that I have lovely big blue eyes, and behind the magnification of my lenses, they look too big. He has commented that other people who wear glasses, do not seem to have such magnified eyes as myself.  Maybe they dont need glasses to the same script as mine, or some other reason. At the end of the day, I need them, will wear them, and he can go to hell if he does not like it.  Feel better getting that of my chest.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>still</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2004, 21:27</p><p>Curious, why do you say that it should be about pleasing the man? In a real relationship, why should one person, Shelia, have to subject herself to the discomfort or even danger of visual difficulty for a part of the time in the relationship? And why should her friend/partner, who we assume loves and respects her, expect or allow her to suffer this indignity? Should he not be respectful of her need in this? What are _his_ obligations? I say this as a man who loves women who wear glasses, true, but also as a man who loves and respects people, and does not wish for those he loves to suffer, just to please him.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curious</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2004, 16:23</p><p>Personally, I know this might make you upset Shelia, but I think you should compromise and be willing to go some of the time without glasses.  It should be about pleasing the man, not yourself, shouldn't it?  If he finds that attractive, meet him at least halfway.</p><p></p><hr>

Bt the way did he see you in them//? </p><p>  YOu mentioned that you are older than your partner,, is this the fact that bugs him,  maybe or does he feel that you look much  older with your strong plus glasses??  Did he tell you the actual reason for his aversion or did you try to find out...? </p><p>     Or the last thing which seems pretty silly is that,, " Is he just ashamed to go out with you in glasses'? </p><p>   If he makes any negative comment then I feel its better that you confront him ask him plainly as to why he dosent want you in glasses.....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest 1</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2004, 09:48</p><p>Shelia thats wonderful you have made a posiitve stand, remember old saying (what goes round comes round), so you partner will one day experience the need for glasses and only then will he appreciate how badly you compromised to please him until now. I,m sure there plenty of nice comments from your friends about your glasses which must boast your confidence, and i,m sure since you are wearing your glasses fultime now your much happier in yourself. I think its time your partner stopped looking through rose coloured glasses and accepted it for his benefit also you wear your glasses because happy lady keeps her man happy. I would welcome you to fall into my arms any day </p><p>I would never allow you not to be seen out socially wearing your glasses. I,m so pleased for you Shelia it was so bold of you to stand up for your own interests.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2004, 08:51</p><p>Curious. I'm not nearsighted, but longsighted (extremely). Partner is only a bit younger than me, and I can't wait until he requires glasses for reading or more, that will be a different thing. As I have said to all the kind people who offered advice, going bare eyed is a thing of the past. If he wants me to go out without them, he can go on his own, or find a new girlfriend. Enought of my moaning, can report the glasses are really working fine. Finding no problems at work, it is coming natural to look out of correct lens, depending whether am looking at something close or distant. </p><p>(Killer heels will be back soon) No one has really noticed or commented on the extra magnification in my right eye. If things ok after a month or so, will order high index. Have heard there can be quite a reflection from them, is this true. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curious</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2004, 10:48</p><p>Shelia, I'm just wondering if your boyfriend is using the story of disliking your glasses as a coverup for the fact that he gets turned on by having you go around bare-eyed and nearsighted with you clinging to him.  As long as both parties are consenting, this activity can definitely be stimulating and erotic for both individuals.  Perhaps this is why he doesn't want you to wear glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest 1</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2004, 16:23</p><p>Shelia I wonder when you first meet your partner did you not wear your glasses to please him, after all when we think we have meet or dream partner we will do anything to please him or her. Shelia I suspect you needed to wear your glasses all the time 5 years ago but because of your partners hang up about glasses and not wanting to displease him you gave into his wishes.I think it was shallow of him to ask you to do without your glasses on dates with him, I have always thought love the lady love her glasses.From a mans prespective your partner did not think you attractive enough in glasses which would leave me to doubt his total love for you, we all have negatives in our make up and glasses are the least of those. Shelia at least you have learnt a lesson start the way you mean to finish it will save you from discomfort in the long run. I,m so pleased your now wearing your glasses all the time, its so obvious you need too, and I,m also please your putting yourself first for a change. Good specs wearing and we love you for your boldness in a tricky situation.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2004, 13:36</p><p>Very Unequal Mam. </p><p>Wish I had tried out this years ago, all that time spend swapping between reading and distant glasses. If you feel ready, go for it</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2004, 13:34</p><p>BB, Thank you for your very kind remarks. My partner has always had a hang up about my glasses. He just does not like me in them. The point that makes me mad, when he met me five years ago, he new that I had bad eyesight and needed to wear glasses fulltime.At that time  I could leave them off now and again if going out anywhere special, but those days are gone. There is just no way I can go without them. </p><p>Getting back to what I was originally going to post, Ive worn them all day, and no problems. Watching tv or reading, so far so good. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Very Unequal Mam</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2004, 09:16</p><p>Good luck Shelia, I am glad you are getting along well. </p><p> </p><p>You are making me think I should go that route, sooner rather than later :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BB</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2004, 08:52</p><p>Dear Shelia, great to hear your more then pleased with your new glasses, and the more you wear them the more you will find you need to wear them all the time, so if your partner had an option before whither you put your glasses on or not thats gone now, as you will walk around not only endangering yourself but others, Shelia I fail to understand your partners aversion to your glasses, todays lenses and frames are made very much to enhance the wearer, and the days of little choice in glasses, the big thick bulging lenses are long gone.Shelia no lady likes to have a large increase in their rx, and its hard enough for a lady to accept her thickish glasses without her partner making her feel she is not attractive, I think the attitude of your partner is bordering on mental cruelty, maybe thats a little strong, for a change would,nt it be nice if your partner past a genuine compliment about your glasses how this would do your confidence a world of good.Be strong Shelia wear your glasses, if your partner can,t accept your glasses tell him to get lost, we here in the post room are with you and I,m sure your a lovely looking lady, because your personality shines through in your posts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2004, 07:19</p><p>Ree,BB,Guest,Alan and any others who posted and gave their opinions. I don@t work Mondays, so when I received a phonecall this morning, informing me that my new glasses were ready,it seemed a good chance to give them a go. </p><p>I've had them on for about 5 hours now, and apart from remembering which eye to use for what, think that I will manage fine. There are a few minor points. The magnification of my right eye, is quite a lot more than my left, but with a +7.50 and +3.75 that is to be expected, but the thickness does not seem to servere. I met a friend for lunch, she knew nothing about my new perscription. When we sat down and I picked up the menu and decided what to have, the first question was "Sheila why arnt you changing your glasses to read, you always do. I explained what I had done, and I was happy when she replied, you would never notice. The next point, when I go for high index lenses, will choose smaller a frame. My spare pair are rather larger, and the lenses appear to be slightly bulbous. Other thing to watch out for, was that I nearly fell off the pavement when crossing the road, must have looked down through wrong lenses. (Did not help that I had on my usual "Killer Heels" - think they will be left in the back of the wardrobe for a while. Another point (For us girls) will have to watch the eye make up, use less on the right eye, due to increased magnification. On the whole, things appear to be going quite well. After a few days, will get in the habit of using the correct eye. No sign of any headache or eyestrain as yet. My partner will not like the extra strenght I now wear, but thats tough </p><p>Will post again in a few days and endevour to answer any questions. Thanks again to all of you. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2004, 13:56</p><p>Thanks Ree.You don't know how happy I am at getting what I want at last. if it does not work, at least I have tried. Agree my reading script rather on the strong side, optician remarked on that, but said not a point to worry about. As for my partner, he will never like me in glasses, but I am going to refuse to leave them off anymore. I need them, not him.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ree</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2004, 12:11</p><p>  Sheila,  happy that you got an optician who could understand your needs and address your problems.  It very often happens that many people in the medical field ,, just dont pay much attention to patients problem which may seem trivial or silly to them,  but are really bothersome ones for the patients.   </p><p>     I dont find anything unusual about your new script,, except for maybe  a rather strong reading add.  I am still not sure how you will react to having monovision lenses in each eye for near and far correction,  but i hope you come to a solution which satisfies your needs. </p><p>   I was really surprised at your partner for asking you to take off your glasses when you go out,  knowing pretty well that you cannot manage without them,, must say looks pretty silly to me.  Anyway hope that he accepts you in your glasses.  And all the best with the new Glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2004, 11:31</p><p>Alan BB Ree, Guest and anyone else who was interested. Found the multi chain optician so helpful. Need a slight change in perscription but nothing drastic. New RX now R+4.50 add 3.00 L+3.75 add 2.50. Still going to have reading script in my right eye, but he suggested for the small difference in cost, have both lenses made up, then if not happy, can try reading script in the other eye. This to me sounded quite reasonable. If after trying this and it works out, optician suggests I come back and invest in high index lenses. This would keep the thicknes down and if I choose a smaller frame, would not make the magnification to great. At last some possitive thoughts. People just do not understand the problems that I had in progressive and bifocals. It really gets to me, that my regular option was so negative. Hope to pick up glasses Saturday or early next week. Will try them for a while then post results. Again thanks for all the positive help</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2004, 16:55</p><p>Shelia,what a wonderful story,itsnice a multi national was so helpful, then again I suppose knowing your prescription and the hassel you have had with glasses they know you could be good customer for years, so it was a good day for the two parties. Shelia I think its time your partner acceted your need to wear glasses fultime, he fell in love with Shelia, he knew you needed to wear glasses, why the big issue with him now?, it must knock your confidence to be asked not to wear your glasses, also its undermining your choice to wear your glasses. Shelia take the bull by the horns whither he likes it or not you will wear your glasses and he will eventually accept its no big deal you wearing your glasses. You have had your own little insecurities to deal without them being added too. We in the post room are with you all the way. takecare and good luck Shelia </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2004, 13:54</p><p>I've seen about 3 + and - combinations in the last 10 years, as far as I can remember.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>June</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2004, 11:30</p><p>Hi Del, Don't think that uncommon to have a minus and plus perscription. My optician said he has come across this quite a few time in his career. My present perscription is L+7.00 R-3.00. </p><p>Only found out needed glasses when my mum said why do you often close your right eye when looking at something in the distance. To reply to Sheila who was worried about the magnification of her lenses, My left eye is magnified to a quite large extent, and my right eye looks smaller. (Trying to balance my eyemake up is a nightmare)Cannot remember exactly, but think first perscription was in region of L+2.50 R_1.25 then changed quite often. Now aged 19 and due another examination and no doubt change shortly. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2004, 08:14</p><p>Sorry, meant reading script in my right eye.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2004, 08:12</p><p>Alan, BB and all the other people who offered me advice. I spoke to my normal optician on Friday about making an appointment for an eye examination. Told her what I wanted to try, and did not receive any really useful advise. Her opinion is that I should wear progressive or bifocal and just try to get used to them , if not use two pairs of glasses like I do now. During my lunch hour today, I went into one of the multi chain opticians and received very very helpful advise. The optician discussed the problems that I suffered with progressive and bifocals. The end result is that I am going for an eye examination tomorrow at 3pm. He has told me to bring my spare glasses with me, and he will put reading script in one lens and distance in the other. We discussed which way around to have the lenses. On reflection, my Left eye has the best overall vision, so am going to leave that one for distance and have reading script in my left eye. Though the magnification will be different, it will not appear to obvious. They can be ground to appear to be similar thickness. So thats what I am going to settle for. There is nothing to to be lost (Except paying for a new set of lenses in my spare glasses). He did caution that for driving, this would not be a good thing, but since I do not drive, thats no problem. Was impressed by the service in the multi chain opticians. Have used a small local one all of the time since first needing glasses, but don't think will be going back there. (Before someone gets a dig at me, I'm sure there are good and bad in all) If this does not solve my problem, at least I can use two seperate pairs of glasses, knowing that I did try other options. The contact lenses path was tried many years ago, but my eyes are unsuitable to wear them (Much to my partners disgust who really hates me in glasses and ofter asks me to leave them in my bag when going out. He does not seem to understand that when my perscription was weaker, I could manage this now and again, but those days have long gone. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2004, 06:51</p><p>Sheila -- One clarification to my earlier reply: Sorry I was confusing about which eye needed the reading prescription.  I just meant that the "reading" eye and the "distance" eye could (probably) be chosen to help balance the strength of your glasses lenses.  So (assuming you see reasonably well out of each eye, generally, with your glasses), I don't think you'd have to have one glasses lens a lot stronger than the other. </p><p> </p><p>About the depth perception comment someone made:  it's true that with this "monovision" strategy where one eye is corrected for reading, your depth perception may not be as good.  But it won't "all go away"...your depth perception should still be pretty good (just not good enough for, say, competitive sports).  You'll have to try it and see what you think, though; it works for some people and not others.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fran.</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2004, 01:53</p><p>Derek. Thank you for saying I am to young for reading glasses, Comments like that I like. You asked what made me think that I needed glasses in the first place. I had noticed my headaches lately were increasing, more so when reading and watching tv. I sat watching a late night film one evening, my mother who was staying with me for a short time had retired for the night. She had left her reading glasses on the table beside her chair. I picked them up just to see what they were like and had the shock of my life. The clarity at close objects and objects about 10 to 15 ft away was unbelievable. Far distance was about the same. In the morning, I mentioned this to my mother, who was horrified, my glasses are quite strong she said, and only for very close work, If you can see distance in them your eyes must need glasses. The rest is history, within a week I became a glasses wearer, going full time with a couple of weeks. My eyesight changed quite rapidly, first change after only a year where my left eye was increased to +3.50 and Right eye to +2.50.Then steady changes up to my present perscription.Friends who try my glasses on reckon they are strong but to me they seem just fine.  Think the optician said I was probably always longsighted but my eyes managed to cope. Certainly never had any trouble at school and passed all the eye exams.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Del</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2004, 23:03</p><p>June. Whats your perscription. Don't often hear of + and - together. </p><p>Did this begin suddenly or gradually over period of years.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>4eyes</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2004, 07:14</p><p>Hi, Nancy... </p><p> </p><p>I got and old prescription, dated Oct-03-2003, that I gave up, because I barely got used to them. My dad ordered the glasses and forced me to use them. My eyes went very funny and I got horrible headache and dizzy and nauseas by the end of the day. I just couldn´t wear them so they didn´t last more than  3 months before I "lost" them. I think I still have one of those. </p><p> </p><p>The prescription read +23, 25 OD and +24, 00 OE; at top, and the bottom lenses reads +27, 50 OD and +27, 75 OE with 14 prisms final.

<p><b>Ree</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2004, 03:24</p><p>  Sheila,  read your posts and found them to be quite interesting. First thind is hat i found  it quite surprising that inspite of starting needing glasses pretty late at 25,, your eyesight deteriorated quite rapidly over the years.  Did your ophthalmologist attribute any reason to it? </p><p>  I must say i did nt find this problem of yours of not being able to adjust to bifocals and progressives surprising,  as i have known some people who are really close to me experience the same problems when they were prscribed bifocals.  One even tripped and fell down,, because she was not able to see as she was looking down through the reading add while walking.  But they gradually after a period of time got adjusted to bifocals ,, some by ajusting the diatavce of their glases on their nose and others by tilting thie back or at other angles in order to see.   I am interested to know as what was the exact problem that you are facing with bifocals,  and how long have you given bifocals a try?  In fact did you get bifocal glasses in your Rx.   </p><p>  regarding this idea of using one eye for distance and another for reading works ok in some,, but i would not advise it.  You see we have two eyes as we need them both for binocular Visin,, which is very essential,, for depth perception and thus  3 dimensional vision.  By using only eye for distance correction you are going to loose all that.  did you ever try wearing contacts for distance correction,, and having separate reading glasses,, which seems a more practical option.  And if you feel you need an update in ur Rx then get it done at the earliest.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>June</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2004, 23:23</p><p>Sheila. Don't worry about the magnification of your lenses. As you were told, be positivel. I was very much like you a few years ago. I am short sighted in one eye and very long sighted in the other. The magnification in my left eye compared to the other shorted sighted eye is very considerable. Im 19 and been wearing glasses for 5 years.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2004, 18:26</p><p>Visitor, I first had to get glasses at age 8 and now, at almost 56 I am at about -3.  It's very moderate myopia but I wear my glasses fulltime.   Until I found this board I did not realise how unusual my situation is.  Many people who first need glasses for myopia in their teens end up more nearsighted than I am.  Often people who get their first glasses at 8 end up with a Rx over -10 which is pretty high.  So age of onset is not a reliable indicator of the final Rx when it finally stabilises.  Sorry I can't help you more than that </p><p>Why not just say in a friendly way that you find the need for glasses/contacts fascinating and ask him what his Rx is?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Visitor</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2004, 17:34</p><p>I recently met a man who first got glasses at age 8.  Based on this does anybody have a guess as to what his prescription could be?  So far I have only seen him in his contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fran</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2004, 14:14</p><p>Derek, </p><p>You may be correct. Will know next week have eye test scheduled for Tues morning. Will have to dig out old perscriptions to answer all your questions.Thought at age 37 my eyes would have settled down. Anyone know at what age longsight slows up or does it keep going. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BB Shelia</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2004, 06:36</p><p>its nice to get a reply to posts thats what its about,being friendly and giving encouragement when needed, Shelia your making your reading glasses an issue with yourself, those images of how big your eyes may look will be in total contrast to how you are percieved.I,m sure you have seem many times maybe at work, out socialising, or travelling glasses worn by strangers who noticeable differences in their lenses, I,m sure you just accept it as part of using glasses to see better, at the ned of the day glasses is a health issue whats more important your health or your shyness about your reading glasses. Shelia we all build up fears in new situations that never materialise, having reading glasses for the first time is worries within yourself, be bold and proud of your glasses and don,t allow hang ups to constantly nag at you. take care and good luck.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Derek</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2004, 03:36</p><p>Fran, Have you thought, you may not need stronger glasses for close work, your existing prescription may need to be increased. You seem to have jumped to a quite high perscription from your original one ten years ago. What made you realease that you needed glasses? </p><p>Your first perscription was stronger than most people begin with. Did you wear them full time straight away or gradually get to that? How many increases have you had since your first pair? Would have have thought you are a bit young for seperate reading glasses, but I am no expert. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2004, 01:00</p><p>BB, Thanks for your helpful reply. You could be right in what you say. And , yes I can remember the first pair of glassed I had.Would only wear them if no one was in the office, but quite happy to wear them at home when alone. My optician said i was long sighted and whilst this was a mild perscription, it could remain mild or increase rapidly. It seems to me, that I have always had this hang up about the magnification of my lenses. To begin with, it was not to much of a problem, but with every increase in perscription it bothered me more.It does not help by being blond and having very big blue eyes (Bimbo comes to mind) I even tried to keep the lenses weaker by telling the optician that the letters on the board were clear,when in fact some of them were quite blurred. But I will be possitive as you say BB, What does it matter if one of my lenses is +6.50 (possibly even more) I Can't imagine the joy of only having to use one pair of glasses to see all clearly. (you people who can wear progressive or bifocls do not know how lucky you are.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BB</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2004, 17:31</p><p>Shelia, I think your over worrying about your need for reading glasses, if your negative about the image to others they portray you will allow yourself to almost hide away wearing reading glasses. Experiments have been done to prove if we take a negative attitude to what we consider not so attractive we draw attention to what we are trying to avoid. Taking a positive attutude to your reading glasses you will find and be pleasantly surprised no one will notice or comment on the difference in your lenses, Shelia can you remember the first pair of glasses you ever had to wear, I,m sure you were shy did not want people to see you in glasses, looked in the mirror and imagined your eyes were large and probably felt people would make fun of you. Then you plucked up courage put your glasses on and the comment about them were complimentary and soon people took no notice of your glasses, they were interested in you, it will be the same with your reading glasses, you will be the same Shelia, after acouple of days it will be like having breakfast each day wearing your reading glasses. Take care Shelia and good luck, look forward to hearing how you get on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sheila</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2004, 03:13</p><p>Julian. Sure will let you know outcome. Hope to get appointment next week. And it is Sheila, See what I mean about my close sight, cannot even see the keyboard right and cannot touch type.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2004, 02:04</p><p>Shelia (or is it Sheila?): I'll be interested to hear what comes of your enquiry. Someone I know was told that would work with contacts but not with specs - but your eye doc may have other ideas. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Shelia</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2004, 01:51</p><p>Alan. Thanks for the reply. It certainly seems worth a try and using reading and distance lenses in the same frame. I would give anything not to have to keep changing glasses, its a pain to say the least. The only slight worry,is that you suggest the reading script goes into my weaker eye. That will make my right eye +6.50 and Left +3.50. Thats quite a large difference in magnification, and Im worried that my right eye will look huge compared to my left. Added with the fact that I'm preety sure my perscription needs changing, it could be worse than this. Even so, I could live with that rather than keep changing glasses. </p><p>I will make an appointment and discuss this with my optician. Will post any result. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2004, 11:09</p><p>Sheila - you could have the distance prescription in one lens and the reading prescription in the other.  The glasses wouldn't look weird as long as you put the reading script in the eye that has the stronger prescription.  This is done with LASIK patients and contact lens wearers all the time; it's done to allow the person to not wear glasses. </p><p> </p><p>My guess is that you wouldn't tolerate this well.  Some people have trouble with it (because one eye is clear and the other is blurry; the mind has to figure out how to ignore the blurry one).  Your difficulty with bifocals might mean your eyes/mind have trouble adjusting to "abnormal" visual inputs (everyone is different in this regard).  BUT it's possible that you could deal with this even though you can't tolerate bifocals.  It's worth a try; ask your eye doctor about it...he or she should be able to let you try it with a trial lens set at their office.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fran</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2004, 07:44</p><p>Hi Sheila, </p><p>Interesting what you say ref progresive and bifocals. I'm very similar to yourself, aged 37 and current perscription R+4.50  +L+6.25 Cyl +050 both eyes. Am having difficulty reading small print or trying to focus on close objects. A girl I work with has a very similar perscription to mine but with a +Add for close work. She wears progressive, and having tried them on, there is no way I could wear them. It was like looking through a moving river whenever I Turned my head. I Have not tried a bifocal, but if it is anything like the progressive, You and I are going to have the same problems. Interesting thought your friend had, one reading lens and one distant lens. </p><p>I have never heard of this. I have worn glasses for about ten years, starting of quite mild at R+2.00 L+2.50 but eyes rapidly changed in mid 30's. Found this site quite by chance. It seems a great place to chat with other people about our glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>shelia</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2004, 11:03</p><p>Georgina </p><p>Just cannot get used to bifocals or progresives. Tried every way,never seem to be looking through the right part. The progresive were the most trouble, i just could not wear them for more than a few hours. Spoke to many friends about this and they can't see my problems as i do. It has got to the the stage now , (So my partner says) that i seem to wear my reading glasses more than my distant. This is true, with the reading i can see tv and most things i need to, and only need to change to see objects quite far away. (Had this perscription 17 months)That why i wondered if it was possible to wear reading and distance in the same pair of glasses. My Partner does not like me in glasses </p><p>and would rather i didn't wear them, but as i tell him this is not an option. Thanks for replying Georgina</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sheila</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2004, 07:56</p><p>My problem is that however hard i have tried and believe me, ive tried hard for years to wear bifocals and progresive glasses, but cannot get used to them. </p><p>first prescribed glasses at 24 years of age due to headaches at work. Prescription if i remember correct was R+1.25 L+1.25 . My eyes remained fairly steady for many years. On reaching 35, i was prescibed an add of R+1.50 L+1.00  I was happy at this stage to use two sets of glasses. But the last few years has seen a huge increase in my distance correction. i am nearly 45 now and  the perscription has changed to R+4.00 Add 2.50 L+3.50 Add 2.00 Thats if i have read the perscription correct. As i said there is no way i can wear progressive or bifocals, and its not for the want of trying. Discussing this with a friend at work, she suggested that i have my reading perscription in on eye and the distance in the other.Any of you guys with all this knowledge know if this would work. and would it look odd, bearing in mind that one of the lenses would be thicker than the other. Anyone out there heard of this before. Hope to hear from you soon, </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>fracl 21 (Paris)</b>&nbsp;26 May 2004, 18:28</p><p>4 eyes, </p><p> </p><p>I read your post in more detail now (you're from Brazil) and was thinking about you problems to access guyglasses5. I don't think that you need another dialer, or at least it would be very strange. Your problems should not be related to the way you go on the internet. If you use your account where you entered your age correctly than it is normal that you don't get access. You should get access by creating another account and entering an older date of birth. But your dad might have installed some kind of cild protection program, than it gets tricky and I recommend an internet café because the new ones are not imposible to overcome but you would need a good computer expierience. If you want I can give you my login and password that worked fin for 5 years now on every computer I've been on, you try it out (you don't post bullshit) and if it works than I can create you an similar account and it will work as well, I then change my password and everything is in order again. (fraclglasses@noos.fr) </p><p> </p><p>By the way, I hope you are not shocked because I wrote 'Enjoy your glasses' and 'Enjoy your view' in the last post. In your case you would probably prefere having better eyes and I can understand if it sounded stupid, I'm sorry it's a bad habit, from guysglasses and other groups on Eye Scene. What I mean by saying that is more like 'make the best out of it and don't let yourself down just because your eyes are not perfect'. I hope you can accept that. But in my view thats a perfect example to tell you what eye scene and guyglasses are about:  </p><p> </p><p>1.talk about glasses and vision with people that like to talk about them (hard to find in the world out there) </p><p> </p><p>2.Beeing able to express things like 'I like my glasses', 'I want stronger glasses', 'I like girls in glasses' etc. and discuss about it without people beeing to shocked and think you are crazy. </p><p> </p><p>3.And finaly beeing able to take your sitution not to seriously during the 5 minutes you are on the page. That can be a situation like yours, the one of people that want stronger glasses or people that suffer because they can't express their sexual attraction towards people in glasses in the real word, get help and find friends that think or feel the same. </p><p> </p><p>Welcome to EyeScene.</p><p></p><hr>

Just create a new account and enter another age, there is nothing on that site that someone of 15 should not see, it was only created as adulte group because we had problems with some pictures of a naked guy ages ago. </p><p> </p><p>If you still have lots of problems, send me an E-Mail on fraclglasses@noos.fr and I make you an account on an invented name and I send you the log in and password.

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;19 May 2004, 17:31</p><p>TJ,   At your age the only hope for a stronger minus Rx is force your eyes to read without the add in your Rx. You Could perhaps get your Rx for distance only, and have a prism incorporated, to stop your eyes from going crossed. this would also result in thicker lenses.You could try doing alot of close work with your distance Rx for a week or two, and definatly several hours prior to an eye exam.The resulting strain may get you the prism  Rx.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;19 May 2004, 05:26</p><p>TJ, see if you can find Daffy's posts on various threads. This was his problem too, so he took it into his own hands. There's always on-line ordering! ^up there^</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>TJ</b>&nbsp;17 May 2004, 15:08</p><p>Sorry but forgot to add this question I have.  When I am getting fitted with correction and the doctor says which line can I read to,which one is better number 1 or 2, why is it better in the machine he has than in the real glasses I wear.  When I asked him about it he said because I pick correction that will be a certain strength but he decides to cut it back for me.  On two occasions I have returned to say that my eyes are not clear with glasses and he will put the clicks in the machine and say THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE WEARING IN YOUR GLASSES, but it is not.  His machine is what I would like and is clear but my glasses do not let me see like that.  I tell him so, we do clicks and it turns out the same all the time.  What do I tell him so I can get the better glasses?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>TJ</b>&nbsp;17 May 2004, 15:02</p><p>I have astigmatism -2.5, and myopia -.75.  I also have add 2.5 in my glasses. I wear them always but really would like for them to be thicker.  Can I do anything to need stronger ones?  I am 35.  I have read to wear myopic glasses when reading but hard as I try cannot see to read without crossing eyes with myopic glasses on.  I have bifocals in flat tops.  My adds keep going up but glasses are not thick enough for my tastes. I want my myopia glasses to make my eyes very small and for the lenses to be thick.  Can you suggest things for me to try.  I will have an appointment in a couple weeks.  I thank you.</p><p></p><hr>

Although my lenses may not be has strong as others. I have great difficulty managing without them and if that is not bad enough I was diagnosed with cronic open-angle glaucoma at the age of 24 and has been finding it even more difficult to cope.  My optic nerves have been badly damage and continues to deteriorate. I now have lost more than 50% of my spherical vision. I cannot drive at nights I have difficulties driving in the days as I drove through a pedes.crossing twice during the day with pedes on it. Recently I have been experiencing frequent flashes of light and straight lines are appearing distorted. I suffer from constant eyestrain as my eyes never seem to adjust totally to these lenses. People never look at me, they always look through me because they think I cannot see them. My daughter teases me all the time because she thinks I am blind. Whenever I take off my glasses she says my eyes looks like a duppy. why is it that persons who are nearsighted has eyes that looks abnormal without glasses. Is Flashing lights and wavy lines associated glaucoma?  </p><p>Looking forward to some answers. </p><p> </p><p>Ming. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2004, 10:42</p><p>Tod: However, inadvertantly it was genius on your your part. Think about it, "making yourelf hyperopic" (temporarily, by wearing minus lenses that are stronger than you need) is not a million miles from the "too much close work" theory. Bear with me here, I'm musing. If both these activities force you to use your "near accomodation" (I think that's what you said), maybe that is part of what's going on. That's an unfinished train of thought, but there it is.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2004, 08:54</p><p>Tonya, When I said having on minus glasses "makes" you farsighted, I was infering that it gives you the effect of being such. I did not mean it will cause you to become such!!!!! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2004, 08:30</p><p>Here's another thought. I've studied yoga for 25 years. I practice daily, no matter now busy I am. I can sit in several positions that a woman my age should not even be able to achieve, let alone stay in. If someone new to yoga tried some of these she'd hurt herself. No question about it. You can't expect a muscle to adapt like that overnight. But when it has been trained during 9125 daily sessions, it's easy. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2004, 08:01</p><p>It is also pretty widely accepted that undercorrection can slow the rate of myopia increase.  I do not buy the idea that wide acceptance is a substitute for empirical evidence (witness the popularity, in the total absence of repeatable data, of the various organized superstitions that enjoy great popularity even in modern societies).  However, I certainly think that it's reasonable to expect that there will be some developmental effect on ANY body part depending on how it's used.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2004, 03:49</p><p>Tanya: If you go barefoot for enough years however your feet will get wider due to lack of support.  </p><p> </p><p>All I can tell you is that there are plenty of testimonials of people who HAVE achieved higher myopia deliberately (or not so deliberately sometimes). The two points that would seem pertinant to your experience are that they tend to be very young, and that they don't wear the glasses for "long periods" but permanently. I don't think anyone has ever suggested it would work for anyone, and from what you have said, if you are naturally hyperopic then it's quite obvious why it didn't work for you, AND why it gave you headaches. I can well imagine. Ouch! </p><p> </p><p>We mentioned orthodontics recently. Perhaps overcorrection with minus lenses works like braces, a bit of persuasion, a bit more, a bit more, a bit more. It's not "just" a piece of glass, it's a lens. They're powerful things. I believe those who've told me of their experiences, after all, they were there.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Daffy</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2004, 21:49</p><p>Oh...and your analogy of small feet in big shoes is correct, but put smaller shoes on larger feet...no, your feet don't shrink, they will warp somewhat until they do fit...permanantly! They may be somewhat deformed (toes bending in all directions etc.) but it will go into smaller shoes. That is what is happeneing to some of us here with out sight.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Daffy</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2004, 21:45</p><p>Tanya...sorry to burst your bubble, but I think you are wrong. You may be correct to a point in that it won't happen to everyone (including yourself). But to generalise (anything for that matter) is fairly dangerous (so to speak). </p><p> </p><p>I personally feel I increased my Rx (no one in my family, past or present, have an Rx greater than -2) by about -3. I learnt to fudge Rx's only because they (The eye doctors) always said they will 'under-correct' me, despite me telling them I want the best possible vision. I always increased the Rx by -0.5 to get that extra crispyness. I didn't do it intentionally to get a higher Rx, I just wanted to get crisp vision. I also toyed with the idea of prism in my lenses...guess what, now they are prescribed and I can't see without them. I'm currently at -5.25 (with all the other extras like 0.75 astig, 4D prism In). </p><p> </p><p>In my case..somewhat reluctantly...I've reached way more Rx by using plastic in front of my eyes. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod What Electra and the Rest</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2004, 15:56</p><p>Here we go again! </p><p>Whether this is posted here or any other thread, the message is the same, I cannot see how looking through a piece of glass is going to change how our eyes or any other part of our bodies develope  Wearing minus glasses that are too strong has about as much chance of making you myopic,as wearing shoes that are too large will make your feet bigger!I've been friends for years with someone who is myopic, and worn her old glasses for long periods, hoping to make myself myopic, but, apart from getting a headache if I wore them too much,did not cause me to develop myopia, in fact, when I turned 40 I found I was HYPEROPIC, like most of my paternal cousins,and was told by my eye man That I had probably been, only me strong accomodation had prevented it being picked up at a school eye exam. </p><p> Best wishes Tanya</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2004, 08:59</p><p>Tod: Ah well, that makes a bit more sense, unfortunately however I'm not aware of what fine tuning my eyes are doing, and I don't have any control over it anyway! I think I'm going to butt out of these disccusions because the more I learn the less I seem to understand. I think I'll stick to admiration. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>WHAT!?</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2004, 23:13</p><p>Tod - </p><p>You are totally wrong.  Accomodation varies.  Kids can have a lot (-10.00 or more).  Older adults can have none.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2004, 21:15</p><p>Electra, if you are 20/20 and put on -3.50 glasses and can see some what , thats because you are using your near focusing accomodative power to do so. most people have -1.5 diopted near focus ability. so when you put on the -3.50's and subtract -1.50 that leaves -2.00 so you are seeing what a +2.00 hyperope sees because it would take +2.00 over all that to give you 20/20. Now when putting on +1.00 glasses this would make you a -1.00 myope. sense there is no accomodative power in the eye to overcome the plus lenses you put on , of course its worse vision for you. But also if you were to put on the -3.50 lenses again and not use your accomodative power then your vision would be bad also. I hope this makes sense!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2004, 09:23</p><p>You guys are all way too uptight.  Jeez, we've had at least one dingbat here saying how he loves to surreptitiously drug his girlfriend with Atropine because he likes the look of dilated pupils and no one spoke up (well, I did, and got a considerable amount of abuse for that). </p><p> </p><p>At any rate, Mr. Fuck All is either an astigmat (in addition to being a hyperope) or he's presbyopic, or has some other reason for loss of accoommodation.  +3 is easily overcome by small to moderate accommodation, espacially when the target is at infinity or near to it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2004, 03:34</p><p>That apart, I don't think +3 is considered low hyperopia; and as far as that goes a -3 myope can't see too well bareyed either. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Theresa</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2004, 13:53</p><p>Electra, </p><p>That's exactly the way to do it. By wearing your friend's -3.5D glasses you are seeing the way a 3.5D hyperope sees. Actually you are probably seeing as a -3.0D hyperope sees because of the distance between the lenses and your eyes. A more accurate way would be to wear -3.5D contact lenses. As you noticed, a hyperope with good accommodation can focus easily on distant objects and often down to quite short distances as long as their prescription is quite low, which 3.5D is. As the hyperopic person gets older and they lose their accommodation they will be unable to focus on nearer objects and may not even be able to bring objects at infinity into focus</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2004, 11:04</p><p>Tod: That will only work if it's a higher prescription. With my 20/20 vision I can see through my buddy's -3.50 glasses, it hurts like hell, but it's in focus, but trying to see through just +1.00 glasses all I get is a blur. I've come to the conclusion that you can get a good idea of what myopia is like using plus lenses of the opposite value, but it's not so straightforward the other way around. I'd be interested to see if others agree with me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2004, 10:14</p><p>bb, the best way to have you understand how a hyperope sees when not wearing glasses. </p><p>You said are nearsighted. Well, if you have contact lenses the put them on and now put you regular prescription glasses on over top while wearing your contact lenses. Now, you will be unable to read and your distance vision is also out of focus.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2004, 10:37</p><p>Brenda, </p><p>I wonder if you originally were given glasses because of crossed eyes, which can happen to kids who have more than the usuual amount of hyperopia. I've also read that early treatment with plus glasses can interfere wiith the normal emetropization(sp?) - that is the natural tendency to get less hyperopic as a child grows. However, the alternative, with turned eyes is a lack of eye development, so you'd probably rather have the fine corrected vision that you currently have, than have really unbalanced vision, a cross eyed appearance and, by now, slightly weaker glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Now, is it just my observation, or is it just a fact of life, but does it not seem like the optical industry has put more effort into satifying the needs of myopes over those of hyperopes? I think I read somewhere that hyperopes actually would benefit from a different type of progressive lens design than what is currently available, and that available progressives are probably easier for myopes to adapt to, even tho us hyperopes need them more! </p><p> </p><p>Is there anything to this?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BB</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2004, 07:37</p><p>Brenda, </p><p> </p><p>There are many reasons for poor sight, it could be something past on by your parents, it could be an illness when you were young such as measels rubela, por sight can miss a generation then come back again. Brenda the good thing about your far sight is apart from needing glasses to correct your vision your eyes seem very healthy, if its any consolation I think you may find your Rx will stabilise for a number of years. </p><p> </p><p>I appreciate your high plus RX and you prefer contacts, actually contacts give better vision and slow the progression of poor sight, so your wise to wear contacts, although once indoors wearing glasses is wise to rest your eyes. </p><p> </p><p>So Brenda I don,t think you have anything to worry about and you may never know the reason why you were born with poor vision. </p><p> </p><p>In time if you have to wear your glasses all the time it will be no big deal, your not judged on your glasses, its you as human being and your personality that counts, and those who would judge you on your glasses are shallow and not worth knowing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2004, 18:54</p><p>Aliena I think that being "farsighted" is the commom term for hyperopia as opposed to nearsighted=myopia.  My impression is that early hyperopia tends to decrease with growth as time goes on but I stand to be corrected in this. </p><p>Brenda, I am no expert, but I think that the cause of hyperopia is just that the optical system of the eye is not arranged for perfect focus.  The lens may be thin, the cornea may be a bit flat or, more likely, the eyeball may be a little short.  Your RX of +8 or9, if it was myopia of -8 or 9  would not be extreme or rare.  Your glasses probably look fine and, IMHO, you should not be ashamed to wear them or worried about your vision.</p><p></p><hr>

In your opinion being farsighted...How do you think I became so farsighted without having anything wrong with my eyes in the first place.

<p><b>TimTom</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2004, 02:56</p><p>Thanks guys for your help. I have contacted both the stores. No good news so far.  </p><p> </p><p>David, I do have separate reading glasses of +16. Fair good but mostly I read with a CCTV whenever possible. Thick books go only as talking books.  </p><p> </p><p>I can use only one eye for reading and  because of strong nystagmus only one corner of my right eye is suitable for reading. A bifocal with rading segment mounted in the right spot is better for me than a whole strong lens. Since I am working with computers I need to switch between distance and close views very often. I couldn't do at all without Bifocals. Have tried.  </p><p> </p><p>I'll let you know later how this goes. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David_Llewellyn</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2004, 23:01</p><p>TimTom! </p><p>Interesting problem you have there. Why do you need such a high add power? What do you use it for? If you frequently need it, especially for long periods of time, have you considered getting monofocal glasses with your total add power in it (ie, if you're distance power is +12, get +17 glasses with no bifocal). This will give you the full frame at the add power, and you can easily get any power, even +20 or more. If you have to constantly switch this won't help you, but if you're reading, doing surgery, whatever, for a substantial period this could be a good way to go. </p><p>BTW, I understand that you can synthesize high add powers with small stick on Fresnel lenses. These are extremely flat lenses which have a sawtooth pattern cut in them, fine like a diffraction grating. They have high plus powers! You can buy them in sheets and cut them with scissors!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Marlene</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2004, 12:54</p><p>Steff. </p><p>I fully agree with the previous post. See that your daughter has stronger glasses as soon as possible. I also have a Down's syndrome child who is extremely nearsighted, and has needed frequent increases in her prescription. She is now ten years old and her prescription is now, right eye -15, left eye -13.5. She has an eye exam every six months to be sure she keeps her vision corrected as well as possible.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2004, 08:48</p><p>steff </p><p> </p><p>Almost certainly your daughter needs a new prescription for stronger glasses.  This is normal when children are growing.  So, please see your ophthalmologist as soon as you can so that she can get the new lenses she needs quickly.  </p><p>I don't know about VI, but I would say that 7.0 (probably more now) is a moderate prescription. I believe myopia is common in Down's Syndrome children and her prescription will probably gradually increase as she continues to grow. Don't worry!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>steff</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2004, 21:43</p><p>Hi  ? for you all. My daughter is 6 years old and has been wearing her specs since 10 months old. recently her glasses don't seem strong enough for her. Every appt with the ped opthomologist her vision has increased.Not by too too much but every time.  So...her last appt a year and a half ago her script went from a 5.75 to 7.0.NOW she seems to have a hard time like her glasses aren't strong enough.Weare seeing him in a month....BUT I am wondering is this a really high script? Would she benfit from a VI specialist at school.? She has Down's syndrome but is extremely verbal  and can voice her wants and needs and this NON complainer has been giving me lots of cues her eyeglasses are   once again not strong enough. She rubs  her eyes(she wears her specs so well never takes em off) the second she gets her specs off and rests her head on her desk at school after minor writing tasks. Anyone have any info for me???? I'd really appreciate it as her eye doc(optho) at UCLA who is infamous for treating a GIANT percentage of the pediatric sp needs population seems like he is great at what he does BUT I would like to know more about a VI and if you all think that it would be a good service for my girl Olivia as she already has so many things going against her anyways THANKS Steff</p><p></p><hr>

One girl said that she could see something if she could read something if she held the paper to her face with my glasses on. One other person said she got a instant headache. I tried on other people glasses too over my contacts. One person said she was a +3 and I could see so much better with hers over my contacts. It scared me because I am already +8, +9.

<p><b></b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2004, 03:38</p><p>Ky </p><p>Good to know that u have not vanished form ES - as it happens many a times here. Yes, it is true that getting thicker lenses can't  be that amusing to anyone. I have read about one lady having +32 in one eye and +14 in the other (long time back in ES) and she used to wear a combination of contacts and glasses. I have a little astigmatism in my right eye - ie .5 or 90 degrees, that is all. The problem with me is that I can't stand the idea of other people seeing me in glasses. So even though I did get a pair, I have never been able to wear it regularly. The thing is unless the frames are really small, it never looks ok on me - I have sort of a  slender face.  </p><p>The thing which produces distortion of eyes is the astigmatism - more so in plus lenses , isn't it? All things notwithstanding, fact is - I can't help not taking note of any females around with galsses. They make her look meysteriously beautiful - and it really seems to be taking its toll on me.

<p><b>David_Llewellyn</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2004, 09:04</p><p>Kathy etc: Concerning hyperopia: it is called "farsightedness" because with it, a person generally sees better at a distance than close up, (more in focus), but that doesn't mean necessarily sees well. When totally relaxed, a normal ("emmetropic") eye is focussed at infinity. If you be hyperopic, then when relaxed your eye focusses beyond infinity. Unfortunately, nobody lives there, it's worse than Oakland! So you must add, thru accomodation (muscle power) an equivalent power to bring your eyes to focus at infinity, e.g., if you have a +3 D power, your eyes must add +3. When you are young, this is no problem, but as you age, this constant accomodation requirement will cause eyestrain and can be unsupportable. How if you have a high plus Rx, say +10, you cannot possibly supply that much power. In that case your vision will be poor even at infinity. (Of course, since you can only accomodate "in", not "out" (ie., you can add power, but you can't take it away), nearsighted people of even low powers cannot focus at infinity. This is why even mild myopes will usually wear glasses full time whereas mild hyperopes often don't). </p><p>Returning to hyperopia: if you are trying to focus closer than infinity, where most people live, you must add even more power, causing even more eyestrain. </p><p>Another point: it is commonly thought that you become more hyperopic with age, leading many myopes to think their Rx will vanish or be reduced with age. While there is a small effect of this type, and obviously everyone is an individual, for the most part this effect is very small. People with -3 or whatever should not expect to have their myopia cured. Rather, the loss of accomodative power is often confused with hyperopia, because both utilize a plus lens for correction. But a myope with presbyopia STILL needs the same minus lens to see at infinity as the same myope sans presbyopia. So age doesn't cure myopia: worse than that, it usually means you need bifocals. If you are a high myope, tho, you can slide your glasses down a little. You can also remove them completely to see close. A hyperope must add more power to see close than at infinity, increasing eye strain even further. So whereas a -3 myope with a +1 add has a reading Rx of -2 (less powerful than distance Rx); whereas a +3 hyperope w/same +1 add has a reading Rx of +4 (i.e, do the math!). Hope that helps and clears up some confusion.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2004, 08:37</p><p>Yeah, the pediatric base curves in Silisoft go that high.  I don't think adult BCs do, but I could be wrong.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2004, 08:30</p><p>Right, I've seen B&amp;L; Silsoft availabe online with RX up to +32.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2004, 07:08</p><p>Kathy: What about those times when your eyes are tired or irritated and you can't wear your contacts?

<p><b>Kathy</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2004, 06:29</p><p>Badfedi- </p><p>Sorry it took me awhile to reply. All I see without my glasses is colors and blur at all distances. The dr. wanted me to get +3.50 add for my left eye and a +2.25 add for the right eye. So I got these glasses made. They were so thick even with the high index, I refused to take them my eyes were super magnified and all distorted. I also have a slight astigmatism in my left eye. The optitian said she would take the add out of the glasses. I could see really well with them but am too vain. So now I have my contacts and wear the add only as glasses over my contacts. So total my left eye is about +12.50 and right eye is +10.25. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2004, 15:54</p><p>Kathy and others, it seems to depend on the amount of correction if you can see in the distance or not.

<p><b>Lisa</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2004, 17:27</p><p>Hi Sarah, </p><p> </p><p>I agree with you. Once you're beyond a certain point of myopia, it really doesn't make any difference. Certainly, minus 10 is more chalenging than minus 4 but let me assure you I've "lost"my glasses on many an occasion and had to actually use an older pair at lower power to find them. Lesson is: always put your specs in the same place so you can find them with your eyes closed (or open with 20/400 vision)LOL! </p><p> </p><p>Lisa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sarah</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2004, 12:42</p><p>Lisa -- it's all relative.  In some sense, having glasses that are -4 isn't that much different from glasses that are -10 because (like you said) either way it's hard to go without them.  But there really is a difference in just how blurry things are and how much of a struggle it is to try to fight through the blur and do something without the glasses.  I just thought of another big difference: somewhere in there, it gets a lot harder to FIND your glasses if you don't remember exactly where you put them.  I definitely make it a point to put mine where I'll be able to find them again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lisa</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2004, 11:52</p><p>Thank you to whomever sent the information on diopter correlations. I knew I was vision-challenged without my glasses but now I have some idea just how much! I suppose after 20/400 you just stop counting as those of us at this level of myopia are not better off than others who are at say 20/600 or 20/800 as none of us could function without our glasses, even though my lenses at -4 are "weak" compared to most of what is discussed in this forum. I look forward to reading future posts. </p><p> </p><p>Lisa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lisa</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2004, 04:21</p><p>I've been wearing glasses for 30 years and my prescription is now around a minus 4 in each eye with a plus 2 add. Each exam yeilds a stronger distance correction but I have to admit after reading the posts on this forum, I am probably not in the strong glasses category that most others are. I must say, however, that I cannot do anything without my glasses on so maybe we're all in the same boat anyway! </p><p> </p><p>I have two questions: First, why does my vision continue to get worse (I thought as one got older the distance correction got weaker)and Second, is there some correlation between my -4 prescription and my acuity without glasses? I see 20/20 with correction, but wondered how blind I am without correction (I can't see the big letters on the chart). Thanks to all. </p><p> </p><p>Lisa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;23 Jan 2004, 20:46</p><p>Nancy, Suzanne and others it may help. I've had my blended aspheric lenticulars for a couple of weeks and I have gotten pretty much used to them now. They seemed odd at first with blurred peripheral vision but thats not so noticeable now. The most marked difference is the better appearance without the obvious edge of the power section. Now I can recommend them to others</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James T.</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2004, 19:58</p><p>Filthy:  That's a good one - the "boner test"!  And a very true one, at least for me... </p><p> </p><p>I've often wondered what the Boner Test equation and graph would look like.  What I mean is - The amount of, um, "stiffness" in proportion to the woman's prescription. </p><p> </p><p>I guess it depends on your own personal feelings/preferences... But, I would assume that, for most of us, it wouldn't be a linear graph.  A prescription of +2 or -2 would yield twice the stiffness of a +1 or -1 script.  A script of +4 or -4 would yield twice the stiffness of a +2 or -2 script. </p><p> </p><p>But then... a +8 or -8 wouldn't quite yield twice the stiffness of a +4 or -4.  It might only yield 1.874 times more stiffness. </p><p> </p><p>Eh, maybe not... Who knows?  I'm just a big math geek.  All I know is, whenever I'm in the record store where that girl with the +8's (or maybe +10?) works, and I'm buying something, I've got to be standing awfully close to that counter to hide my, ummm, feelings :-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jaymac</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2003, 02:57</p><p>Julie, </p><p> </p><p>I cannot speak for high + lenticular lenses of either type, but as a wearer of extremely high minus lenticulars (over -40.00) I can say that in practice the very much better cosmetic appearance of the blended lenses fat outweighs any slight blurry edge effect. In any case, one becomes accustomed to them in a matter of a few hours.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2003, 19:47</p><p>Nancy, thanks for your reply.I guess there won't be much less vis than with non blended, I was just worried about that transition area between the main viewing central part of the lens and the carrier section.At the moment it is a sharp change from clear to nothing, with blending I believe that there is a blurry area at the edges. This may be a bit awkward.I'm +13/+15.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nancy</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2003, 07:31</p><p>Julie: </p><p>I don't have any experience with blended aspheric lenticulars.  I heard that aspherics are not available above +9, and I'm +14  with polycarb lenticulars.  Any lenticular lens + or -, you have to look thhrough the middle, there is always peripheral distortion.  With my tunnel vision, I don't have any peripheral vision anyway, and the lenticular lenses produce effectively tunnel vision. </p><p>What is your prescription?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2003, 15:59</p><p>Nancy or Tanya, Can either of you recommend blended aspheric lenticular lenses, if not, why not? I've not had the blended type before but they were suggested by my doctor. She qualified the recommendation by warning me that there may be some peripheral distortion.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2003, 15:50</p><p>point taken - but they seem like the sort of firm where it might be possible to get them to fit lenses into a frame you choose and send. Might be worth asking them. Let us know how you get on! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brille</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2003, 10:58</p><p>Thanks Oscar. I have visited the Optical4Less site and I am very eager to order from them but they will have to improve their range of frames first, I much prefer small frames for a strong correction and I don't mind paying extra for a good frame. I currently have 2 pairs which do not exceed 40mm in width and they considerably reduce lens edge thickness.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2003, 10:40</p><p>and I meant to add that the whole package seems to come at at around 300 USDollars, which is amazingly good value given the very positive testimonials from customers (one of whom talks about her 16 year old daughter who wears -16 lenses already...what a glorious prospect...)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2003, 10:39</p><p>Brille - have a look at the site of optical4less.com (in Hong Kong) who will do myodiscs by mail order up to -30.50, plano or bi-concave. They will also do other lenses for very high prescriptions. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brille</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2003, 06:44</p><p>I recently visited an optician as I would like to buy some new -20's but was alarmed to find the price astronomical. The price of the lenses went up to 300  for each one. Plus the price for a designer frame, this could equate to over 900 . I am astonished at these prices in Europe.</p><p></p><hr>

I also took my wife along as even she needed a break  and also she wanted to try out her new glasses outisde.  Thus we had a work cum pleasure trip. </p><p>    At the conference during  a paper presentation though we sitting right up front ( of course at my wifes insistence )  I was shocked to see that my wife just could not read anything on the large LCD projection screen,  even pretty large letters,  and she was her brand new glasses with her latest prescription.  I was very much disturbed as it made me realize then as to how bad her eyesight had become.  She also did not even complain ( which is something unusual ), she was occassionally squinting and would push her glasses up against her eyes.  I really felt sorry for her and i think that she has slowly come to accept the fact that she will have to manage with less than perfect eyesight.  I was shattered and never thought that her her vision was soo poor.  And i just dont understand how it happened that too at this age and to a doctor who has the best possible medical care at their disposal. To her credit she was very cheerful. </p><p>    We were having a good time untill  during the banquet when we were getting down the dimly lit stairs she slipped or tripped and fell and badly sprained her right ankle.  To our badluck she was wearing  her new  bifocals in small gold frames and that too at my insistance.  Now she has a torn ligament and her foot is in crepe bandage and she is blaming her bifocals for that.  It might have been a freak accident but she insists that as she getting down the stairs she was seeing through the reading segment and thus could not see properly and fell.  Anyway now I am sure she is not even going to touch the bifocals and I really feel guilty that That i was the one who made her wear them. </p><p>    Actually i had even planned for her to start driving,  but now the plans are shelved.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc 1</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2003, 05:25</p><p>Today we went to the optician and my wife took three pairs of glases.   We nearly spent a couple of hours there, with my wife trying various frames  and for the first time also tried various frames  using the digital camera and the monitor.  She appeared mighty pleased with her choice in the end.  I had taken a day off thus had ample time and let her take her time deciding frames. </p><p>      She took small gold metal ovals  for her bifocals with clear white lenses, inspite of the optician advising her against it.  She said hat those were supposed to be her regulars, which she is going to wear most of the times and in the clinic also. I really hope and wish that she keeps up the optimism.  Then she took one pair in rather large and funky plastic frames, with  photochromatic lenses without the add for reading,  which she intends to use when outdoors and also when she starts driving ( i hope Soon).  The last pair that she took were inexpensive clear plastic rectangularish frames , very small in size for distance only.  I saw her a bit upbeat today.  Hope it is sustained.  Even   though  the three pairs costed quite a bit,  i went along with her and gave in to everything she wanted.   One thing i got from her is  thatshe has agreed to donate her old glasses to Lions Eyeglasses recycling program  for distribution to needy people.  She has tons and tons of eyeglasses,  some of them i think she did not even wear even once.  They have gone staright from the optician to the cupboard.  For a long time i wanted her to donate them, but she was refusing to do it ,  and once when she was out,  i gave some of them off,  and we had a massive fight that day. </p><p>    By the way Lore,  you seem to be a lady with some pretty strong convictions.   I would like to know more about you?   like your qualifications and what you do, etc.  I will try to get my wife to correspond with you. </p><p>    And S4e thanks for the wishes.  Sure my wife needs them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2003, 06:25</p><p>Well, Doc 1, you have put things pretty plainly.  I meant no disrespect when I said that this discussion livens up the forum, I just meant that to have something worthwhile to discuss is a nice change.  As you said, we are what people perceive us to be, and we loose our confidence when we have a poor feeling of this. And, if your wife isn't confident about her vision, then her patients are not either.  I feel certain that things will improve with a pair of bifocals that she will wear, and give an honest trial.  It is hard to get used to bifocals, but almost everyone has to do it at one time or another.  I now feel that there will be much more research done before any steps are finally taken, and that is good.  I also understand your wife's reluctance to talk about her vision troubles.  I certainly wish you both the best.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2003, 04:40</p><p>Lore.  Thank you for the posts.  I very well understand the point that you are trying to convey.

Till about some time time back, she was( and still is) a very sensible, intelligent and level headed person, and also a very cheerful and outgoing personality. I respect her both personally and professionally and she has played a major role in many of my decisons.  Even in medical school she was a topper and had the choice of getting into various specialities.  She was very much interested in surgical field, but due to her worsening eyesight took a rather painful decision and became a Family physician. She then thought of becoming a pathologist, but after her first post dropped that as in Histopathology the eyestrain (due to constant peering through the microscope ) was too much for her to handle.  Thus she has compromised a lot in life and has taken it in her stride, for which i really admire her. Even now she was very successful and busy as a family physician.   I dont know why I am telling you all this personal details,  but i think you should know,  all the more so because I am feeling hurt and maybe guilty  also after reading the posts.  At least it will help you understand what I am going through. </p><p>    I admit even I am ashamed of just even the thought coming to my mind.  I just wanted your advice about what might have been a remote possibility, as i have found you all to be very helpful and more so because majority of you here are high myopes and personal experiences and few might have undergone something like that.  Believe me I never even for a moment thought that she is having good vision and is making it all up.  For all these years i have been witness to her problems, the struggle to find her glasses, the squinting, the peering at close objects,  even her posture has changed due to the constant peering ( she is a rather  tall woman).  It is really painful you know to see a confident woman ,  a doctor who is supposed to help in curing others reduced to this.  Thus You know even I am under LOt of STRAIN and just confided my worst fears and thoughts to you all.  YOu see It is not important that everything that you all are suggessting need be right, but what is important is that you are trying to be of help, I value that.  </p><p> I am just not going to push my wife into Lasik just because someone on the net told me. I am doctor and we will take our own decisions.  I have left all the decisions to my wife, and i will be very happy if she takes them,  but right now she is unable to take her own decisions and thus looks to me for help.  I just cannot runaway from her telling her that it is her problem and she should solve it and as she is grown up it is her business. I can never do that. I am a responsible Husband. Pl dont blame me for her state.  Agreed , that I sometimes loose my temper and get irritated whcih is more frequent of late, but even I am human.  You are very much right that someone has to break the cycle and I will definitely try to control my temper and spend more time with her.  I have done some introspection , thanks to you.  But there is nothing like a GEnder male/female bias or problem like you have assumed.  I have not said about women in particular and have a healthy respect for them. Pl dont take it personally.  I value your advice and if possible give me your e mail address. </p><p> My first priority is for her to get back to normal usual self and that is only possible when she starts her medical practice and gets back to work.  Thus this effort to get her wear the bifocals so that she will be able to function properly and get involved in work that will keep her occupied and divert her mind from other issues.  She  was doing this thing of moving/tilting her glasses down the nose for reading,  and pushing them back against her eyes whenever she wanted to see in the distance. She was managing this way,  but now it has got to a point where it dosent work anymore and she just holds her writing pad within inches from her face and writes down.  Even with that she says that she cannot see fine print.   She also started carrying a hand held magnifier in her purse.  You see if she was in any other profession which involved some office work or something else, it would not have mattered even if she peered at things or used a hand held magnifying glasses,  but you see she is a clinician and deals with deals with patients where your appearance and behaviour count a lot.  The patient looks up to the doctor by reposing his faith in him (that is why it is called a noble profession) but when he/she sees that the doctor is not confident or sure of herself, it conveys a very negative message and next time they turn up elsewhere.  YOu see, I have no love for bifocals and have no intention to force her to wear them as long as she is comfortable with her regular glasses, but it is not so and the ophthalmologist said that the only solution other than any intervention is she use bifocals.  Thus I was pinning my hopes on them, but i feel she is not even giving them a fair trial and thus i am disappointed more so that i cannot do anything much about her problem , leading to frustration and maybe rash decisions. I Hope not.  If she is unhappy then she can very well discard them.  I know that it barbaric to hide her glasses because Only she knows and I know how helpless she is without them. She says that without glasses she just sees diffuse bolbs and colours, and thus feels for glasses every morning even before opening her eyes. There have been instances when they had fallen down from the bedside stand and other places and she was on her fours crawling around and searching for them by feeling with her hands.  Is was really pathetic to see her that way.  She also has this fear of loosing her glasses and always carries a spare pair in her purse, another one in the glove compartment of our car and in other probable places in the house where she can find them easily.  Thus I cannot and will never hide her glasses.  The idea  just conveys my desperation to help her.  And i am sure the moment I do anything of that sort, she will leave me.  </p><p>  Though i should not say it,  but I have been trying to help her at every step , trying to make her comfortable ,  recently we even got a bigger 29 inch plasma Television, changed our computer monitor to a bigger one and got her a mobile phone handset with a larger diaplay and contrast.  I know it is not a thing to gloat about as i have done for my wife only,  but i am just mentioning them  as i feel I am being made out to be a villian. </p><p>    No s4e, my wife dosent know that i am discussing this with you all, and i dont intend to tell her also.  She is very touchy about discussing her vision with others and and she was really upset with me once when I  casually answered some questions about her eyesight from her close friend whom I thought knew about it.  But i will try to persuade her to correspond with other people with similar visual problems so that she will feel that she is not the only high myope with such problems.  This may also stop  tedency to go for self pitying , which is slowly setting in. </p><p>     The only thing of some cheer for me is that she asked for bifocals in a small frame with the thinesst posibble lenses, this is after much reasoning and persuation and thus after this weekend i will be accompanying her to the optician. </p><p>   Well,  as for my wife being  fictitous, I dont want to say anything on that.  Because only I know what it is to see someone close to you getting slowly demoralized, both personally and professionally. Who inspite of being a Doctor (and a one time Gold medalist in medicine) feeling helpless and useless. This  is not just to liven up a old forum.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2003, 16:46</p><p>Oh, I understand Lore.  However, I have had an enjoyable time here, feeling that for once some of the research I have done has paid off.  I do not care to speculate, I just know that something like this livens up the old forum for a change.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2003, 13:33</p><p>specs4ever </p><p> </p><p>Please know that I wasn't talking specifically about you.  I just think that, if Doc1's wife is indeed a real person, then we are all being very unfair to her, conjecturing about what she is feeling, that she might be lying, what she needs, how she sees.  It just feels like a silly thing to do.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2003, 13:31</p><p>Sorry to keep posting, but I'm finding this rather infuriating, as a woman, no offense to anyone involved. </p><p> </p><p>Why on earth would anyone assume Doc1's wife is exaggerating about her poor vision?  Because all woman are so vain they'd do anything not to wear glasses?  Because all women are too stupid to know whether they are seeing well or not?  Or, because all women are manipulating shrews who will lie to men at every turn?  Come on, people.   </p><p> </p><p>If his wife says her vision is poor, it is poor.  I don't know if Doc1 is for real.  If not, then all of this is fine.  If Doc1's wife is a fictional construct, then go ahead and accuse her of all the manipulation you want to accuse her of, and assume that you all know better about how she feels than she does all you want. </p><p> </p><p>But if she is a real-life person (and there is a chance of that), this is totally unfair and ridiculous, IMHO.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2003, 13:29</p><p>Doc 1, I pretty well have to agree with Lore in both the last 2 posts. Suggestions we can give, but only she can really know what is going on.  If it isn't too pertinant, can I ask you if you have talked to her about the conversations you are having here.  If so, what does she feel about this?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2003, 13:25</p><p>And, it would be WRONG to hide your wife's other glasses.  She is an adult.  Her glasses belong to her, not to you.  She will wear what she is comfortable wearing.  Many high myopes are more comfortable NOT wearing bifocals, and just push the glasses further from their eyes when they read.  That works fine for them.  A lot of high myopes find bifocals useless and would rather just adjust the distance of a single-vision lens to and from their eye.  Those are decisions for your wife to make. </p><p> </p><p>I hate to say it, but maybe part of why she is (supposedly) acting so helpless lately is because you are treating her that way, even if you are doing it with the best of intentions.  Hiding glasses is what you would do with a child (and I think even that would be wrong), not something you do with an adult woman.  Perhaps your reactions and her feelings are feeding one another, with her feeling more helpless, you treating her more like a helpless child, and she then feeling even more helpless.  You should be the one to stop the cycle but recognizing that your wife is an intelligent, mature, fully-functioning adult person who is capable of making rational decisions.  Allow her to make those decisions, rather than assuming that anyone here would know what is best for her better than she does.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2003, 13:24</p><p>It is funny Doc 1, but I had considered the possibility that she is exagerating a bit just how poorly she sees.  This is one thing that is almost impossible to check.  However, it appears to me that she has had a rapid progression from around -10, up to -18 in the last 10 years, and that is a high increase, especially when most myopes level off in their early 20's.  So there might be an underlying problem here. Do you know where her myopia is? In other words, there are 3 places for myopic development.  The most common is eyeball length, then the cornea can be too steep, and finally the lens in the eye can be too much plus.  Ocassionally there can be a combination of all 3. </p><p> </p><p>Whatever you do, don't try to force her to wear her bifocals. That will land you in divorce court.  If she has a chance to try them herself in private, she may decide that they work not too badly on her own. </p><p> </p><p>I have done a lot of experimentation with G.O.C. , and I find that I have no problem when wearing the higher minus glasses to just drop the glasses a bit down my nose, as Lore has suggested.  It really isn't all that noticible (I don't think, and anyway if it is, that is the impression I am trying to convey)   And, as minus powers get higher, the distortion where the bifocal segment is gets pretty bad so dropping the glasses a bit is better. Of course it is hard to do that with cable temples. </p><p> </p><p>I don't blame you for wanting to delay any form of opperation, as they are coming up with new solutions daily.  However, how long can your marriage survive this probblem?  And don't worry about venting your problems here.  We enjoy this stuff.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2003, 13:22</p><p>Doc 1: Those sound like questions you need to ask your wife, not someone on this board who does not know her.  The people here can give you advice in the general sense; only your wife knows what is going on in her particular situation.  She is a professional, grown woman.  She is capable of expressing what she is feeling.  If she says she can't see well with her glasses, then believe her.  I see no reason why you wouldn't.  Only your wife knows the particulars of her situation, and no one her, obviously, is qualified to describe what is going on with her to you.  All of the potential feelings she is having that have been discussed here, are just conjecture.  Only she can tell you how she really feels.  While it's possible people here are right about what's going on in her head, they might also be very wrong.  You need to talk to her and take her seriously, rather than asking strangers for advice about your wife's feelings.  Ask strangers for advice about the *facts* of her situation--what kind of lenses might be best, etc.--but no one here has any authority to claim to know anything about your wife's state of mind, and what might be true for "high myopes in general" (although even that is conjecture) could be very untrue for her.  IMHO, your wife is the *only* one qualified to answer the questions you have.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc 1</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2003, 12:23</p><p>Curt,  Thanks for the advice.  My wife has  got the regular bifocals. I was advised against progressives becoz as a first time bifocal wearer she would have had problems with them. Actually I was ready to get her progressives thinking that the reading segemnt would be invisible thus making her less conscious.  </p><p> What you have said is absolutely right,  the more she wears them the better,  I think it is just a matter of time before she adapts to them ,, provided she wears them.   I was really hoping that with the new glasses her problem would be solved, at least for the time being, so that we can defer the decision about surgery for a few months when even I can avail my leave and thus have time on my hands </p><p>     It seems ridiculous,  but the only solution  that is coming to my mind  to make her wear them is to hide all her glasses expect the bifocals, thus forcing her to wear them as she just cannot function without correction. Though I very much doubt I can do it. </p><p>    S4e I am very  much indebted to you all for your kind help and suggestions.  Despite all the information that you all have given,  you have also given me an opening to discuss my problems and frustrations arising out of my wifes vision.  If I am taking much of your time then I am really sorry.  Pl tell me one thing ,  since you are very experienced in this field, is my wife just rejecting glasses, and is not accepting them even though they may be giving her good vision.  Is there a possibility that she is making it up ,  that she cannot see well with  glasses.  Or she really has a problem with them.  Actually I am confused.  This thought would not have to my mind,  but we have consulted various ophthalmologists  and tried best possible &amp; pretty expensive glasses and still the problem is persisting.  Is there a remote possibility that she is doing this to get more attention?  YOu know this happens with quite a few patients who dont get adequate rest and attention at home and thus exagerate their illness to gain them .  THis happens in my field also,  and after ruling out possible conditions we just reassure them.   </p><p>  You are very right about this feelig she has of her thick glasses conveying this message that she is blind.  I think we will give these new  glasses a fair trial for some time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tammy</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2003, 09:50</p><p>Lore, I have had bifocals for about 5 or 6 years now. My Rx is OD -12.50 x -0.50 x 180 and OS -11.00 x -1.50 x110. You might be right though, seems like i was told that my case was out of the ordinary, since i am not even 40 years old yet.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2003, 08:39</p><p>I thought it was relatively common for people with high prescriptions to *not* have bifocals since they can just push their glasses a little further from their nose to see?  The one really high myope I know (around -15, I'd guess) does just that, and seems to have no problem.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;25 Sep 2003, 06:07</p><p>It is funny how a thread sometimes becomes devoted to a single thing, and how a large number of folks here jump in and try their best to help out with their knowlege as best as we can. </p><p> </p><p>From what I have observed, a person can wear any strength of glasses that they require.  Where it becomes a problem is when the glasses do not correct well.  And this can be at any prescription - even plus.  When you see a high myope dropping their glasses, and peering at a piece of paper held within inches from their face, the observer automatically assumes that that person doesn't see well - even though most often it just means that the person is too cheap to have their eyes tested, and wear bifocals.  Same thing can be said about  person with thick lenses, squinting and struggling to see in the distance.  I really don't know why it is that the optical business is not a one size fits all thing, but it sure isn't. </p><p> </p><p>I am sorry to hear that your wife won't wear her new bifocals, Doc 1, because that is the only way she will ever get accustomed to them.  But, it is a struggle, and with the larger frame size, the glasses I am afraid scream out to her that everyone can see how blind I am.  Much like the rest of the world today, she has her heart set on a quick fix. </p><p> </p><p>I am sorry as well to hear that the time that you are devoting to this matter is causing you problems.  Please, for the both of your sake, try to cheerfully devote your time.  The time spent right now is well spent if you can come up with a solution that works.  Just think how much time it would take if you chose the quickest fix, and your wife was the 1 in 1000 that wasn't fixable, and she ended up with vision problems that could no longer be repaired.  A blind, or partially sighted wife would be a lot more demanding in the long run. </p><p> </p><p>I don't think 18 months is a decent enough period of time to establish that her prescription has stabilized either.  From what I have read, if it doesn't stay stable for a minimum of 2 years, there is a possibility of more change.  I hope your opthalmologist can come up with a solution that is safe, and workable.  I did read also about the Starr implantable lens in one of the journals I got last week.  It is on the fast track for FDA approval in the US, and it apparently has been used in other countries as well.  No more details, I'm sorry.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;24 Sep 2003, 12:58</p><p>Doc 1: One piece of advice that may help...when someone first gets bifocals (did she get traditional flat tops or progressives?), there is a tendency to be mesmorized by the bifocals and to try looking at everything through them.  What I mean is that when walking along a sidewalk, rather than looking ahead as you would normally if you were wearing single vision lenses, there is a tendency to peer down through the addition, which can be quite disorienting.  If she got progressives, this is made even worse by the peripheral distortion that happens on the edges of the lens. </p><p> </p><p>My suggestion is that she forget that there is a bifocal addition in the glasses and just wear them.  If you look on the internet, there are several references (I can give you the URLs if you want) that tell you one of the most important aspects of getting used to wearing bifocals is that you should wear them full-time for the first 2-3 weeks after you get them, even if you don't need them for everything.  If you don't, you will never get used to wearing bifocals.  But trying them on for 15-20 minutes at a time and then taking them off and putting your old glasses on is not a good idea. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc 1</b>&nbsp;24 Sep 2003, 11:41</p><p>S4e,  Regarding your finding that myopes in their teens having poor correction than higher myopes.  I canot say much on that , the only thing that I have noticed there are more amd more high myopes to be seen now a days esp younger people,  or i am being more observant and the fact.  YOu may be right as even my wife is in her teens. </p><p>     Regarding the add for reading,  i thought that +2 is rather strong for a start.  But you may be right.  Becoz most of the presbyopes i have seen start from about+1. I will tell my wife that. </p><p>      You are right about the new glasses not solving my wifes problem ( you are a wizard in this field man).  I spent quite a bit thinking she would be happy and satisfied with the new glasses.  She was very much displeased with the bifocals as they are quite thick, anyway i convinced her to wear them but she tried them and said that she could not manage with them and stopped using them.  The other pair with the metal curved ear pieces,  she says they are ok and is using them but not without the chain, but she says her vision is the same with them.  So we are back to square one.  One consolation is that she is at least wearing them. </p><p>     Regarding the lens Implants I asked our regular ophthalmologist about it,  he told me that he is more of an expert on Lasik and dosent have much exposure with lens implants,  but he has promised me to refer her to his friend who know about them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc 1</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2003, 22:29</p><p>S4e even here some places have a digital camera which takes your pic and then various frames van be added to it which you can see on a computer monitor.  Also some take pictures directly with you wearing the glasses and then it can be visualized on the screen.  But you knowI find these proceedures very tedious and time consuming where the person tends to never get satisfied and keeps on trying various frames.  Thus my wife first selects four or five frames wearing her old glasses ,  she gives them a thorough inspection holding them close enough, then she tries them on and asks me for the final choice.   </p><p>   To be honest with you S4e this whole phase since my wifes eyesight has deterioated is taking a toll n my work also.  I am really fed up of the frequent visits to various ophthalmologist &amp; opticians.  In the process i daresay that i have gained so much information in this field that i sometimes feel it would have better if i became an ophthalmologist.  Thus lately  I am persuading my wife to go alone or with some of her friends, but she is adamant that I come.  It has become all the more avoidable since she has stopped driving.  You know earlier I used to look forward to accompanying her and in fact enjoyed helping her out and trying various frames on her.  I am afraid it is not so now. </p><p>    You are right about the large frame size.  yes the lenses are really thick which is very obvious from the sides.  I think it is no big deal,anyway you are a glasses wearer,  a bit more thicker ones should not matter much to the wearer.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2003, 20:14</p><p>I suspected that you were not from Canada or the USA Doc 1.  Here, most good opticians have a type of camera that they use to take a picture of the frames on a person, and then you can see what the glasses look like after you put your own back on.  I guess  that answers your question too Puffin. </p><p> </p><p>I am glad to hear that your wifes prescription has been stable for the last 18 months.  I would be happier to hear that with the new glasses her vision problems have been solved, but I don't think that this is quite so simple.  I really have not ever found an explaination for this, but in a lot of cases a myope with a prescription in the mid teens may often have a lower visual acuity than a person with a much higher prescription.  Some people see fine with -25D glasses.  I have never gotten a straight answer for this.  One group of doctors talking about this on a Deja news group a few years back mentioned that theoretically the strength of the prescription shouldn't matter, that a person could be corrected to 20/20 with the right lenses.  But of course there is the minification factor, and whether or not the eye is basically healthy, and a few other items that i can't remember right now.  I would like to know the reason for this myself - if in fact there is a reason that can be established, without being conjecture. </p><p>Probably your wife was in need of bifocals for a few years now, so it doesn't suprise me that her first bifocal is a +2 add.  This add lowers the minus power of  her lens, which is a different thing than raising a plus powered lens.  Minus adds are quite often larger, where a beginning prestyope only needs a +1 or so. </p><p>Yes, it is better to have a larger lens for a bifocal.  However, the edge thickness can create a problem with distortion of vision around the edges.  Your wife only sees through the very center portion of her lens anyway.  Personally I would have preffered to have had the edges thinned down - a simple procedure of flattening the back of the lens to give it a myodisc effect. But I suppose that not too many labs would do this.  I have done it myself with a couple of lenses that were badly chipped on the outer edge, and I have made them look much better. Takes a bit of work with a few different grades of sandpaper, but the end result is worth it to me. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2003, 07:10</p><p>I always wondered how the extremely myopic (and hyperopic) chose their frames. I thought to myself "surely they couldn't see without whatever lenses they usually have, and the trial frames wouldn't have any lenses in." </p><p> </p><p>I like the idea of helping someone (ie female) choose their glasses. I'd be saying "pick the big ones... yeah the big ones!"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc 1</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2003, 07:00</p><p>S4e,  According to my ophthalmologist my wifes Rx has not increased from the past 18 months.  The only change is the add for reading.  He has giver her a prescription of +2. I thought it was a bit toostrong for a start,  and Itold him so. Dont you think so?  But he told me that he had given her an undercorrection and would have to raise it further in due course.  WE got two new pairs of glasses.  One of them are bifocals in black plastic frames in a bigger size frames than routine as the optician told us that in bifocals the you cannot have small frames as the reading segment tends to come in the center ofthe frame thus interfering with distant vision.  The glasses are quite thick with a lot of edge thickness . It was nice to see my wife in bigger frames after many years.  But she is very uncomfortable with them and says that she feels dizzy when ever she looks down and is not wearing them.  The other pair are in very expensive thin metal frames with the earpieces curved and made from spring like material which curves around the ears.  The optician said that with these frames the glasses do not tend to slide down or get knocked down.  Thus I got them hoping that my wife would  stop using those annoying chains around her neck.  Just gotthem yesterday and have to see whether she uses them without those strings/chains.  You see Iget the job of selecting frames for her as she cannot see herselfwhen she tries them on</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony2</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2003, 06:59</p><p>Doc 1 - I am 18, with around -20 and have worn bifocals since I was 12.  All of my younger siblings have them too.  I commented on their prescriptions some time ago.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nancy</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2003, 06:57</p><p>Doc 1: </p><p>You asked about my prescription change, I have worn glasses most of my life.  My myopia increased to about -20, with bifocals from about age 17 when I was around -14.  I'm 22 now.  I also have Retinitis Pigmentosa, so my peripheral vision is decreasing (now around 30 deg.)  RP increases the liklihood of cataracts, which were removed a little over a year ago, hence the + lenses, now about +10. </p><p>Another thing, my eye doc says that with the whole minification thing, most myopes generally should have bifocals when they reach around -10, so maybe your wife is passed due.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2003, 18:05</p><p>If your wife's prescription is still increasing in power, then any form of lasik is out of the question.  I do think after you do more research you will probably decide that the lens implant is likely the best way to go.  I can certainly understand her reluctance to trest patients, as I am sure that if she doesn't have confidence in her vision, she is likely telescoping this feeling through to them </p><p>. And what I especially like about the lens implants is the fact that they can remove them, and replace them fairly easily. </p><p>I assume that you have been to a few specialists with her.  Have they advised any particular procedure?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc 1</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2003, 11:32</p><p>Hi S4e.  Thank you for answering my qustions.  You are quite senior to me and i respect your knowledge,  it is clear that you have taken pains to gain knowledge about glasses and that you are helping others is the big thing.  I can understand about the fascination for glasses as I admit I am one of them.  In fact when I first met my wife, we were together in medical School.  She was a moderate myope then and i was attracted to her staright away.  She wore pretty oversized frames and it was real joy then to watch her squint.  Even then she made it clear that she hated glasses even though by that time she was quite dependent on them.  She would always bend down and take notes from my pad and that thrilled me.  Whenever we were together she would remove her glasses and would be all the more dependent on me which even I enjoyed.  That was the time when we got married about six years back.  She used to have her regular refractions through grudgingly,  and there were stady increases in her Rx  Though myopia progression should have stopped long back .  We even consulted a retinal specialist and he told that the retinas were normal.  Thus it was not even pathological myopia.  her vision was pretty good with correction till she was about -12 ...-13.  Then gradually she started complaining that she was not happy with her Rx and could not see detailsin distance even with the latest prescription.  We even changed our Ophthalmologist , but she just wasn't satisfied with the correction.  We tried everything,  the computerized one and also crosschecked with the manual refraction .' which is better' one type.  But she could never  get fully corrected.  Around the same time we had the problems with contacts and she quit them.   More than the Vision problem it is a psychological problem now.  I dont know what exactly happened, (though i tried asking her)  whether one of her patients commented on her thick glasses &amp; poor eyesight, or whether anyone called her partially blind or something nasty of that sort.  She started cribbing about her eyesight, she was depressed , she also stopped driving at night, though I very well knew that she could manage it then with her glasses.  ARound the same time her practice was on the decline.  She developed very low self esteem, and I think this made her patients loose confidence in her.  You see half the disease is treated by the doctors behaviour with the patient.  Many a times you have to sound confident and reassure the patient , even though you are not.  From the patients point of view,  maybe even she didnt inspire confidence in them,  her thick glasses and the peering type  of look which most high myopes have , and the hunched posture as she used to bend down close and write her notes and prescription maybe made them uneasy.  You see glasses up to certain Rx maybe up to -5 or -8 give a intelligent look to the person more so a doctor,  beyond that they start appearing too thick with disortion and minification of eyes etc,  thus the patient may start wondering whether the doctor treating him can himself see well enough , they may sometimes wonder as to how a person can see through such thick glasses.   To convince a patient or any person for that matter you have to look him directly in the eye and speak,  you cannot avoid seeng him directly and then hope to convince him.  Maybe she found this difficult with such thick glasses.   I think one or two people asked her straight whether she could  see properly.   All these factors combined have landed her now where she is ,  consequently she has taken a break from practice.  The sooner she gets back to work the better for her.   Whether she will undergo any surgical proceedure, and if so which, it is not yet decided,  but one thing is for sure, she definitely needs a boost to her confidence and if any proceedure helps her in seeing better and giving her the much needed self-confidence ,  then its purpose is very well served.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2003, 07:27</p><p>Doc 1 -- I'm around -3, and I've worn contacts for about 12 years.  The past 3 years, I've worn them less, because my eyes were getting irritated by them...for a while I wore contacts only occasionally.  I have tried acuvue lenses, and I **REALLY** do not think highly of them.  First off, they were not comfortable for me; not sure if that was because the fit wasn't quite right, or because the lenses really aren't so good.  But I also found them very difficult to handle - they are so flimsy that it's tough to insert them and keep them in the right position.  A friend of mine I talked to had a similar opinion of the acuvues, and had serious problems with them. </p><p> </p><p>I've tried 2 lenses from the Focus line: "Dailies" (which I wore more like a 2-week disposable), and "Night and Day".  The Dailies are amazingly comfortable - I couldn't feel them in my eyes at all, as long as the lenses didn't start to dry out (which is often a problem for me).  The Night and Day lenses are completely different.  They too were really comfortable for me, though not completely inperceptible like the Dailies...but I can tolerate them all day at work or when I'm tired, etc...much better than any other lens I've tried.  They are designed to resist sticking to the eye, they don't shrink much when they dry out, they supposedly resist bacteria and enzyme accumulation.  So - I think they are worth a try for someone who wants to wear contacts and is able to wear them some but can't tolerate them well...I'm not sure if there is a solution to the prescription issue; I was wondering if Ciba (Focus manufacturer) could be convinced to custom make some stronger lenses then they normally make available.  Worrying about that, though, is probably putting the cart before the horse. </p><p> </p><p>All this said, would your wife consider some therapy?  See, I know it's not a pleasant thing to be a high myope...but I do think it's possible for a high myope to wear glasses all the time and be happy, happy with who they are, not afraid of bad things happening, etc.  I think they can cope with the difficulties of finding their glasses, and so on.  It just depends on how well they are able to deal with their situation.  There are people with really major disabilities who live happy, comfortable lives, so it's definitely possible in your wife's relatively good situation.  (I'm preaching to the choir, I'm sure.) </p><p> </p><p>One other thing: why is inserting contact lenses such a tough thing for her?  I realize she can't see clearly very far...but a couple inches is all you need when putting contacts in, isn't it?  (If you drop one, that's another story, of course.)  I think anxiety might be as much of the problem as the absolute difficulty of the situation. </p><p> </p><p>A lens implant like the Artisan might be a great solution for your wife.  But if it's not, I hope she can regain her comfort and confidence anyway.  I really think it is possible.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2003, 06:33</p><p>I am just a weird type of person who got caught up in optics Doc 1.  First of all I would wonder what it was about glasses that helped a person see better, and why their eyes could see through the lenses and mine couldn't. Then I decided that I was more attracted to girls who wore glasses, but I couldn't really figure out how to put this into practice.  I was goibg with a girl who wore a decent minus prescription, but I ended up marrying my wife, who was a contact lens wearer, but was a fairly low minus - -2.75 or so.  Over the years, her prescription increased, I had a daughter who was a minus, and I began to do a lot of research, as I myself felt that I wanted to be a minus.  I did get myself into a reasonably strong prescription (through accommodation I now know). </p><p> </p><p>I wanted an even stronger prescription for myself, so I started reading all I could on refractive errors, with most of it regarding myopia.  As I aged I could no longer hold the accommodation I was used to, so at this point I found that plus contcts worn under minus glasses could give me vision to represent any prescription.  I have experimented a lot with this. </p><p> </p><p>I found that there were very few people who had the higher prescriptions, and I found that I liked the effect stronger, thicker minus glasses had on the persons face.  So, as time went on, I found the internet, and I became more and more hooked. </p><p> </p><p>Then my wife decided she wanted lasik.  Her prescription had cimbed to around -6D over the years, and she was tired of contact lenses, but wouldn't wear glasses except in an emergency.  I researched, and researched trying to talk her out of it, but her mind was made up. Fortunately, she was a good candidate, and hers was one of the success stories.   </p><p> </p><p>Having found eyescene, I became even more hooked, started writing short stories, and giving people a bit of advice from the information I have picked up over the years.  And, I have picked up more information from researching for the stories. </p><p> </p><p>As much as I like to see ladies in glasses though, I don't like it when their vision becomes a problem.  With Lasik, there have been many many people that have serious problems because of a vanity operation.  These people have created their own problem, so I don't really feel as sympathetic to them as I maybe should.  Last night when I was reading an ophthalmology journal I read an article on a company called Nidek, one of the worlds leading producers of ophthalmology equipment - in particular the lasik machines that so commonly are used for this operation.  I noticed a piture of the president, a Mr. Hideo Ozawa.  Mr. Ozawa is shown wearing glasses - a low minus - maybe around -5D.   I didn't think of it right away, but then it dawned on me.  If the procedure is so safe, why won't this man have his eyesight corrected.   </p><p> </p><p>Anyway this is now a long enough post. I often wish I worked in the eye care field, but I didn't go into it early enough.  I work in construction right now. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2003, 06:27</p><p>All this staring at computer screens for hours on end can't be helping (if you like myopes, then it does help) </p><p> </p><p>I remember being told by parents "don't get too close to the TV, you'll ruin your eyes." It was almost like a reflex action from them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc 1</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2003, 04:54</p><p>Hi S4e. You are a very knowledgeable person and it seems you know a great deal about glasses.  I am sure you have been of help to many people.  By the way what is your profession and are you also a high myope?  You have done a great deal of research into ophthalmology,  is it only by interest or are you related with the medical field. </p><p>   Regarding my wife she has a higher chance of developing cataracts due her own folly,  there is no evidence of it now. And frankly I just dont  want another problem now.  She has more of a chance of developing glaucoma as she has a family history, which is one thing we dread.  Luckily there are no signs ofit right now. </p><p>    Reagrding younger generation having weaker eyesight, yes even I think so,  now after my wifes problems, the more Ihave been oberving people I am finding that there are a significant number ofyoung people with high people.  This is what I tell my wife ,  as a consolation that she is not alone.  You see my mother in law is a myope but heris RX is nowhere compared to my wifes.  She was around as far as Ican remember around -8 before glaocoma set in and her eyesight deteriorated.  My grandmother who stays with me is around 70 ,  has pretty good vision and wears glasses mainly for reading.  She really gives a complex to my wife,  who looks older in front of her.   </p><p>     Leave alone the visual problem and seeing clearly,  since shehas been a myope most of her life , she should have adjusted to less than clear sharp vision by now,  But the psychological Implications are leaving a deep impact oh her.  She now thinks of herself as a sick person which she is not.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2003, 22:32</p><p>One of the things that I was reading while checking different websites for you Doc 1 is that the AAO does not suggest lasik surgery for anyone with a prescription higher than -8D  due to the complications. </p><p> </p><p>Now, the possibility of cataracts forming is interesting, because that could lead to a clear lens replacement in your wife's case. I believe that the natural lens has around +16D.  With this lens gone, your wife could be around a -2D.  It couldn't get any better. </p><p> </p><p>While doing research into myopia,and into this case, I seem to be running across a larger number of higher prescriptions than I thought was out there.  Is the vision of the younger generation getting worse faster, or are there just a lot of high myope wannabee's posting stuff?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc 1</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2003, 21:52</p><p>Alan. She has tried all sorts of contacts lenses.  Staring from rigid, soft lenses, gas permeable ones to the new extended wear ones.  I am not sure whether she has tried Focus lenses,  but she has tried Acuve disposable contact lenses from jhonson. But she could not wear them for long.  One more factor is with her poor uncorrected vision she really has a tough time getting the contacts in. She used to wash her hands umpteen number of times before inserting them &amp; she wants me to be there till she wasdone with it.  After some time this gets on your nerves.  Is there a device which helps to insert contacts, if there isn't ,  then someone should invent it.  we have one full shelf of all types of lens cleaning solutions , deproteinizing  tablets , antibiotic eye drops, steroid eye drops in various combinations.  This is for you all also, NEVER USE any eyedrops for long periods, as they are habit forming especially steroids and in the long run can cause complications of which cataracts is one.  We are on the lookout for evdence of cataract &amp; glaucoma in my wife as she has used steroid eyedrops for many years  just to enable her to wear contact lenses more by reducing the irritation and inflamation.  She also had to use nonprescription clear glasses whenever she went out with contacts to prevent dust &amp; irritation.  </p><p>    Alan what is your Rx and how long have you been wearing contacts. </p><p>  Also NANCY you mentioned about going from a Hich myope to hypermeterope , can you elaborate on that and tell aboutyour visual condition etc.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2003, 17:44</p><p>Just one more thing Lore.  Where would you suggest finding  non internet based information. I remember reading that of the worlds population roughly 30% are myopic, of this 30% only 10% are high myopes(over -9D),and from this 10% there is roughly another 10% that are severe myopes, which I would consider over -15D.  Doc 1's wife is in this last 10%, so where would she find another person in real life to advise her? It is only through the internet that some of these things have been allowed to come out into the open. </p><p> </p><p>I would rather see this phrased in such a way that after discovering something through the internet, unless it can be verified by contact with the person involved, it should be not taken as a factual experience. </p><p> </p><p>And, no I don't really believe that you have a vested interest in lasik, it just seems that you are pushing hard.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2003, 17:35</p><p>Lore, you seem to have jumped on the bandwaggon for lasik surgery in a big way.  Do you have a vested interest in this field? </p><p>I pointed Doc 1 towards a site called surgical eyes, for which I do agree with you that in most cases there is no backup documentation. However, I pointed him in particular towards one patient that had posted her story.  You should have investigated the story before you made your last post. If you had, you would have found that the person - Rebecca Petris, along with a Maggie Dolan have started a separate low budget site of their own to tell their story, and have linked it from this post.  And, from the looks of it, both these people are ready and willing to talk about their own experiences.  And, I think that Rebecca can, and will provide the documentation that you feel is necessary to make the point that while she was told she was an ideal candidate, things didn't work out that well for her. </p><p>I personally don't care what form of correction Doc 1's wife has done. She obviously requires something to enable her to carry on to her best potential.  I just don't want to see anyone end up having the problems this Rebecca Petris describes. And, unless you know the bad points along with the good points, you really can't make a good decision.  I would feel remiss in not pointing out the negatives.  The lasik surgeons sure don't tell you about the ones that went wrong.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2003, 14:20</p><p>The only thing to keep in mind about surgicaleyes.com is that the terms of use states that nothing posted on the bulletin board is verified by the site, and *all* personal stories are posted on the bulletin board.  So, while it is possible that much of most of the stories is true, there is no way to verify them.  Again, I'm not trying to sell laser surgery--and I certainly wouldn't recommend patient testimonals on sites selling the procedure as a good source of information (although most of that is at least verified by the site itself)--but I would highly recommend going to non-internet sources for good, solid info.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2003, 14:04</p><p>Doc 1 -- Thanks for the answers.  I can understand her resistance to contact lenses, given the experiences she had.  I would expect that, at her prescription, contacts would probably give preferable vision.  Did she wear soft lenses or rigid ones?  I know new types of soft lenses keep coming out.  I've been pretty amazed by the Focus Night and Day lens. (I rarely wear it for extended wear, though it's FDA approved for up to 30 days continuous wear.)  It's a lot more comfortable for me than any other lens I've worn.  I think it's only generally available for prescriptions up to -12, but at least it is out there. </p><p> </p><p>Has your wife's prescription changed a lot since you got married?

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2003, 12:44</p><p>Doc 1, if you do go in and check out www.surgicaleyes.com, make sure you read My Story by rebeccap.  It is well written and very informative.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2003, 12:19</p><p>I did think I had tried to be unbiased and helpful Lore.  I have read a lot of the same statements you are reffering to.  There is a site called (I think) www.surgicaleyes.com that gives a number of horror stories about the end result of messed up lasik.  The only people I have known in person to have had it done all came out fine, with no complications.  But from everything I have read, the problem results when they try to do over -12D. </p><p>And this seems to be the only branch of the medical profession that makes a patient sign a waiver before they operate.  Would this give you a lot of confidence in the procedure?   I bet Doc 1 doesn't make his patients sign a waiver saying they won't/can't sue him if he does something that goes wrong.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Joseph A.</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2003, 11:49</p><p>-23: </p><p>I have done that sort of thing before (re-fitting lenses to new frames). In fact, I had the same predicament as you. You see, a few months ago, I cracked my favourite frames during an altercation with a roof. I was trying to nail a tarp to the roof when my foot became entangled in the tarp, and I slipped and fell in gravel. The plastic frame broke at the lens socket. I tried glue, and I tried soldering, (plastic is messy) but nothing seemed to work. I finally got disgusted and just jammed the lenses into another frame that was nearly the right size. Oh, sure, there was space between the frame and lens here and there, and the PD was too close together, but they worked until I found another pair. There is always a lot of frames at the local Goodwill store, I even found one pair that I could see through, but only out of one lens, go figure. I encourage all of you do do the same as you might just find the frame you've always wanted. </p><p> </p><p>Best of luck to all of you, </p><p> </p><p>---Joe </p><p></p><hr>

I was referring to the "I know 4 high myopes who had LASIK and they all went blind!"-type statements people here sometimes make.

I don't think anyone should rely on those anecdotes when making decisions about medical care.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc 1</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2003, 08:50</p><p>Alan. No, you have not asked a dumb question and dont worry i am not going to take offense to any of your questions. Yes you are right itis LASIK and not lasix as I was typing. It is my mistake.  I think it was also referred toas excimer Laser.  </p><p>     Yes my wife tried contacts long back, but she was never comfortable with them.  She could never wear them for long hours continuously without her eyes getting red and congested.  But still she used towear them on and off for a few hours especially when we used to go out for social functions. A couple of years back she developed very severe pain and itching in her eyes which persisted for quite some time.  Our ophthalmologist told us that if this continues she stood a grave risk of developing a corneal abrasion or at the worst a corneal ulcer. She was also using steroid eye drops frequently since a long time to reduce the inflamation and allow her to wear contacts more frequently, which is against medical advice and can lead to complications. So subsequently there was also evidence of fungal infection. This scared her enough to quit contacts.  We did not want to have another complication as we already had our hands full.  But we still keep looking anything new that comes out . She says that despite all the trouble with contacts her vision was really good with them compared to the best possible (&amp; rather expensive) glasses that she had.  And I noticed that she was whenever she used contacts her confidence wason a different level and she was an altogether different person. </p><p>Though now she is too scared of contacts, I am still new to anything new that comes which her eyes can tolerate well. </p><p>  Well, I am a General surgeon and wife is a Family Physician , but right now she has taken a break from practice to sort out a few problems of which her eyesight is one of them</p><p></p><hr>

Actually I  was surfing the web for any information regarding refractive errors and other visual disturbances, especially people with personal experiences and as to how they cope up with it. ThUs I came across this site and found some of the posts quite interesting and some of you here are quite knowledgeable. Maybe even I got an outlet to share my worries and problems and gain from your experiences  as many of you here suffer from  visual disturbances.  It is a nice place for informal discussion.  You see having a fascination for people with glasses is one thing,  which is one of the reasons why I married my wife ( she used  to and still looks georgeous with glasses) , but when things go beyond a certain point where poor vision starts becoming a disability, that is where myself and my wife are right now.  Thus S4e I am grateful to you for your help and lore for your concern.  I am a doctor  and will definitely take a decision after much deliberation,  and any information from you all is very much welcome.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;19 Sep 2003, 21:57</p><p>Hey Lore - just cut back a little.  I don't care for anything else other than that Doc 1's wife gets the very best, most up to date corrective procedure. I have no connection with any eye care service providers, or no interest in any places that do any form of vision correction.  As Doc 1 says, there is so much information out there that is skewered, or biased, I personally have only been trying to suggest some options - options that based on what research I have done seem to work..</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;19 Sep 2003, 13:55</p><p>Doc 1: Just remember that this too is a very biased site that is going to provide very biased information.  LASIK providers of course want to sell their potential clients on the surgery; many of the people here have a vested interest in scaring people away from eye surgeries for aesthetic reasons, and they too are going to provide very skewed information. </p><p> </p><p>I have no idea where to find unbiased information on eye surgeries.  I'm guessing that there are probably some relatively unbiased opthamology journals that might be places to look.  But, please, do not take what you hear on this site any more seriously than what you hear on web sites promoting laser surgeries or other eye surgeries--in other words, take it all with a huge grain of salt!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;19 Sep 2003, 11:51</p><p>Doc 1 -- I hope you don't take offense to this, but why are you calling it "lasix", rather than the typical "lasik" (which is actually based on a pseudo-acronym)? </p><p> </p><p>On a different note, what specialty are you and your wife in? </p><p> </p><p>Take it easy with her as far as the arguing goes.  Remember *why* you're trying to convince her of things; there is no room in this for losing your temper -- right?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc 1</b>&nbsp;19 Sep 2003, 04:27</p><p>I definitely agree with you S4e &amp; georgina.  that lasix reduces the risk of retinal detachment is utter rubbish,  I dont know who fed her that crap.  But you know this is her state of mind right now,  it is just commonsense and you dont have to be a doctor to know that it is not true.  But this is a fact that doctors are good only at advising other patients ,  and they themselves are the worst patients.  Same is the case here, my wife just cant think straight now.  She is getting paronoid and repeatedly tells me that she is going to go blind, and thus desperately wants to do something to prevent it,  thus she has latched on to lasix which she now feels is the solution.  Now even I am determined to make her see sense, thus we are frequently having heated exchanges with my temper flaringup.  Hope this dosent take a toll on our relationship. </p><p>    U know there is lot of medical literature which is very contradictory,  studies which are of dubious authenticity , many of them influenced by various companies and commercial interests.  Thus leave alone the common man even medical personal get misled or carried away.  LIke I said lately my wife has been scouring all journals and books for information about myupia, lasix etc and I really dont know how much of it is authentic.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2003, 15:50</p><p>Doc 1 -- I apologize for what may be a dumb question, but what about contact lenses for your wife?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2003, 14:22</p><p>Oh, she could still have lasik georgina, but the amount of safe correction would only be about 8 to 10D, leaving her still very nearsighted, and this would be a pretty dangerous thing to do, as far as I am concerned</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>georgina</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2003, 12:33</p><p>Doc 1, </p><p>Your wife can´t have lasik because her numbers are too high. Lens implants may be possible. But refractive surgery does not reduce the risk for retinal detachment.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2003, 12:29</p><p>Doc 1, that is definately at the highr end of myopia.  I assume that she has reasonably good visual actuity still - like 20/30 or therabouts. </p><p> </p><p>To reduce this amount of myopia by lasik would be so very dangerous I wouldn't want to put myself into the hands of any doctor that even suggested they could do it.  Not only is kereconitis a big problem/possibility, the chance of further problems is extremely high. </p><p> </p><p>Why would your wife even think that the chance of retinal problems might be lowered?  If she, as a doctor, thought about it a bit she would realize that there is absolutely no diference in the eyeball length after lasik.  It is the fact that the edges of the retina are stretched thin by the shape of the severely myopic eyeball that causes lattice degeneration, which can develope into a retinal detachment if left untreated.  This also hods true should she decide to go for a lens implant.  She might even be at higher risk if she has any form of surgery done to the eye, as surgery can mean trauma.  I don't want to sound scary, but for your wife, anything she decides to have done with her eyes is dangerous.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc 1</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2003, 11:35</p><p>Hi Susane &amp; Nancy </p><p>  thank you for the posts.  After reading ur posts I feel it is no big deal that my wife is getting bifocals at 30. I think You both are brave ladies who have faced their visual problems boldly and come to terms with it and got on with life. I hope some of it would rubb on my wife also.  But whatever may be fascination towards glasses I would never wish anyone to be visually handicapped or so become so dependent on their spectacles so as to change their whole life style and adapt themselves  as their vision permits. </p><p>  Curt,  you have a pretty low Rx compared to wifes which seems to be multiple of yours.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc 1</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2003, 10:54</p><p>  S4e my wifes Rx is -18.50 -1.25 x120 od and -18.50 -.75 x10 os.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2003, 06:55</p><p>Doc 1: As I said, I got my first bifocals at age 27.  I have always been somewhat farsighted, and I just reached a point there the prescription that gave me clear near vision made my distance vision too blurry.  My first Rx was +0.75 in each eye with a +0.75 add.  I am now 43 and my current prescription is +1.50 in each eye with  -1.0 cylinder in each eye and a +2.0 add.  My Rx has gone up 0.25 to 0.5 D each visit (every other year).  I am actually one of the few people I know that wears progressives and lined bifocals interchangably.  The latest progressives I got (Varilux Panamic) are really great; but there are times when I prefer my lined bifocals (i.e., when I read a lot), and so I have a pair of FT35s also. </p><p> </p><p>I can still get away not wearing my specs for distance (although my vision is not quite clear), but I cannot see anything within arms length anymore! :-( </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc 1</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2003, 05:23</p><p>Hi S4e, and thanks for the link. I am sure it is worth looking into.  My wife will find it helpful. Another thing about Lasix that we have learnt is that in high myopes post surgery in the long term there is a strong possibility of developing keratoconus,  due to excessive shaving of the cornea , thus making it thin &amp; weak. There are studies going on about the long term fallouts and keratoconus is one of them. </p><p>    One more thing that my wife has come to believe is that post Lasix the risk of retinal detachment, which most high myopes are prone to is minimized.  I dont how far it is true,  though I very much doubt it.  Anyway I am going to get it confirmed by another of my ophthalmologist friend , who is not that trigger happy.  If you can shed some light on it then you are welcome.   </p><p>    By the way Curt you had mentioned that you got bifocals at a very young age.  How old are you now and what was your Rx when you first got bifocals and what is it now?  If you can tell us about your progression and stabilization of vision etc it will be helpful. </p><p>   S4e I will give you my wifes exact Rx.  She has it with her and i will get it and post it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Susanne</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2003, 05:21</p><p>Doc 1 - Of course, having a lensectomy as an infant, I have had bifocals all my life.  I do have a sister, 15 who has had them for about 4 years and another sister, 17 who just got them, reluctantly I might add.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nancy</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2003, 05:19</p><p>Andrew: </p><p>Going from a high minus to high plus, the first thing I noticed was the difference in size, things are a lot bigger now. </p><p>Also, I was not prepared for the difference in visual accuity.  I used to be very near 20/20.  It's much less now.  I'm told it would be better if I could wear contacts or had IOLs but both are out of the question. </p><p>Doc 1: </p><p>I've had bifocals since I was 16 and had (still have) a roommate that has had them since she was 12, and did not have as strong a prescription as mine.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2003, 13:53</p><p>If you want to check it out, the website is found at www.artisanlens.com. </p><p>I think that this is a far less invasive procedure than the lasik surgery is.  If your wife's prescription is quite high, lasik might not even be able to fully correct her. </p><p>What is her prescription Doc 1?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc 1</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2003, 11:42</p><p>Hi Curt &amp; S4e, and thank you for your kind suggestions.  I really appreciate them. </p><p>  I totally agree with you curt.  It is true we have associated bifocals with presbyopia &amp; thus old age.  Your post has been a reveleation and I will try to convey ur ideas to my wife, which are very sensible.  Now looking back I agree that lately even I have seen young people with bifocals, a young lady who is my patient also wears them,  and rather confidently. U see the term bifocals, has hit her psychologically, and i understand that. The other day she referring literature on presbyopia,  she is worried that she will have to switch glasses for distance and for near at work, which she feels is going to be </p><p>embrassing. Yesterday she told me that she has seen one of her laboratory technitian who wears bifocals who has to tilt his head at various angles to see clearly.  One of the main reasons for her contemplating lasix is she feels once her distance vision is corrected she can wear glasses only for reading which will be convenient. She has also been fed with the information that the minification which she faces due to strong glasses will no longer be there. Anyway I just hope it is a passing phase and she will get over it soon, but as of now she is obsessed with it. </p><p>   One more new thing I have learnt that lasix may not give full correction in high myopes like her ,  and she may still have to wear glasses for distance, hope she considers this and weighs all options. </p><p>   And curt, regarding her changing the glasses frames so that they fit her tightly,  we have already tried that but the tight frames pressing against her temples were giving her headaches and she was getting depression marks on either side of the nose as her glasses are pretty heavy despite High index. </p><p>  S4e the lens implant u have mentioned is a new thing about which i have heard but dont know about it in detail. It will be helpful if u can shed some light on it.  It might be an option worth considering.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2003, 08:47</p><p>I would not contemplate LASIK after all that I have read, because my eyesight is so good with glasses,   However, I can appreciate that this is not the case for everyone.   At 38, the onset of presbyopia is nearly upon me.   I suspect I shall need reading glasses to wear over my contacts in a few years, and bifocals will probablt follow a few years later.   I would not want to spend a large amount of money just to change my prescription, as you still have most of the inconveniences associated with wearing glasses (fogging up on cold days etc.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2003, 08:39</p><p>Puffin, </p><p> </p><p>According to that logic, people shouldn't wear glasses: they should be happy going through life with whatever vision they develop/were born with.  Glasses aren't "natural" anymore than contacts or laser surgery is, and people who opt for one of the latter are not showing any less acceptance of their vision problems than people who wear glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2003, 06:00</p><p>Well Doc1, this is one of the cases where the need for surgery probably outweighs the potentil problems.  And lets face it.  The problems so far have only occurred in a small percentage of those that were operated on.  Personally however, I would suggest that she go for the artisan phacic lens implant, as to me that seems far safer.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2003, 05:51</p><p>Doc 1:  Having got my first bifocals at age 27, I can understand where your wife is coming from.  But she (and a lot of other people) need to lose the stigma that bifocals are associated with old age!  Bifocals are for convenience - it means that you need a near correction that is different from your distance correction, and that is all.  Young children wear bifocals, teenagers wear bifocals, college students wear bifocals...you get the idea.  We have always learned to associate bifocals with the onset of presbyopia, which typically occurs at age 40-45, which has often been ascribed as the onset of "middle-aged".  But as someone wiser than I once said: "Age is a state of mind".  You are as old as you feel, or as you act. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe your wife should consider a different frame, possibly one with earpieces that fit a little tighter to her head, so that she does not have to wear a chain around her neck for her specs.  And no-line bifocals can replace her single vision lenses and no one but her eye doc will be the wiser.  There are plenty of folks who need vision correction that lead active, happy lives.  There is no reason to let dependence on vision correction change your life.  It will, it you let it... </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2003, 00:43</p><p>It seems that people either can or cannot deal with what life throws at them. If you can, you're lucky. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doc 1</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2003, 22:27</p><p>Hi this is my first post here,  though i have been here quite a few times. </p><p>  I agree with sarah &amp; Lore.  It is one thing to be fascinated and be attracted to  a person wearing strong glasses and totally another thing to be the one wearing them.  I am a doctor and i admit i am attracted to ladies with glasses.  My wife who is also a doctor is a high myope, though i really like the way she looks in glasses,  over the years as her Rx has steadily climbed up, i am witness the problems she faces everyday due to her poor eyesight eventhough glasees give ger a fair amount of correction, vision is not as clear and sharp as before.  She appears to have become less confident and is not her usual vivacious self.  I feel sad to see her struggling to find her glasses early morning &amp; middle of the night, bending down and peering at small things and squinting.  Recently she has also started wearing strings (chain) around her glasses to prevent them from getting knocked off as ithad happened once.It dosent look nice as it makes look old before her age.  She is now very careful where she keeps her things and carefully places her glasses next to her when she sleeps&gt;  Gone are the days when she was a carefree and impulsive person. i dont know how it has happened , but gradually over the years it has set in. </p><p>   To complicate matters,  her ophthalmologist has told her that she has to wear bi-focals as she is unable to see fine print now.  This has depresses her as she is just 30 now. </p><p>   So now we are considering her undergoing Lasix,  and shortly i will be taking her to a specialist. </p><p>    So aliena and S4e it is not only for vanity, it is more to be functional , confident and independent and see he world in a better way </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2003, 16:53</p><p>Just wanted to add that there is no evidence that anyone has *ever* gone blind from LASIK or the other surgery (PKR?), high myope or not.  It's one thing if you want to discourage people from getting the surgery by pointing out the risks of halos or floaters or other visual disturbances that happen after surgery (but that many people still find preferable to needing very strong glasses to see anything).  It is another to spread false information.  There are people who come to this site because they looking for information on high myopia (including information on surgeries) and not because they are into glasses or people who wear them.  It seems unethical to me to spread the lie that LASIK can cause blindness when, AFAIK, there are no documented cases that it has.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2003, 16:49</p><p>I think people are conflating the risks.  There is a miniscule chance of going blind from LASIK, even as a high myope; there is a very good chance of needing reading glasses or of still needing some myopic correction to see at long distances. </p><p> </p><p>For many high myopes, I imagine, needing glasses to read is far preferable to needing glasses to do *anything*.  A high myope cannot see clearly at any distance; someone who needs reading glasses can see clearly until things get near to their eyes.  Most people who need correction after LASIK, whether for myopia or hyperopia, only need mild correction.  Obviously it's not just vanity, or even primarily vanity, if people are willing to wear glasses after surgery.  They just want better eyesight, and LASIK, in most cases, will give it to them, even if it won't give them perfect vision. </p><p> </p><p>I think people are being very unfair to high myopes who choose LASIK, and unjustifably so.  I imagine that if a high myope had, for example, a small child, they might feel more secure knowing that they could go to their child in the middle of the night immediately without having to grope around for their glasses.  That's a situation many high myopes will find themselves in, and vanity has nothing to do with it. </p><p> </p><p>Would I choose LASIK?  Probably not.  If I had the money, maybe, but I certainly wouldn't go into debt to do it.  But, if I did, it wouldn't be for vanity (I like my glasses), but for convenience.  Heck, I like my glasses so much I'd probably hope I needed a mild prescription after the surgery.  But, even with a moderate prescription of -5, I can imagine how much easier things would be if I didn't need any correction (I say this after having knocked my glasses off of my nightstand at 2 am last night and trying to find them under the bed without being able to see and without waking my husband), and that would be the motivating factor.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2003, 16:10</p><p>You get absolutely no argument from me on this one Aliena.  Laser surgery is still in its infancy, and the problems that it might create have not all shown up yet.  In the mid 40's, after WWII in Japan there was a surgical procedure done for eliminating or reducing myopia.   The long term results were that a large percentage of the participants ended up blind.  I doubt that this would happen with the laser surgeries we are now using, but the question I ask anyone who is considering it is: " Do YOU want to take the chance?"  If the answer is yes, and something goes wrong, oh well too bad so sad. </p><p> </p><p>I repeat what I said before.  Of the people I know that have had PRK or laser surgery, ALL of them are wearing reading glasses.  Is this acceptable to them - it seems so. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pinkspecs</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2003, 15:53</p><p>Aliena. </p><p> </p><p>Well said I feel the same as you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aliena</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2003, 15:15</p><p>specs4ever and others: </p><p> </p><p>I have heard of too many cases of lasik surgery gone wrong, especially in high myopes, that I would not take the chance of being blind and would much rather wear my very strong glasses to see.  I think glasses are much less bother and mess than contacts, but of course, I cannot wear contacts.  I can take my glasses off and cannot see, but I can put them on and see reasonably well.  If I have to go to the bath room in the middle of the night, I put my glasses on.  No big deal, no one sees me anyway.  Doing sports is, yes, not so easy, but it can be done and I have done it.  I swim a lot and use Rx swimming goggles and I can see. </p><p> </p><p>In all deference, I think the primary force in wearing contacts and getting lasik surgery is vanity.  The individual does not want to wear their glasses because they think the glasses make them look like nerds or ugly or ...? </p><p> </p><p>I got over that a long time ago, because I wanted to see and glasses was the only way I could.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sarah</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2003, 06:48</p><p>Lore, </p><p> </p><p>That last bit - that most people would prefer a weak minus prescription to a strong one - is true, I'm sure.  I also think the appeal of laser surgery is a lot stronger in people with strong prescriptions who don't wear contacts...after living for years and never seeing the world clearly without glasses on, just the idea of being able to do that seems wonderful.  For these people, contacts aren't an option for some reason (maybe just fear of having to put something in their eyes).  Glasses fogging up or getting misty with rain definitely is a pain, and with a strong prescription, you can't do very well when you take the glasses off.  Strong glasses also distort your vision quite a bit, and there isn't much peripheral vision.  So not needing glasses, or wearing contacts, is just better in terms of how you can see. </p><p>   So I agree that vanity isn't all of it.  But I also think vanity plays a big part.  I often find myself liking someone's glasses, but knowing I couldn't wear similar glasses and have them look the same because my lenses are so strong.  And I sort of wish my glasses were less obtrusive.  I think I'm pretty accustomed to not being able to see when I get up, and being able to find my glasses or my contacts pretty easily.  So for me, I think it is more about vanity, or about the "convenience of vanity" -- I mean, if I want to wear contacts, I look the same as if I weren't nearsighted, but it might be nice not to have to take the time to put the contacts in. </p><p>  Of course, lots of people on this site obviously dislike lasik because it goes against there being girls with strong glasses.  I'm sure their views are influenced a lot by their interest in and desire for such women.  I find I don't have a problem with that, probably because it gives me some positive feeling about myself.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2003, 07:43</p><p>I think there's a lot of underestimating the negative aspects of being really nearsighted.  It's not just about vanity.  Being totally dependent on glasses, which high myopes are, is not fun and not easy.  It's no fun to have to grope for glasses in the middle of the night to get to the bathroom.  It's no fun to have a small child pull glasses off of your face and potential bend them.  It's no fun trying to walk to work in the rain when your glasses are getting wet, and no fun walking into a steamy room and having your glasses fog up so you can't see.  While I'm sure that needing glasses for reading isn't very nice, either, it doesn't seem quite as drastic, since you can still see at most distances.  High myopes can *only* see at distances very close to their face. </p><p> </p><p>I just don't understand why people find the appeal of LASIK so unfathomable.  It's not about vanity, I imagine, for most high myopes, but convenience.  And, in terms of convenience, having a -5 is still far better than having a -15, in terms of how well you can get around without glasses, and having a -2 is certainly much better than a -12.  It's not, I imagine, about not wanting to wear thick glasses or wishing one could wear thinner glasses, but about wanting to be less totally dependent on glasses.   </p><p> </p><p>Again, until you have tried to exercise or play a sport with glasses getting foggy and sweaty and sliding down, or tried to find your glasses on an unfamiliar nightstand to get to the bathroom in an unfamiliar house, or put your glasses down to get dressed and been unable to find them for quite a while, you really can't say that people get LASIK because they don't want to wear thick glasses for vain reasons.  If I were significantly more myopic than I am now (probably above a -8 or so), I'd definitely look into it, and I *like* glasses.  But if it got to the point where I literally could not function at all without glasses or contacts, I'd want to do whatever I could to improve the situation, and vanity would have nothing to do with it.  I imagine that, for many people, the idea of having uncorrected vision in the -1 or -2 or -3 range (even if their corrected vision is only 20/30 or 20/40) is preferable to having uncorrected vision in the -8, -9, or -10 range (even if their corrected vision is 20/20), for reasons of convenience.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2003, 20:15</p><p>S4E </p><p> </p><p>That would be my objective.  I currently wear perscribed GOC at -7, but would love ot be in the -9 to -10 range.  If I need lens replacement, I expect to as both of my parents did, I plan to try and convice the Dr. to make me a myope in that range.  Hope it works.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2003, 13:56</p><p>Guido, you can easily tell your doctor that you want to remain myopic when you have the lens replacements for cataracts.  The only problem with that is that when they take out your own lens you do loose any form of accommodation that you did have.  Although, I am finding that at my age, my accommodation is practically non existant anyway, so I would love to be -4 with progressive bifocals, and just be able to dispense with glasses for reading. </p><p>One online friend of mine had his lenses replaced, and is a -9D myope now. That might be a bit harder to convince a doctor to do.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guido</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2003, 10:25</p><p>specs4ever,  I echo your desire.  I have the beginnings of cataracts, and there is no doubt in my mind that I would opt for replacement lenses that would put me in the minus range.  I've spent my whole life knowing that if I got close enough to something I could see/ read it. I'm a minus 6 give or take and I would want something that would give unaided vision down to about 6-10 inches. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2003, 09:30</p><p>However, I suppose that it might be very tempting for a -15D myope to have part of their vision corrected so that they could wear a -5D prescription. It is unfortunate that the stigma against wearing glasses has been so ingrained over the years that people are willing to go to any length to get rid of them. And, for many many people who have had lasik, the short term results are quite good.  But, every person I know who has had lasik seems to be busy searching for their reading glasses.  Personally I read so much I would love to have a -3 or -4D in both eyes, and I would gladly wear glasses for distance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aliena</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2003, 08:14</p><p>specs4ever: </p><p> </p><p>Oh yes, I agree.  Good conscientious Drs will not do lasik surgery on high myopes.  I think they draw the line around -10D.  It is because of the retinal detachment thing and the necessity of having to remove such a large amount of the cornea to bring the vision into a point that much weaker glasses are needed.  The long term effects of removing part of the cornea are not known.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2003, 20:40</p><p>I also think Aliena that the same is true of a very high myope having lasik surgery.   I think that the lens implant would be by far the better choice of the two.  But of course as you say, wearing the thick glasses that a high myope needs to wear to see would be far preferable to having an operation that went wrong</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aliena</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2003, 13:52</p><p>Yes, Netzhautabloesung, is a the German word for detached retina.  The eye is a highly organized, a very self-contained organ and the retina is a very vital specialized part of the eye that absorbs the optical photons of the images received and transfers the images to the brain.  In high myopes, the retinals are almost invariably stretched thinner than in normal eyes and are usually delicate.  Puting foreign objects, such as a lens implant, even though it is in the front of the eye, just under the cornea, it can cause a chain of reactions in this delicate eye and give one of the most sensitive parts, the retina, changes so that it detaches. </p><p> </p><p>Detached retinas can be repaired by laser surgery these days, but the result is never as good as it was before the detachment and sometimes the damage is so bad that only very marginal vision is possible and it is much worse than the case of being a high myope with strong, thick glasses that are needed to see.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2003, 17:54</p><p>Hi Sarah. Well, I think that the reason that it isn't being marketed as much as laser surgery is that there is less than 10% of the population with myopia higher than -6D.   Also, until recently it has been undergoing FDA trials for the last 5 years.  I am posting a link for the artisan lens that might interest you.   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731005509/http://www.healthyeye.co.za/artisan.html" target="_blank">http://www.healthyeye.co.za/artisan.html</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sarah</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2003, 15:20</p><p>I haven't really heard about that much.  Is it being done (in the US) yet?  Is there a reason it seems to be a lot less marketed than lasik? </p><p> </p><p>I have no idea when my vision will stop changing, so I don't expect to be having any procedure like this done anytime soon.  But I wonder if I'll pursue it if it becomes an option.  I like the "idea" of not being blind without my glasses or contacts, but wearing contacts really isn't a big deal for me, and I almost kind of like wearing glasses.  I feel funny saying that, since "everyone" (it seems...except people on this site) thinks glasses like mine are ugly or at least weird looking.  But it seems like the glasses keep getting better just as fast as the surgery options keep coming out.   </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2003, 09:30</p><p>Sarah, the newest procedure for high myopia is the lens implants.  These implants are placed in the eye, right in front of the iris - I believe. These are better than the lens replacements that are done for cataracts.  This is not as invasive a procedure as having lasik done. There is only a small slit made to inset the lens, rather than having the largest part of the cornea opened up and for my money would be the way to go.  It is fairly important to be sure that your myopia progression has stopped.  The nice thing about the implants is that they can be removed, or replaced with implants of a different power should your vision change.  I think the procedure is more expensive then laser surgery right now, but I like the idea of it better.  Whatever you do though, just don't forget that you are a high myope, as anything that you do to your eyes has a chance to induce retinal detachment.  As well, once you have any form of surgery, your eyeballs still have the myopic elongation and retinal detachment will always be a danger. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sarah</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2003, 08:10</p><p>Do they sometimes use lens implants to treat high myopia, instead of laser surgery?  When do they do that?  (I mean, when are the implants considered better than laser-ing?)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2003, 17:41</p><p>Thanks for these details and advice, Nancy and Suzanne. </p><p> </p><p>Nancy, how do you get along with your +10'. It would have been a bigger change for you than someone going from a low Rx. Do you wear glasses now or CL?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Susanne</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2003, 11:32</p><p>Lentifan: </p><p>Don't be in a big hurry to get + lenticulars.  I don't know of many people with them whose vision is 20/20.  They also limit peripheral vision and you have to look right through the centers, you can't scan your eyes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nancy</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2003, 05:47</p><p>Lentifan: </p><p>I had been about a -19 to -20 myope before cataract removal.  I wound up with +10's after.

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2003, 06:01</p><p>On the subject of cataract removal, I too have wondered whether, if I ever got cataracts, it would be an opportunity, by refusing to have the implants, to get a reasonable plus prescription. </p><p>I think I read somewhere that the average post-cataract Rx is about +11d. I am -2d to -3d at the moment, so does that mean I would probably end up with +8 to +9d?   But then I think I remember a contributor to this site, Nancy who had been a minus in the high teens, tell us that after cataract removal she was +9d or similar.  If you are reading, Nancy, best regards and please let me know if I got that wrong. </p><p>Anyone know how to induce cataracts......?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2003, 04:16</p><p> </p><p>Brille, </p><p> </p><p>Glad to hear that you enjoyed your day out in your -18s.  Generally, I won't do it where I live (San Francisco Bay Area) since the obvious questions that one's hobby would elicit from those friends you might happen to bump into would prove troublesome.  This potential difficulty could be especially acute when "caught" wearing obviously strong glasses such as mine or myodiscs such as David's.  Query to David Llewellyn:  Do you freely wear your myodiscs out and about where you live?  Any interesting reactions when you do?  Most people, I have found,  aren't all that observant and wouldn't know a -18 from a -8, unless, of course, the frame was too large and the lenses uncommonly thick.  I always go for the most "normal" look which means minimization of the lense thickness wherever possible, although I do know that some hobbyists enjoy extreme lens thickness in and of itself.  (Incidentally, an optician might get suspicious if a customer pushed for the thickest look possible since the vast majority of people want the thinnest look reasonably available.) </p><p> </p><p>As far as coming clean with your optical dispenser, I suppose it wouldn't matter if you did, although they naturally might hesitate to fill out a prescription which didn't originate with a legitimate OD or MD.  I think David Llewellyn was on track when he said that money is king, especially with a business.  An optical store is first and foremost in the business of making a profit and an order is an order.  I have never had any optician check my doctored prescription with the issuing OD and rarely have they asked any nosey questions.  I think most people working in an optical store realize that some people with super high prescriptions might be senstiive to too much chatter and too many intrusive questions.  However, I find that a moderate amount of conversation that I initiate and control can be rather enjoyable. It rather sexes up the entire experience.  Frankly, it doesn't take much to show your knowledge of the subject, especially if you have been following the information on this site for any length of time. </p><p> </p><p>Keep doing the GOC.  It is always fun to notice those passers-by who notice one's unusual prescription.  When I was doing it recently in NYC I got cruised shamelessly by a good-looking man in Chelsea.  I'm not bad looking myself, but I just know from personal experience that he was totally turned-on by the -24s.  (Incidentally, the -24s are in a 1.7 glass which gives decidedly better visual clarity than my old -24s that are in high-index plastic. The old ones  were purchased at LensCrafters in Boston and were a huge problem from the very start.  A story for another time and a reminder of the limitations of chain stores.) </p><p> </p><p>Cheers for now. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brille</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2003, 01:14</p><p>Fritz, David_Llewellyn, Tortoise </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for the feedback. I think it is best to be open and talk about GOC. The other option which I am considering is just to walk in to any optician with an extreme Rx and see if they will fabricate. I just think with such an Rx it will only be natural for the optician to be intrigued to know my eye health history and start to ask many questions. I don't think I would have the confidence in this situation. Anyway, I enjoyed wearing my -18's for GOC yesterday trying to find small and independant opticians - window shopping if you like.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Trent</b>&nbsp;07 Sep 2003, 17:14</p><p>Catamount, </p><p>I have also wondered this same thing myself.  Two of my myopic relatives, one from each side of the family, had the cataract operation and both came out with near perfect vision.  Maybe someone else from our group with direct experience could comment.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Catamount</b>&nbsp;07 Sep 2003, 15:00</p><p>Wondering if some of you have ever run into this situation.  A close friend of mine with a -9.25 prescription in both eyes was diagnosed with cataracts and was told that surgery is necessary in a few months.  What they didn't really discuss with him was that the lens implants he would receive would not only replace his own natural lenses but would correct his myopia.  For him this was okay, but what if my friend had insisted that he wanted to retain his current total dependence on visual correction, or even would like to take the opportunity to rachet his prescription up a bit if his wishes would be honored by the ophthalmologist.  Has anyone ever experienced this?  I don't have cataracts but if I get them, I certainly would want the choice to continue to wear glasses that at least correct my current myopia.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tortoise</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2003, 08:54</p><p>David_Llewellyn... I've been finding your recent posts very informative and interesting.... thanks.  </p><p>Some of the things you have mentioned suggest to me another way that the eyedoc might be persuaded to prescribe for GOC.  </p><p> </p><p>Given the doctor's commitment to deliver the best vision care possible to the patient, and, given the patient's determination to do GOC with or without the doctor's approval or assistance, surely any responsible vision care pofessional would see it as more ethical to supervise the whole thing rather than to leave the patient to his own devices. </p><p> </p><p>I also think it may prove less expensive in the long run to pay for professional help from the start rather than experimenting with hit-or-miss Rx combinations. </p><p> </p><p>For me it is just a matter of getting past the embarrassment factor.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David_Llewellyn</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2003, 21:07</p><p>Hello! Brille: I am open with my eye doctor who is the important person. He writes the Rx, gets the contact lenses, and determines the spectacle Rx by measurement... doing it yourself by calculation I believe is an inferior method. Measurement at high powers is not perfect either; I think the main problem is that the doctor has trouble getting the vertex distance correct. I find that when a pair of high-power minus glasses is made, I must push them a little too close to my eyes for comfort to see well, i.e., they're slightly underpowered. I will correct for this the next time. But I think calculation is even more risky. </p><p>I generally don't talk to opticians about it, I just bring them the doctor's Rx and they do the rest. And yes there is excitement (well, it's quite sexy actually!) to go to the shop, take off those contact lenses (my natural Rx that is) which the optician thinks I wear full time and now must no longer wear, and instead get these nice myodiscs. Naturally you have to sneak the GOC lenses on. I do that (obviously) in the bathroom, then wander out into the shop basically blind. </p><p>It's definitely way convenient to let the doctor know. Years ago I described the basic approach I used, but I'll do so again. I already had the doctor for a couple of years (before I even thought of "GOC", 20 years ago, but I termed it "Rx synthesis", 'cause I could make any Rx I wanted!!!!). I asked the doc "do you ever get requests from people to change their eye colors with contact lenses, who have no Rx and therefore no medical justification for contact lens wear?" He said yes, that as long as the patient exhibits maturity and understanding about the risks of CL wear and can take care of them properly and comes in for exams like any other patient, he had no problem doing that. At that point I had him! He had just said he would prescribe unneeded CLs for vanity. Why not unneeded CLs with an Rx, so I could satisfy my vanity by wearing stronger glasses, plus glasses, etc? He looked quite surprised, said he'd never thought of such a thing, but he'd heard of GOC for 1. reading glasses over contacts of any type Rx; 2. glasses over contacts of the same direction to split very high powers b/w glasses and contacts so neither are very high. </p><p>Now, I think one key thing is that at the time this optometrist was fairly young. Young doctors need $$$. You have $$$ (or forget it!!!). The worst thing that can happen is the doctor says no and you get (very slightly I hope) embarassed. Doctors are very conservative and never a day goes by when they don't worry about getting sued. So of course an eye doctor might worry that you 1. are setting him up for a lawsuit; 2. will NOT take care of the lenses, have trouble, and sue (but remember, since he'll prescribe zero-Rx colored lenses, he's taking that legal risk anyway!). So it's a good idea to have a relationship with the doctor, the longer the better, ideally starting when he's just out of school and DESPERATELY needs $$$ to pay off medical school loans! After all, an optics obsessive is not just a slight nut to the doctor. An OO is someone who is fascinated by the doctor's OWN CHOSEN FIELD, rare amongst patients! An OO is someone who buys many contact lenses and many pairs of glasses! Life is good! So go out there and get your eye doctor involved in your hobby. Remember that doctors do not have necessarily an "ideal" human form in mind, and any desire to get medicine to change AWAY from that is to be rejected. Much medical care, in fact a lot of the big money, is in "cosmetic" surgery, orthodontics not necessary for function, etc. So don't worry about telling your doctor. I don't think he or she will be as shocked as many of you out there fret about. </p><p>With the eye doctor in the loop, you will have no worry about crap like are you using the right base curve CL, or the right type of CL, etc. YOu will be getting professional medical care so the risk to you will be minimized. </p><p>I relatively rarely buy the glasses thru the doctor, which is about the most expensive way to get glasses. The doctor has no more control over what the lab does than you do or even the optical shop. Once your job gets to the lab, some half-wit moron will probably stare at it for six weeks or so before giving it to the one old guy who actually knows how to make something more difficult than just bugging the right Rx with his mouse. So there is little reason to spend lots of extra $$ (except to reward your eye doctor!) for spex. But I recommend using him for the Rx and at least getting some CLs thru him. You of course can order duplicate CLs over the internet or whereever once you know they work for you. </p><p> </p><p>johnnyb555: I got them from my eye doctor. I think they were called Alden Classics. He says they're available from -50 D to + 50 D. Cool! IN my power a +50 CL would probably produce a -80 or -90 Rx (just a guess, but given that a +30 produces a -52....). They are soft lenses with a blue tint. They are pretty comfortable. </p><p> </p><p>Go Forth and GOC! May the legions of the Myodisc'd and Lenticular'd conquer all before them, and relegate Lasik to a procedure used to increase Rx!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2003, 15:07</p><p>Brille, </p><p> </p><p>No, I have never come clean with any optical store or optometrist. In fact, my interest isn't one I would divulge to a therapist, even if I had one.  Funny enough, it wouldn't be hard to discuss any other type of fetish with a mental health professional, be it leather or whatever; however, being an OO just seems to be too far out there.  Besides it is fun to go through the entire process of ordering super strong glasses and finally going into the store for the pickup and fitting.  A bit of a rush, really. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fritz</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2003, 05:08</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Very interesting information re blended myodiscs provided by David Llewellyn.  In San Francisco I have found an optical shop that specializes in all lense types and heavily discounted frames.  Unlike the chain optical houses, they actually understand and supply lense products such as Zeiss 1.9s.  Naturally, these products are expensive, but I bought -24s in 1.7 for $125.00 and they came out quite nicely.  They're biconcave with the edge thickness lopped off and polished.  A bit of a myodisc effect. The store's owner encouraged me to go for a blended myodisc the next time I went in. </p><p> </p><p>Incidentally, a qustion was asked about high plus lenses.  Baush &amp; Lomb does make a high plus contact lense called Silsoft.  They start at +12 and progress up to +32 (wow!) Needless to say, they are expensive even for the serious hobbyist. The last time I looked I believe they were $144.97 US for one lense only.  Much less expensive are the Cooper Vision Hydrosoft Spheres which can be procured in a +20 and are around $35.00 US per lense.  There are any number of Canadian internet lense retailers; however, the one that I have used without any problem has been LensExpressions.com.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David_Llewellyn</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2003, 13:00</p><p>Hello! Original Tony: These myos are for GOC. I have a natural -9 Rx. To get to -34 or thereabouts I use a pair of +20 contacts. I also have +25s for the -42 glasses, and +30s for the -52 pair. I also have -20 contacts which allow me to wear a +12. It is far harder for me to wear the +12 than the -52 pair! (probably because I'm used to minus powers). </p><p>Brille: Your assumption is not correct. I do not buy Rx glasses as a general rule over the Internet. First, most sites won't allow you to enter very high powers (-20/+12 is usually the limit). These sites are usually not interested in very high powers, just like the major optical chains aren't. Too much work and risk for them for little additional $$$$. I do buy usually empty frames from ebay. </p><p>Speaking of which, I am a big fan of the Flexon Autoflex 5 frame. I have two pairs which have broken temples (due probably to taking lots of falls in Aikido in them). One of them has unusual lenses: my natural Rx in a +5.00 base curve (usual is 0 to 1). If anybody out there has any of these frames available for sale, I'd be interested. Size/color don't matter as my main intent is to replace the temples on the ones I have. They have of course been discontinued by the manufacturer so that they went from 2 round frames (they also discontinued the model 12), 40 ovals and 50 rectangles to zero rounds, 40 ovals and 52 rectangles. That's style for you!! (Forgive my frequent grousing!!!!) </p><p>More about internet shopping: There is some risk. I found that even my -9 Rx was, when I did order Rx glasses via internet, were not all that well made. The same problem is true in optical shops, but at least it's easy to turn them down upon dispensing. When you get them by mail you'll have to repack them, return them, etc. For low powers it's probably fine, but even -9 is strong enuf that it has to be pretty good.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David_Llewellyn</b>&nbsp;03 Sep 2003, 16:39</p><p>Hello!!! I've been away from this forum for many centuries! Those who remember me might recall that I have a great interest in GOC, myodiscs, etc. I read the last 2 years' postings, and I'd like to mention/answer a few things (sorry that it's been sooooo long!!!) </p><p>Blended Myodiscs: These are available from one company, younger optics (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731005509/http://www.youngeroptics.com)./" target="_blank">http://www.youngeroptics.com).</a> Their page on myos is difficult to find: </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731005509/http://www.youngeroptics.com/products/core/cmyo.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.youngeroptics.com/products/core/cmyo.shtml</a> </p><p>This is a table of various powers and curvatures available. Note that the lowest power is -8 for the bowl. </p><p>The big advantage of this product is that it is incredibly easy for the lab to use it. The "base curve" here refers to the pre-formed back bowl power. The lab simply grinds whatever remains on the front, so this is always a biconcave lens (unless your power is PRECISELY that of one of the available back powers). For example, my -34D pair uses the -24 product; the front has a -10 power. So all the lab had to do was grind a -10!!! </p><p>This product is available with both a plus and a minus carrier, altho I've never seen a lab choose the minus carrier for any job I submitted (or on anyone else's face for that matter!). The plus carrier has, outside the bowl on the back, a +6.25 curve. The minus carrier has a -2.00 curve. So the plus carrier lens will indeed get thinner on the edge with a larger frame, PROVIDED that the power ground on the front is less than -6.25. However, the lens will get heavier with larger frames, so opticians will invariably recommend a small frame. </p><p>I have heard from several opticians that these lenses are no longer available, but I do not know if this be true. Younger does not update its web site much (a couple years ago I submitted to them several errors I found and they've never corrected them). For "moderate" powers (-20s, -30s) the trend now is to biconcave lenses. The assumption is that you will use a very tiny frame anyway, and this will reduce edge thickness. The other available option is to have a lab custom-grind lenses. This is required over -35 or so (Younger says theirs is good only to -30, but my -34 glasses say otherwise!). These will normally be done in a double-myodisc type format, with equivalent sized bowls on both sides, but more of the power on the back. THe problem with the double bowls is that both sides, as in any biconcave lens, act as minifiers; so thru, say, a 30mm back bowl a 30 mm front bowl might appear only 20mm wide or so. I have also a pair of -52D done this way, in some high-index material. They are amazingly thin, tho somewhat heavy. The bowl size on both sides is 20mm, but the apparent front bowl size as viewed thru the back is only 17mm. There is enuf distortion around the edge that there is only probably 12mm of useful optical zone therein. </p><p>Someone earlier mentioned that with high powers you can specify a CR-39 lens and they will use high-index anyway. This is very true and sometimes extremely irritating. However, the upshot is if your power is over -18, say, you would BE A MAJOR FOOL if you wanted and paid for a high-index lens. Almost certainly the lab will choose a high-index material REGARDLESS of what you actually paid for. Why? Because it's way easier for the lab! The higher the index the less deep the cuts required, the less chance for screwing up, the easier to mount in the frame, etc. Suppose, however, the lab for some reason chose CR-39 as you requested. My GUESS is most would remake it in high-index for the difference in price. So you can't lose (except some time) and you are very likely to win. </p><p>I ordered a pair of -42.50 D glasses.... get this ... from Sears (as in Roebuck!!!). It took 5 weeks, as they had to job it out, but it only cost about $250 (I supplied my own frame, since I don't like rectangles and that's all optical shops carry now). I specified CR-39 because I wanted of course the thickest lenses possible (well, within reason!) Of course they came back in high-index. This was easy to verify with a lens clock (which you can often pick up on ebay for $35 - I highly recommend it for any OOs!!!). THis showed a -15 on each side, when in CR-39 it would have shown, well nothing because the clock can't measure past -20 and each side should have been -21 or so. The lenses were well-made however. Very thin at the edge, at the edge of the 30mm bowls about 10mm. </p><p>I am interested in the complaints about blended myodiscs. With the edges unpolished, I find that everything "outside of the bowl" is completely blocked off (grayed out), so there is no tendency for the eyes to stray there. (unless you use a tiny frame). Vision is surprisingly good in -34. I also have unblended ones, which are much thicker for some reason. Vision is about equivalent. Older double-myodiscs in the same Rx are MUCH harder to see out of, despite larger bowls (40 as opposed to 36mm). Again the double bowls cause the front bowl to have a much smaller apparent diameter. While vision blurs towards the bowl edge, it would even in unblended myos or regular lenses anyway at about the same angular displacement. One key in myodisc wear is to bring the lens close to the eye. With mine the lenses (20mm outside thickness) just about touch my face. Any further away and the bowl will appear very small and the image extremely tiny and distant. </p><p>You should figure on much of the space in front of your eye, inside the orbit, being filled with the lens. </p><p>If you have a very high Rx, -30 or so, and you are not (or can no longer get) these Younger Optics blended myos (i.e, they're being custom made for you.. check out Sears!!!), consider asking for a smaller bowl. You will have to get the Doctor to write it on the Rx, labs will ALWAYS ignore customer requests unless they are doctor's requirements. The standard blended myos have either 36 or 40 mm bowls, depending on Rx. I think a lot of this space is wasted. 27 mm would probably be totally adequate and provide a much thinner and lighter lens... if that's what you want!!!! </p><p>Now that's a lot of stuff for a re-introduction message!!! Hope you're all having fun. And of course, don't believe everything you read!!!! - David L.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BKOM</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2003, 06:48</p><p>Hey there everyone. </p><p> </p><p>This is my first post to this forum and website, maybe not my last. </p><p> </p><p>I haven't had a chance to read everything on here yet, but this seems like a weird and wonderful place. Ive been lurking for a couple weeks. </p><p> </p><p>I can tell you that I've had fairly strong prescription glasses for myopia since I was a little kid. I was probably 3.5 or 4 years old when I got my first pair. I grew up on a farm and about that age, I was outside with my dad when I got scared and lost and couldn't find him, although he was only a short distance (say, 100 feet) away. This resulted in a trip to the eye doctor and a pair of thick, heavy plastic frame glasses. This was in 1977, or thereabouts. </p><p> </p><p>I have no idea how strong they were at that time, but my rx continued to get stronger as I grew up through adolescence and adulthood. I'm 30 now, and I wear glasses with an rx of -12.50 on the right and -11.75 on the left. I'm not sure what the other rx numbers you folks are posting mean, or what my corresponding numbers would be, though. I'll have to check on that. I haven't gone to the eye doctor in at least three years, so I probably need to go back, anyway. </p><p> </p><p>You can see a picture of me in my current glasses here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731005509/http://www.greasylake.org/circuit/images/bkom.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.greasylake.org/circuit/images/bkom.jpg</a>  if you're intersted. </p><p> </p><p>I've known this level of myopia to be kind of abnormal for some time, but I've never given it much thought until recently. I started poking around on the Internet a bit and landed here. I never knew to what degree my nearsightedness was unusual, or not, but this website has given me some perspective, i.e. kind of strong rx, but not too bad, considering. </p><p> </p><p>I DO have a love for women in glasses, for sure, and look forward to checking out some of the links and whatnot. </p><p> </p><p>I just got a new pair of rx Ray Ban sunglasses that have the thinnest lenses I've gotten in years. I'm not sure how they did it, exactly, but they look awesome. Much better and thinner than any of the other high-index plastic lenses Ive every bought. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, I just wanted to say hey and express how much Ive been enjoying this site. </p><p> </p><p>Cheers, </p><p> </p><p>BKOM </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hearty</b>&nbsp;15 May 2003, 01:51</p><p>Ooh, one more thing before I totally crash here...it's 4:30a.m....in answer to, do I like men in strong glasses. I thought maybe I'd posted this moment somewhere here, but maybe not. It was last summer, August, and I'd come down with Lymes Disease. I was in the hospital waiting room, sprawled out on a very hard chair, burning up with fever, and feeling extremely ill....and being made to wait hours, as we do here in CT. I hear some people milling in, and when I look up, my eyes can't believe what i'm seeing. It was a youngish (20 som.) man, very tall and slim, and wearing roundish, gold metal myodisc glasses, the first I'd ever seen! He was dressed ruggedly but kinda cool, and it seemed he wanted to draw attention to the glasses (or else they cost so much he didn't want to lose them) because he had a red, fairly wide, sports strap attatched to them, and hanging partly down his neck in back. He had short hair, well anyway, being sick as I was, I had no strength to pretend I wasn't extremely attracted. A couple of times I did try and turn away, but he'd already caught on that I was very pleased at his appearance. I mean his eyes looked quite shocking (but to me of course, beautiful)  </p><p>I tried to look at him without zooming right into those small circles, but it was impossible. There isn't much else to tell, we just did some kind of strange and awkward mating ritual, while trying to pretend we weren't. He kept sitting down and standing up and I switched from flirty smiles to disinterested looks....I remember being so happy that i had done my hair the night before, and that I'd worn some pretty leggings, having been in bed and all.  </p><p>I tried in vain, to think of some way I might convey to him that I was into glasses, in case he was an OO, but I couldn't think of anything. When they called my name to go in, he stood up and watched me walk away...he whistled a low whistle, and I turned my head back and gave him a sultry glance....and then I collapsed on the table, wondering if I was going to die, yet with a huge smile on my face..</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hearty</b>&nbsp;15 May 2003, 01:25</p><p>Wow! This is thee greatest thread!! I wish I had more time to read everything, I've just gotten up to summer, 2002. I have a couple of questions/comments. </p><p>First of all, are lenticular lenses the equivalent of myodiscs? And if a lens base is thick enough to be scooped out so, how can the sides be thinner, are they filed down? An 'old-timer' should know this, but.... </p><p>I'm just soooo getting off on these stories, Hamil and his sister, etc...I love to read about progression. I also FINALLY took the time to peek into your website, Puffin, and enjoyed the pics....while I'm not gay, I do like to see beautiful people and that means glasses, too! About those extreme myodiscs on your site....the other fellow's glasses you posted....are they like, real? And if so, ,who made them? </p><p>Sorry if I pour out a year and a half's worth of posting all at once, but I decided to just stay up all night and read some of this. Only now, am I able to get back into all this. </p><p>Be still my 'Pinging' heart, Jey, great glasses, as always!!! Oh gosh, what else?? Someone asked me if I also like men in strong glasses, Oh yes, the stronger the better! To walk down the street with a cool looking dude, with an extreme rx, would make me feel so proud!  </p><p>You guys are so cool and funny and wonderful!! OH, one more question! If the eye only varries 4D from close to infnity (wait I must have read that wrong, as people are corrected more then 4D's!) Well anyway, if I have a -1 distance (I went down .25) =( then is there a minimum + I can only go up to, for close work? Questions.... </p><p>Good morning!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2003, 17:54</p><p>Alan </p><p>The glasses that I generally wear if going out are bronze coloured metal frames with rather small lenses with +13/+15.There is no size written on them but the lenses measure 51 x 35mm.I have no reading add in them so at home or work I have another pair of plastic frames with my full script in them.These ones have 55-13 written on them.I assume this refers to lens size.I also need dark glasses when outside because of sun magnification but they have no size on them either.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ukoo</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2003, 06:14</p><p>Always wanted GOC but have come up with an interesting alternative.Have an RX of approx +6.5. Got minus 15 biconcave in CR39 inserted in my frames. Then refitted one of the original  PLUS lenses. Now one really tiny eye behind A VERY very thick lens and one very large eye very magnified. The combined effect is  quite awesome.                             The effect of the high minus lens just blanks my vision totally in that eye, but I can see perfectly through my right eye.This is great as I can slip them on and off whenever I want when I am out of town.

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2003, 09:35</p><p>Jaymac, </p><p>How long did it take to get to your present prescription? Mine peaked at about age thirty at -17.50 and has now slowly backed off to -16. With my glasses I see 20/20 and with contacts I can get to 20/15. Also what is your corrected visual acuity? My prescription seems to be on the borderline between where high index leaves off and lenticulars begin, my 1.6 high index are biconcave and about 1cm thick but I find it hard to come up with a good pair of lenticulars (myodiscs)these days. When I had the -17.50's they were non-blended myodiscs that were very thin at the edges with 30mm bowls. I would like to find these again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jaymac</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2003, 02:54</p><p>Puffin, </p><p> </p><p>The thought of you or anybody else swallowing lenses creates a great mental picture!! Perhaps there may be some mileage in the idea; even as a means of seeing clearly from parts of the body other than the eyes.

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2003, 14:59</p><p>Jaymac </p><p> </p><p>I've had a bit of time to swallow those lenses of yours... doesn't anyone say things like "oh my, don't they look strange glasses?" and would it not be worth a little extra thickness for a wider bowl size, or are you really comfortable with what seems to me really small bowls?  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jaymac</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2003, 02:45</p><p>Alan, </p><p> </p><p>1.9 index will currently cost a little over one third more than 1.8. This doesn't sound much, but, as a pair of 1.8 lenses in the -40 range will set you back some $500, the increase is quite significant. Personally, I don't think it is worth it. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2003, 17:49</p><p>Jaymac - I've heard of 1.9 index lenses -- do you think they're a lot more expensive than the 1.8 index ones?  I haven't heard much about how prices for lenses go up as the index of the material goes up from 1.67. </p><p> </p><p>-42 D and only 7 mm thick -- that's pretty amazing.  It all fits together: index and bowl size.  Still amazing though.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jaymac</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2003, 02:41</p><p>Alan, </p><p>     In the case of the "Myodisc" type lenses the maximum thickness is 12mm. Obviously, this does not occur at the edges, as the concave part of the lens is ground on the surface of a reversed plano-convex. The blended lenses are more or less flat, except for the small concave centre area, and the average thickness is 7mm. As you say, these lenses are relatively thin for their power, due in no small way to the "Tital" glass, which has a refractive index of about 1.8, No doubt the glasses would appear much more impressive if they were made as bi-concave full aperture, but one would need a reinforced nose to hold them up! </p><p>I believe that glass with r/i of 1.9 is available, but at great cost; also the increased color fringing may not be appealing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jaymac</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2003, 02:14</p><p>Daffy, </p><p> </p><p>      The quickest way to answer your question is to go into your nearest optical store and ask them. Most have a handy little program on their computers which deals with just such requests. Otherwise, it can be calculated , but one would need to know it the lenses were plano-concave or negative meniscus. </p><p>Also, in the latter case, what the front and back surface powers are.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Daffy</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2003, 14:25</p><p>Sorry for posting this here as well. </p><p>A question I hope someone here can answer...How much thinner (at the edge) would a 1.67 high index lens be if it were compared to a 1.5 index lens? They are both the same diameter (75mm) and an Rx of -5.25. Thanx in advance. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jaymac</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2003, 12:05</p><p>AJ, </p><p>   Thanks for your reply. I too can see no reason to have a low powered lenticular, other than to reduce the edge thickness. Obviously, the lower the power the wider the effective aperture can be, so the visual field would not be as restricted as ours. In the industrial and scientific optical field we quite often use a lenticular type of construction for both positive and negative plastic lenses, as the clear margins can be employed for mounting purposes; but that is far from our interests in eye wear. </p><p> </p><p>I am due an examination next month, but at the moment I don't feel that there will be much increase, if any. Without glasses my focus point lies approx. 25mm. in front of my eyes, though it is somewhat difficult to measure accurately.This distance is proportionately less with the -45D lens than with the -42D, but the figure above is about the average.How much higher I can go with useful vision is yet to be discovered, but, as I think I said in a previous posting, spec. lenses are made to over -50D, so I may yet have room to manoeuvre.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2003, 07:52</p><p>Jaymac: </p><p> </p><p>I was aware that "myodisc" lens was not the medical term.  Many Drs call them lenticular lenses, meaning double lenses, and that is the term used in Europe and probably many other places as well.  I don't have any idea why the name, myodisc, developed and what it means.  Maybe it was developed by opticans and not ophthmalogists.  I have studied some about different eye disorders, high myopia in particular, and their correction with various types of lenses and other optical aids.  My Drs have helped me obtain information when they found out that I was interested.  But, like Puffin, I had not heard that lenticular lenses were used for prescriptions less than -18D or so, primarily because of the decreased visual field.  Why would someone have a lenticular lens for a -6D correction or even a -10D correction? </p><p> </p><p>Jaymac, maybe someone has already asked you this, but can you see anything without your glasses when you hold things very close to your eye(s) or are you too far into the woods?  </p><p> </p><p>So, you expect to have an examination soon.  Are you having some trouble seeing with your very strong glasses? How much more of an increase can they give you?  Maybe telescopics are next for you? Your minification factor must already be quite significant. </p><p> </p><p>Aliena</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2003, 04:29</p><p>Jaymac: </p><p> </p><p>I am somewhat surprised at the mention of myodisks at -6. Surely there cannot be much difference in thickness between a regular -6 lens and a myodisk one? </p><p> </p><p>I always thought the tradeoff between the strange way myodisks look and the increased thinness (!) was only worthwhile over -12. </p><p> </p><p>Then I suppose if you are mad keen on them, why not?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jaymac</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2003, 03:46</p><p>AJ </p><p> </p><p>I guess that most of us who wear very high minus lenses take an interest in the lenses themselves; especially maybe in their design and appearance. </p><p> </p><p>If you feel the urge to dig deeper, I can recommend a book entitled "The Principles of Opthalmic Lenses" by  M. Jalie. The last reprint of the latest edition (the 4th.)was in 1997. It was published in London (England) by The Association of British Dispensing Opticians. If you are still curious, Amazon.com might be able to find a copy.  </p><p>To understand it fully a fairly good knowledge of mathematics is needed, but lots of the information contained within the 500+ pages is of a more general nature </p><p>By profession I am an optical engineering  consultant (NOT opthalmic) and I've found this book a very useful source of formulae. </p><p>As you might expect the word "Myodisc" does not appear anywhere, as it is a tradename for a version of the lenticular lens. (The term "lenticular" is more accurate, but does not roll off the tounge as easily as Myodisc. The notion that lenticular lenses are not available in powers of less than -20D is not correct. The actual starting figure probably depends on the manufacturer, but at least one maker will provide them from -6D up. </p><p> </p><p>I seem to have rambled on a bit, so congratulations if you have read this far!! </p><p>I always look forward to your contributions.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2003, 14:05</p><p>pete: </p><p> </p><p>I don't think the frame and the lenses are so big.  A 25 mm center lens, which is what I measure, is just about in the center of the 45 × 40 mm lens.  I think that this is pretty standard for a myodisc lens, as the optician said that the innder lens is more difficult to scoop out and grind when the carriers are smaller, e.g., 35 × 30 mm, and you have to also consider the astigmatism correction of -5D in the center lens, which they usually put entirely on the front of the lens.  But, I do have the smaller lenses too, of 35 × 30 mm with a 20 mm center lens.  It is just that the center lens is reduced by 5 mm in diameter. </p><p> </p><p>I will take Dianna's reoccurring adventures with her high myopia into the development of more stories.  Right now, I am working on another story that could develop into multiple stories with multiple characters.  But, thanks for the suggestions. </p><p> </p><p>Aliena</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>pete</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2003, 12:01</p><p>AJ </p><p> </p><p>Based on your description of Dianna, have you ever thought about developing her into a central reoccurring character for other stories?  She's got unique qualities, some extra sensory abilities, a companion (the dog not the prince), a frequent flyer in the space/time continuum and a severe, very apparent weakness with a nice hook - the flaw is quite appealing to readers and characters alike . </p><p> </p><p>Why do your Docs recommend such a large frame if only 20-25 mil is usable?  Also, still wondering what the cut - in is like.  Can you see the edge of your face and hair line in the lens? </p><p> </p><p>Pn:  You are well on your way.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2003, 09:14</p><p>pete: </p><p> </p><p>Yes, the plus carrier is thicker in the center, where the viewing lens is ground out.  The lens edge at the central lens would be relatively thick when it is of a smaller diameter.  The small diameter would give a small viewing area.  Myodisc lens wearers anyway have to move their head and not their eyes to focus through the myodisc central lens so as to keep their vision in the center of the lens.  That is one of the things that takes a little time to get used to in wearing myodisc lenses.  If you move your eyes toward the edge of the lens, things become less clear and if you go beyond the lens edge, everything disappears.  </p><p>My estimate of the size of my eyes was just that, an estimate, but I don't think that it could be twice 3-4 mm, or 6-8 mm either. </p><p>Personal note:  sage advice, but not always easy to accomplish.  It takes some of us time and patience and maybe age!  </p><p> </p><p>Alan: </p><p>People that are blind or near blind, like I am without my glasses and  Jaymac and others too, often compensate by having their other senses develop more acutely, such as hearing, feeling, smelling, and even I think, maybe some ESP.  That is what I was trying to develop for Dianna.  But, she also had her dog that I portrayed as helping her.  So yes, I was trying to characterize Dianna as having become particularly adept in her surroundings and her circumstances.  And, I did have her characterized as often sitting quietly and listening to things going on around her. </p><p> </p><p>Without glasses throughout my life, there would be many things that I could not do because of my poor eyesight.  But, because they have been able to give me glasses that help me to see a lot of things, I can do most everything that is normal.  There are some things that even with my glasses are not possible.  But, without glasses, life would be much harder for me; however I think that I would adapt to get along, even though I could only see very blurred colors and blobs. </p><p> </p><p>I tried to portray Dianna as identifying things by smell: perfume, flowers, food, fish and many more things.  She could run her fingers over things and identify wood, metal, cement, plaster, cloth, water, sand, etc. by feeling them, sometimes even with her bare feet.  And even identify cabinets and drawers because of the little knobs, a chair, a table, etc.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2003, 15:05</p><p>I don't want to sound pompous but I don't write my stories specifically for comments, they are nice because that means someone's read them and (hopefully) enjoyed them.

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2003, 14:16</p><p>AJ - I also read your story and liked it.  I rarely comment on stories, partly because it seems like it creates a nuisance: if everyone who reads a story comments on it, then the story is soon buried on a thread beneath a mountain of comments.  But I guess I should also think about the author's desire to know what people think about their stories.  Anyway, good job -- I hope you'll write again. </p><p> </p><p>Question regarding your story (since you're in a position to evaluate this, perhaps unlike other authors): It seemed like Dianna was able to sort of get along - without giving the impression that she was completely blind, yet her prescription ended up being close to -20.  You've said that you were pretty much blind (w/o correction) when your Rx was -20.  Did you mean to characterize Dianna as particularly adept at coping with her very minimal vision, or was there another idea at work here?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>pete</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2003, 13:26</p><p>AJ </p><p> </p><p>I think I'm confused with how the plus carrier and myodisc lens relate.  Doesn't the plus get thicker towards it's center where the bowl is scooped out?  Would that make the lens edge in a smaller (as opposed to larger) frame thicker?   </p><p> </p><p>I'm certainly not in a position to dispute your estimation of 3 to 4 mil (between 1/8th and 3/16th of an inch), but that's smaller than I would have imagined.  There must also be a fair amount of cut-in? What's that like? </p><p> </p><p>[On a personal note:]  Try not to take anything personally.  Nothing that others do (or don't do) is because of you. We constantly project our own issues onto one another.  Better to let it roll-off rather than have it sink-in . . .

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2003, 11:37</p><p>pete: </p><p> </p><p>Apparently, I was composing while you were composing too.  Yes, the stories are buoyed by a few comments and then they sink into oblivion, with people sometimes reading them without comment.  I do take things too personally sometimes. </p><p> </p><p>About the size of the lenses and frames: I just like small lenses and frames.  I think that they are the most attractive and big lenses and frames look clunky.  I have a regular face that is probably small and big glasses just over power my face.  But, I think that is true for most people.  But, for me, it is especially so, because the lenses would be very thick for a large sized lens and frame.  My lenses have to be a certain minimum size to accommodate a sufficiently sized central lens for the myodiscs.  This size is usually 20-25 mm diameter central lens with the overall lens being 30-35 mm (this would be a small lens).  My lenses are usually a little larger about 45 mm horizontal and 40 mm vertical for the overall size as recommended by my Drs and optician. </p><p> </p><p>They can make the central lens quite small.  I have seen glasses with a central lens of only 10 mm diameter. These usually look very unusual because of the small viewing area. The small size is used for very high powered lenses to keep the overall size of the lens in proper proportion.  This makes a small field of view, but they tell me that people that need the very high powered lenses manage with the very samll central lens. </p><p> </p><p>I cannot really remember how many pairs of glasses that I have had, but I would estimate 40-50.  Right now I have 7 pairs: a regular monovision pair with glass lenses (40-45mm) that I wear most of the time; a back-up monovision pair with plastic lenses (30-35mm) that I wear mostly in the evening but are with me all of the time; a pair with the full distance Rx for both eyes with plastic lenses (30-35 mm) that I wear once in a while; a pair of monovision sun glasses with plastic lenses that are a bit bigger than the others; a pair of swimming goggles with my approximate Rx; the telescopic glasses; and then the clip-on magnifers.  I have not always had so many pairs of glasses as this.  In the past, it was only 2 or 3.  The 3 coming when I got the swimming glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I cannot really tell you how small my eyes look behind my glasses.  But, everyone tells me that they look very small.  When I look in the mirror, the lenses are usually reflecting light and it is difficult to see my eyes.  My estimate in looking in the mirror would be a few millimeters (3-4mm)in diameter if I have my nose very close to the mirror.  When they dialate my eyes, they look bigger.  But, I really don't know how accurate all of this is.</p><p></p><hr>

My Rx then was about -20D and I couldn't see anything clearly without them.  Everything was (is) a complete blur with only patches of color and vague solids.  I would have had trouble walking down the hall of the school and I couldn't even have found the door into the school without help.  It is not any different now, even though my Rx is much stronger.  I was blind then and now without my glasses.  Without glasses and special optical aids, I would be considered a blind person.</p><p></p><hr>

Unlike other threads, stories are briefly buoyed by a few comments then sink like stones.  I also have a story making the decent into darkness.  I don't think it's a reflection on the story quality and shouldn't be taken personally.  It's just the norm way of responding to Art: view; absorb; feel/reflect and move on.  Hats off to those who make the effort to post a note! </p><p> </p><p>About your glasses preference:  Could you explain your criteria for choosing small lenses and small frames?  What are the factors that would make them too small or not small enough?  How many pairs of glasses have you had?   </p><p> </p><p>Oh, and AJ:  I'm dying of curiosity:  How small are your eyes seen through the lenses?

<p><b>Gus</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2003, 20:17</p><p>AJ - Glad to hear you got your glasses back and that you had another pair with you.

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2003, 12:26</p><p>I read the story too and liked it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2003, 11:55</p><p>Oh yes, pete:  Another thing. </p><p>So, you did read the story, "Dianna of Klingdon".  Since I didn't receive very many comments, I thought most people did not read it or didn't like it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2003, 10:04</p><p>pete </p><p>On further thought, glasses with thick, unusual lenses could also be an attraction for many people.  By unusual, I mean biconcave and/or myodisc lenses.  Even the high and unusual reflections of the lenses could be attractive for some people.  Maybe even, the inability to see the person's eyes very well, could be intriguing and then the urge (facination) to see the person's eyes and face without their glasses might occur.  I think that these are the things that might make the wearing of very strong glasses an attraction (fetish, maybe?) or as you say "eye candy".  In thinking further about this, I believe that the guy I dated that wanted me to take my glasses off frequently was in this category, as he never tried to take my glasses away from me or was he mean to me in any way.  I think he was intrigued by my wearing very strong glasses and just wanted to see me without them once in a while, perhaps squinting my eyes to try and see, which is a natural tendancy for me to do, even though I can't see anything much doing it.  I think, as you said, he actually liked me and being with me. </p><p> </p><p>My preference in glasses is to have small lenses as possible and a small frame as thin as possible.  For me, this usually means nonplastic, wire frames. </p><p> </p><p>Someone asked if anyone had ever taken my glasses from me.  It did happen once when I was 12 and first started to wear myodiscs.  They prescribed regular glasses too that had very thick lenses (about 1") but they told me to wear the myodiscs as much as possible to get used to them.  I think it was the second or third day of school and I was wearing my myodiscs.  I had just entered the school yard and a boy came around from my back and grabbed my glasses from my face.  I didn't really see who it was as everything was immediately blurred.  I panicked and started to cry a little.  I then remembered that I had the regular back up pair with me and I put them on.  After a little while, the boy came to me with my myodiscs and gave them back to me and said that I shouldn't cry.  He said that someone had dared him to take them from me and he just wanted to try them on and see what he could see though them.  Eventually, we became friends. </p><p> </p><p>Yes, the clip-on magnifers are fixed focus.  The telescopic glasses have adjustable focus to some extent.  I sometimes use them when riding in the car or a train to see out the window better.  I also have a little monocular telescope that I can put up to my distance lens to see small things like bus numbers, signs, etc that are too small or blurred to read.  I now almost always carry it with me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>pete</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2003, 08:17</p><p>AJ </p><p> </p><p>Tonight I'll be attending a gathering and perhaps seeing for a second time an attractive (happily married) woman who wears glasses with biconcave lenses.  Upon first meeting we talked for quite some time. I've never thought to consider all that (naturally) goes into social dynamics but would agree eye contact is important. In our case paramount (looking into her eyes was, for me, eye candy).  I would agree, too, that eyeglass style has a lot to do with either being a barrier or an invitation, her's being quite small, just bordering the eyes therefore very little of her face being affected by the strong lenses. Maybe it's my personal preference:  I'm very fond of thick glasses but don't like being distracted by them.  </p><p> </p><p>Also, I'm glad to know your magnifiers restore depth perception.  I imagine they're fixed focus?  Does your theater pair have adjustable focus?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2003, 18:36</p><p>pete, </p><p>I have thought about your comment that some might find glasses, especially ones with thick lenses, confrontational, a barrier in front of the person.  I think that this might be so, and the individual then might be difficult to get to know and understand as you cannot really see them the way they really are.  Because my myodisc lenses have to be biconcave, they have high reflection from the front surface and because of the high minification, my eyes are hard to see.  That probably is confrontational to many people as you cannot see me very well, at least my face and eyes.  I know that glasses can really change the way a person looks, especially one with thick lenses, but also the type of frames -- size, color, style, etc. can change a person's appearance.  This undoubtedly could make interpersonal relationships difficult and/or slow to develop.  I just have never thought about it before. </p><p> </p><p>Yako: </p><p>My magnifers are such that they restore binocular vision for close up and I can read and see the computer screen with both eyes at the same time.  They also restore depth perception.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yako</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2003, 09:19</p><p>AJ </p><p>As you normaly use monovision, is your magnifier designed to restore binociular vision, i.e. different lenses for each eye, or is it also mono? </p><p>Yako</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>pete</b>&nbsp;21 Feb 2003, 08:07</p><p>Maybe this guy in question simply liked AJ even if she wore thick glasses.  Though some of us find strong glasses appealing there are others who may find them confrontational - a barrier in front of the person behind them.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gus</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2003, 23:05</p><p>AJ - Interesting situation with that guy you dated who constantly wanted you to take off your glasses. You may want to be careful about guys like him. People like that might be sizing you up, trying to see if you have a weakness that could be easily exploited. If someone really wanted to take advantage of you, they might take away your glasses, knowing that you would be helpless without them. Has anyone ever taken away your glasses? If not, how do you think you might react if someone did take them from you.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2003, 18:25</p><p>Jaymac: </p><p>Thanks for your answer.  You are like me and have been wearing glasses all of your life and were born very nearsighted, having glasses at 5 mos.  I probably needed mine sooner than 1 yr of age too.  A couple more questions if possible: how long have you been wearing your present Rx of -42 &amp; -45?  Your wife's Rx is very close to mine.  Did she also get her first glasses at a very early age too and does she also use clip-on magnifers for reading, computer, and other close work? </p><p> </p><p>pete: </p><p> </p><p>I don't really have a preference for boy friends that wear or do not wear glasses.  As it turns out, however, most of the guys that dated me wore glasses and/or contacts.  Maybe, they felt comfortable with me because I wore glasses with a high Rx.  I think that people that wear glasses, especially those of us that need a high correction, are probably attracted to each other.  Although none of the guys that wore glasses had a Rx as high as mine or even close to it.  There is probably a certain mutual sympathy of knowing that your date or significant other cannot see anything without their glasses.  One guy that I dated a couple of years ago did not wear glasses and he was quite intrigued about what I could see or not see without my glasses.  He frequently wanted me to take my glasses off, but I didn't do it too often as I am blind without them.  A couple of times I took my glasses off while dancing with him as I was having trouble seeing anyway, as the dance floor was fairly dark.  This seemed to really interest him.  He kept telling me what pretty eyes I had, etc. etc.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2003, 03:07</p><p>-14 </p><p>Thanks for you support.I have already noticed some minification with my specs especially reading.The way my rx has been increasing I will be -14 by the time I get out of college.Although my left eye is 20/20,doc has not been able to bring up my left eye more than 20/25.My younger brother (12) has -minus six now and can see 20/15 in both eyes.I guess I am the one in my family with weak eyes..</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2003, 17:35</p><p>Hi pete, </p><p>I don't remember if you asked the questions before or not.  I can see pretty well intermediate distances (5-7 ft) with both eyes if things are not too small.  My distance vision for my RE with the -27D correction is practically nothing, very blurred.  It is pretty blurred with my full distance correction (-32D) too.  Close vision with my LE is difficult because of the minification of the -30 lens and with the poor accommodation that I have.  I have a lot of the myopia in my lenses and the muscles can't focus the lenses very well, if at all.  I can't really read for any length of time with my RE either and not at all with my LE, hence the use of the magnifers that really help a lot.  And, yes, I have very poor depth perception, practically nothing, but this is primarily for close distances less than 3 ft.  I really don't notice differences in the minification for the two lenses that much as I use only one eye at a time most of the time and the differences between -30 and -27 may not be that great. </p><p>My Rx increases have slowed down a lot, but my Drs think that I could still have some increases. </p><p>I just received one acceptance to Grad School and I am waiting on two others, one of them my first choice.  I expect to hear by the end of this month. </p><p>Aliena</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2003, 17:20</p><p>Brian- </p><p> </p><p>Don't worry about double digit RX and getting your drivers license. it seems that your vision is good with correction so a few more diopters shouldn't make much difference. although there is some minification (nothing like Jaymac and his -40) my vision with glasses is excellent. No problem passing the eye test. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>pete</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2003, 15:28</p><p>AJ </p><p> </p><p>Did I ask you this before (apologies if I did):  Because each of your eyes is corrected for a different 'use' isn't only one eye able to see an object clearly?  Is your perception of depth affected? Do different amounts of minification have an adverse affect when you look at things with both eyes?   </p><p> </p><p>Also, are your Rx increases over? </p><p> </p><p>BTW:  What's the word on Grad Schools? </p><p> </p><p>pete</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jaymac</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2003, 12:15</p><p>AJ, </p><p>   Thanks for the info about your Rx. As you can imagine I am not able to drive; I would need at least four more lines on the eye chart. My wife cannot drive either as she is also a high myope, -30.00 and -28.00, though her acuity is better than mine, due no doubt to her lower powered lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2003, 07:37</p><p>Jaymac: </p><p>Although not nearly as high as yours, I too require a high minus Rx.  LE, -30D sph, -5D cyl; RE -27D sph, -5D cyl.  I have 20/70 in LE and can't see much of anything in the distance with my RE.  The full distance correction for my RE would be -32D, but it only gives me 20/150 acuity, and I wasn't using it much at all.  So, the Drs have prescribed monovision glasses for me and I wear them most of the time.  My RE is corrected for intermediate and close.  Intermediate and close things are pretty small for my LE.  I also have clip-on magnifers for reading, writing, and studying because of the minification of the high negative lenses.  I can understand that the minification with your correction must be very severe.  Do you remember how old you were when you got your first glasses?  I was 1 yo.  I am now 22.  I think that I got new glasses and Rx almost every year and sometimes twice in a year, maybe even once, three times in a year. </p><p> </p><p>Tony:  I am sure that Jaymac doesn't drive with his acuity.  I certainly could not drive with mine.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2003, 06:09</p><p>Jaymac:- Thanks for the info. Are you able to drive?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jaymac</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2003, 04:07</p><p>Tony, </p><p> </p><p>A binocular magnifier is, in effect, a pair of plus lenses whose power is goverened by the degree of magnification required. They can be mounted on a wire frame which clips on to the specs., or they can be fixed to a headband, or even, I guess, in a hand-held frame, though this would not be very convenient in use. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jaymac</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2003, 04:00</p><p>Brian, </p><p>  Re your question about my acuity with my glasses:- </p><p> </p><p>Combined value (using both eyes) is 20/100, though  the left eye on its own ( the -45.00 lens) is about 20/150. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Edd</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2003, 14:10</p><p>Jaymac- The time that you've lost your glasses must have been frustrating to say the least. Any of those experiences stick out in particular?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2003, 13:27</p><p>Jaymac-When I was 6 my rx was around -2.0 or so,and I had two rx increases in one year and actually went up 1.50 another time after that.I am sure by the time I graduate high school (I am 16 now) I will be up around -11 or so.I guess I am looking at bi-focals next time around.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jaymac</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2003, 12:56</p><p>Tony, </p><p>      I use a binocular magnifier for reading,and for the computer, as the minifying effect of my lenses is so great.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2002, 14:41</p><p>Mattp- </p><p> </p><p>i think jey ping's -16s have polished edges but the -17s do not.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stan</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2002, 14:20</p><p>Interesting. I've always been of the opinion that edge polishing de-emphasizes the concentric rings. One time an optician polished the edges without being asked, and I brought them home and wet-sanded them to "unpolish" them. I do agree that the jewel appearance looks nice. I have a pair of small -7s with ppolished edges and the jewel effect is outstanding.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2002, 19:50</p><p>Mattp - no, I don't think Jay Ping's glasses have polished edges.  Looks like a 'flat' finish to me.  I'm a big fan of polished edges -- makes the lenses look more jewel-like and high-tech to me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mattp</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2002, 08:23</p><p>I'm new to this website, so I'm a little "behind."

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2002, 19:19</p><p>LikeGlass: </p><p>I know that myodisc is the term generally used for the double lens that has the viewing lens in the center of a carrier that is usually a positive lens from which the negative lens has been ground.  But, the things you list on the URL that you posted certainly were not medical manuals. </p><p> </p><p>I have been wearing myodiscs (negative lenticulars) myself for about 10 years after my Rx reached -20D.

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2002, 15:09</p><p>No need for a debate! "lenticular lens" is the proper term, and I doubt you will ever find "Myodisc" in any medical manual. Trade slang is just that, slang. Ex- In the lighting industry, we would call 1000watt par lamps "bug burners", because that is what they did! Don't think you'll find that term in any stage lighting handbook either ;) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2002, 14:00</p><p>LikeGlass: </p><p>I don't mean to debate with you, but I have tried to find "myodiscs" in two places: Dorland's Medical Dictionary (1960) and Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (1990). Myodisc was not listed in either place, although "lenticular lens" was listed. </p><p>Both mention lenticular lens as a double lens with a plano-concave or biconcave central lens for high myopia or a convex-concavo central lens for aphakia. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2002, 16:48</p><p>err.... AJ, the article is not one of mine, but the term Myodisc is Trade-slang, not a tradename, as far as I know. Just a term that is easyer to roll off the toung then their proper name. Can't recall when I first heard the term, but I suspect it has been around for a long time (maybe 100 years, who knows) but has grown in use to describe any lens where a standard blank of any Rx, is domed out to produce a sub-lens of very high negitive Rx power. </p><p></p><hr>

Are other carriers available and what are the advantages of one over another?  Also, I understand the difference between blended and non blended myodiscs but in terms of appearance is one more pleasing to look at than another, for that matter how do the different carriers rate in this regard?

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2002, 07:21</p><p>LikeGlass: </p><p>when you say that Myodisc, a tradename, has been around for a long time, what do you mean?  1990's, 1980's, 1970's, 1960's, 1950's, 1920's, 1900's?  A long time is pretty vague.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2002, 15:35</p><p>here's a neat little page that explains about lenses- </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731005509/http://www.nucsys.com/glasses.html" target="_blank">http://www.nucsys.com/glasses.html</a> </p><p>(I've posted this one before) As for the names, both are correct. Myodiscs have been around for a long time and the name is just trade slang. Many now are made out of a flat slab of plastic with no Rx around the outside that has a dome carved into the center. The advantage has always been getting, that is, getting such a high Rx lens to fit in conventional frames.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2002, 14:11</p><p>Yes, Curt, that is true now in North America.  But, originally, a myodisc lens was called a negative lenticular lens, even in North America.  I don't know when the term myodisc came into use, but it was after they had been called lenticular lenses.  I know people that indeed were wearing myodisc lenses that they called lenticular lenses, and even now they are often called that in Europe.  I don't know about the UK, but certainly on the Continent.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2002, 13:12</p><p>AJ: Actually, I believe myodisc is the term used to describe a lens like that with a minus prescription, while lenticular is used to describe that type of lens with a plus prescription.  The design is silimar - a carrier lens with a high strength lens in the center. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2002, 13:03</p><p>Tony: </p><p>Not so.  Myodiscs or sometimes they were called lenticulars, before myodiscs was the term used for lenses that had a negative Rx scooped out of a high positive lens.  The Rx usually started at about -17D or -18D for myodisc, but they could be made in regualr CR39 lens blanks.  To be sure, the regular lenses at this Rx were quite thick (15 to 20 mm) on the edges, but nevertheless were capable of giving fairly good vision in spite of being quite thick.  There was no peripherial vision, but with eyes that require this high of a correction, peripherial vision is pretty nonexistent anyways. </p><p>I know, been there.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2002, 12:01</p><p>NerdKing. </p><p>I am not an expert but I understand that myodiscs are needed at -20d. </p><p> </p><p>It seems that before high index lenses came in to being myodiscs were needed at about -10.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NerdKing</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2002, 18:41</p><p>Tony: The lenses don't cut in my face normally, only when I smile real big.  Maybe someone here on ES can tell me if the next logical progression will be myodiscs :)  Never had a situation where I lost my glasses, don't carry a spare set, but I usually have a pair of spare contacts in my bookbag (small, so worth the effort)  I went swimming without my glasses when I was younger, and had a much weaker prescription.  They actually beveled a lot off the edges of the -17s to allow the temples to mostly fold down - just barely enough to squeeze into a glasses case.  Rather nice of them to think of that.   </p><p> </p><p>Ed: The -16s were from Walmart, the -17s were from Lenscrafters.  Walmart did a bad job - the first pair of polycarbonates had the wrong PD, and even the current ones are sketchy - the -17s from Lenscrafters offer excellent vision - it was worth the extra money.   </p><p> </p><p>-10: Yeah, plastic has significant weight, but obviously glass is a lot heavier.  The temples on the -16s actually fold all the way down - they were designed very well in that respect to accomodate for thick lenses.   </p><p> </p><p>RL: I have no idea what the base curve is, I'm guessing that since about 20% of the thickness is in the front, a -3 or 4 base curve makes sense?  Can anyone else figure it out from those pictures?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NerdKing</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2002, 08:34</p><p>jo: If you want me to tell you how I got such a prescription increase, email me.  I actually had some sort of a progression, wore the -13s around for a while and then the -16s, but some people noticed the thickness of the -13s but didn't find it unusual.  See, I think that for everyone other than the optic obsessives here, there isn't much of a difference in most people's minds between thick glasses and very thick glasses - they don't realize how unusual it is to go from 12mm thick glasses to 16mm biconcave glasses.   </p><p> </p><p>Tony: I can see fairly well with the -13s, but since they aren't my prescription not so well in the dark at all.

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;14 Jul 2002, 19:03</p><p>Marvin, </p><p>   Squinting could just be a habit for your friend -- do you know whether she 'needs' to squint in order to see things clearly?  It's also possible that the prescription wasn't done very well; I think that with astigmatism it is possible to come up with a prescription that seems good in the exam room but doesn't work so well afterward.  (Shouldn't happen, but I think it does sometimes.)  Less likely, I think, is that she has irregular astigmatism or some other eye condition that keeps her from having great acuity.  I don't know if this is something you can talk freely with her about, but could she see all the lines on the eye chart?   </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2002, 16:55</p><p>Here, in Europe, myodiscs (they are called lenti in EU) are produced and sold both made of glass and plastic. There are also blended myodiscs. These have the two parts processed the way that the transition between the inner and the outer part cannot be seen. There  is a kind of smooth transition instead of sharp edge. The reason why myodiscs are produced is, that this shape makes the lenses possible to be thinner at the outer edge and lighter. </p><p>All the lenses you saw in my breifcase are  - 20 D.</p><p></p><hr>

Since I don't drive I have one worry out of the way. As for grocery shopping I hadn't even thought of that. This will be intersting. If anyone has any advise, I'm all eyes. Right now, what I do when I am wearing glasses(always at home somewhere between taking my contacts out for the night and falling asleep) and am confronted with very small print is simply lift up my glasses and bring the small print directly to my left eye. Not sure if I can do this with produce... </p><p>As for my professional life, I admit my choice to conceal as much of my vision problem as possible does in part come from self-consciousness. My back up glasses are very thick with a very visible bi-focal line. I feel terribly blind wearing them, and frankley it is not something that I want to deal with while working with patients. </p><p>And no, I don't do eye exams. I'm a psychiatrist, not an opthomologist. These are two entirley different areas of specialization. I am embarrassed to admit how little I know about opthomology despite my medical training and own experiences. </p><p>Anyway, I will check back in if I have more questions or when my glasses come in. </p><p>Hillary</p><p></p><hr>

I find the -1.00 from my regular with another minus in the lower part of a regular bifocal, for the desk work is good for me.

<p><b>Bill Mac</b>&nbsp;25 May 2002, 06:06</p><p>Tommy, </p><p>I tried some progressives that we reduced a bit in the top.  At my high rx switching glasses can freak my eye muscles out, it seems.

This is the distance between your pupils.  This becomes very important at high rx so the glasses are made with the correct optical center.  When you converge to read, this distance becomes less.  That is why at the bottom of your bifocals, the optical center is inset. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;23 May 2002, 19:37</p><p>-18 </p><p> </p><p>My mother says that when I got my first glasses, I didn't want to take them off.  My CVA now for distance is 20/70 and I think the minification factor is a significant contributor.  I did try contacts a couple of times.  The first time was when I was 13.  I had lots of problems.  I had trouble inserting them as I couldn't see them.  The longest wearing time I got to was about 5 hrs, then they would start to bother me big time.  Another big problem I had was loosing them.  For no apparent reason, one would pop off, and being as nearsighted as I am, I had great trouble finding them -- usually I didn't.  Eventually, I just couldn't tolerate them -- bother and fuss and eye irritation did it.  The next time was when I was 18.  The same sort of problems.  In addition, I have allergies, and I seemed to be allergic to the material in the contacts.  So, it has been glasses most of the time. The Drs don't know about my progression.  They think that I have slowed down and hope that I may be finished, at least with big increases. </p><p></p><hr>

I used to see a girl in a library some years ago with such glasses - I wanted to ask her out but could never make eye contact with her. Surely reduced peripheral vision is a high price to pay for cosmetics ie thinner lenses, or is the weight of normal lenses a problem? </p><p>Hilary - i hope you let us know what you think to your new specs and how they are received by workmates and patients.

<p><b>Sam</b>&nbsp;23 May 2002, 10:03</p><p>AJ, </p><p>I'm surprised your lenses are as thick as 18mm if they are myodiscs. My regular lenses (not myodiscs but normal lenses in normal CR39 plastic) are -22 and they are 'only' about 10-12mm thick. I have the same prescription in myodiscs and they are far thinner than that (I just prefer seeing more out of the regular lenses, and at -22 they can just about make them, but I guess you've got no option at -30). </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;23 May 2002, 08:21</p><p>-18: </p><p>My Rx when I first started to wear myodiscs was -20D for distance and -17D for near and intermediate.  It is now -30D for distance and -27D for intermediate and I have significant astigmatism.  To see small things (print), I must hold them quite close to my -27D lens.  My lenses are glass and 15 to 18mm thick in a relatively small frame.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-18</b>&nbsp;23 May 2002, 07:35</p><p>AJ </p><p> </p><p>What was your RX when you first got myodiscs and what is your RX now? I have regular high index bifocals with my -18 RX and they are not really that thick (12mm). The frames are small so that helps. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;22 May 2002, 20:57</p><p>Additional comments to Hillary: </p><p> </p><p>Yes, unfortunately, your vision with glasses will probably be less than with your contacts.  This is because of the minification effects that high Rxs have with glasses.  Contacts being right on the eye have much less minification effects.  The minification is just a consequence of having very high myopia and needing a very high Rx.  It might take you some time to adjust.  You will have to work at it and have a positive attitude.  Sometimes, I think it would be better to never have started to wear the contacts as it almost always happens that some time they have to be abandoned and it is often difficult to accept and adjust.  But, you are a doctor and should know about such things and further why should you really care how thick or different looking your glasses are to your patients, if you can see?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;22 May 2002, 19:56</p><p>Alan, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for your information on the distance question.  Clears up the matter of why the contact Rx differs from the glasses Rx.  The glasses distance would seem to depend on the Rx combined with the actual distance of the lenses from the eye.     </p><p> </p><p>Wonder why my Dr's. Rx form has preprinted "Vertex Distance 13.75" with a ( ) for a mark and mine that I have for past several years is always checked for that?  Would seem that this might vary from person to person and also depending on the Rx, as you mentioned, so why preprinted on the form? </p><p> </p><p>Tommy</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;22 May 2002, 18:02</p><p>RL: </p><p>Don't go to any of the chain opticians.  The best way to get regular myodiscs is to go to an optical shop associated with an ophthalmologist or medical clinic.  Tell them exactly what you want and don't let them give you anything else.  Insist on it.  If necessary have your doctor tell them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>RL</b>&nbsp;22 May 2002, 17:02</p><p>AJ, </p><p>I have been trying to get non-blended myodiscs in my prescription (-12 R, -16 L) for some time. It seems that all they want to give you is the blended kind which have the distortion. Any suggestions for finding the non-blended myos?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;22 May 2002, 14:26</p><p>Hillary: What you are describing are what is called blended myodisc lenses.  You have really settled for a big package, myodiscs with bifocals.  The blend, which does eliminate a definite bowl appearance to the part of the lens that you must see out of.  I am 21 and I have been wearing myodisc lenses for about 10 years.  The difference between blended and regular myodiscs is that blended will have a lot of distortion and only a little useful vision toward the edge of where the bowl should be.  With regular myodiscs, beyond the edge of the bowl, everything just disappears and you quickly learn not to look there.  With myodiscs, you see the best out of the center of the bowl.  Mostly, you have to move your head instead of your eyes to see.  I also need bifocal correction because of my very high Rx, but I was told that in my case, bifocals would be very difficult to make and use in a myodisc.  Because of this, my Drs have given me what is called "monovision glasses" in which one eye is corrected for close (intermediate) and the other eye for distance.  For extended reading and studying, I use clip-on magnifying glasses.  With both blended and regular myodiscs, peripheral vision is in effect zero.  It is something you have to get used to, otherwise you need glasses with very thick lenses, until they cannot make your Rx in regular lenses anymore.  When I first got myodisc glasses, I also got glasses with regular lenses, which were quite thick.  I was told to wear the myodisc glasses as much as possible, which I did.  I would guess that your Rx is somewhere between -18D and -20D, maybe more because of the detachment. You have been very lucky to have been able to wear contacts for such a long time.  Glasses are not so bad, especially when you absolutely need them to see.  Needless to say that I am also very nearsighted and have been wearing glasses since I was very young.  Good luck to you in adapting to your new glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;22 May 2002, 09:41</p><p>Hillary, </p><p>    What's your prescription?   </p><p>    There are some people here who have experience with these, so hopefully they'll give you some first-hand recommendations.  From what I've heard, they may take a little getting used to, but you should probably be fine.  Your field of vision will be small -- much less peripheral vision than you're used to now.  People can generally get used to this, though.  From glasses I've seen, I'd recommend (not that you can use any advice like this right now) getting frames with a very small eyesize.   </p><p>    Did your doctor explain the 'corneal exhaustion' very much?  I have sort of heard of this, but don't know much about it.  I was wondering if you knew how it works.  Is it from the 'rubbing' of the contact, or from oxygen depletion, or something else?  I'm guessing you wear rigid contacts -- is that true?  Or are yours soft? </p><p> </p><p>Take care, </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;22 May 2002, 09:34</p><p>Tommy and Bill Mac - </p><p>   Vertex distance, I believe, is the distance the glasses sit from your eyes.  In prescriptions weaker than -4 or so, it doesn't really matter much.  But in stronger prescriptions, the strength of lenses becomes "more plus" the farther glasses/contacts are from the eye.  That's why if a person's (say) -8 glasses are a little too weak, they can push them up towards their face -- it makes them effectively "stronger".  This is also why contacts prescriptions are different from glasses prescriptions - a -8 in contacts is like a -9 in glasses (*roughly*)...depending on the vertex distance!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hillary</b>&nbsp;22 May 2002, 09:20</p><p>Hi this is my first time posting here. But I need some advice about lenticular lenses. </p><p>I have needed some sort of correction as long as I can remember, but have been wearing contact lenses since I was a teenager(I am now in my mid-thirties.) Needless to say I am quite nearsighted. </p><p>Recently I went to my opthomologist complaining of blurred vision(I had a retinal detachment a few years ago, so I am hyper-cautious.) It turns out that I have a condition called corneal exhuastion, which in laymens terms means that I have to reduce contact lense wear drasticly(We are talking going down to like three days a week---eight hour days at that.) </p><p>I protested that this was not possible becuase of my job(I am a psychiatrist in private practice.) I see people all day long, and would like to avoid doing so in conspicously thick glasses.  </p><p>Well, my doctor recomended that I try lenticular lenses, which are glasses that only have the presciption in the middle of the lense. He showed me a sample. They are unlike any lenses I have ever seen. I am having my lenses blended so that the circular prescription part of the lense will not be that obvious. My glasses will be much thinner than they would otherwise. I am concerned though as how it is going to feel to wear such lenses, and not be able to have peripheral vision of any sort etc? </p><p>I ordered the glasses last week, and they will not be done for a few weeks yet(this always happens with high presciptions, plus my doctor prescribed bi-focals to cut down on the eye-strain, making my glasses very complicated.)So I have some time to get used to this. I picked out a relativly small frame, and am hoping my glasses will not be noticable at all to my patients. </p><p>What can I expect from these glasses. Will my vision be reduced at all? Will I have to adopt any special eye movements just to maximize whatever vision that I can get? </p><p>Any advise will be welcome. I may not be able to respond right away as I am very busy. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Hil</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;21 May 2002, 19:41</p><p>Bill Mac, </p><p> </p><p>First, my Rx as of 11/9/01, and it has not changed much for several years, is: </p><p> </p><p>R -5.25 +200 17 </p><p> </p><p>L -6.25 +200 178 </p><p> </p><p>I have a +2.50 for bifocals. </p><p> </p><p>Computer glasses Rx is: </p><p> </p><p>R -4.25 </p><p> </p><p>L -5.25 </p><p> </p><p>Bifocals +1.75 </p><p> </p><p>You probably do not need bifocals for several years but perhaps you should consider them for your work site.  Sounds as though you had a lower Rx for the work site but did not work out for you.  Why not consider a bifocal computer glasses Rx?  My Dr. did this for me several years ago and it seems to work.  He said OK to wear them all the time inside the office or at home, but not when going out, driving etc. </p><p> </p><p>The top is good for the computer screen and looking around the office or room at home.  The bottom is for reading what is on the desk or a book or the newspaper.  Mine are not progressive but you could do that if you are concerned about the bifocal lines showing at your age. </p><p> </p><p>This should relax your eyes when at office or home or even in a restaurant but not in a movie or driving etc. </p><p> </p><p>As you can see from my Rx, the top is reduced by 1 diopter and the bottom is reduced by 1.75 from that.  For a stronger Rx, like yours, the reduction may be more, not sure of that. </p><p> </p><p>Can't answer the other part of your question about distance from the eye.  Please expound on that.  Notice my Rx has a check mark for Vertex Distance 13.75.  I think that is on my regular Rx and the one for computer glasses.  I'm not sure what that means. </p><p> </p><p>What was the Rx of the glasses you had for the computer?  Did you keep taking them off and putting on you regular glasses because you could not see in distance?  A minus 1 diopeter for the top is not a big difference when you are a moderate high minus. </p><p> </p><p>After you read this would like your comments. </p><p> </p><p>Assume your contacts Rx is a bit different than your glasses.  I'm told that is how it works. </p><p> </p><p>Sorry this is so long but wanted to share what I know. </p><p> </p><p>Tommy </p><p> </p><p>PS Not sure why a -cylinder increases the total minus but a +cylinder does not.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bill Mac</b>&nbsp;21 May 2002, 09:07</p><p>Hi, I need some help with eyestrain and I wondered if someone out there could help.  My rx is about -10 in each eye.  I'm getting eyestrain and it is not a focusing issue.  It feels like my eyes don't want to converge through my thick glasses.  However, I've been told I converge great and when I wear contacts things are great.  Only problem is that I have allergies and the contacts don't work and I have to do close work all day.

<p><b>DaveMinus20</b>&nbsp;05 May 2002, 22:22</p><p>CR39 lenses is a brand name , which is Columbia Resin#39 (Columbia Laboratories, 39th resin formula. </p><p>The real name for this type of lens is ADC lenses, ADC is the chemical name for this type of resin, which is: Allyl Diglycol Carbonate...which is the lowest index of all lens materials, refractive index is 1.4/98. </p><p>I prefer this lens, when you get into hi-minus lenses, you get in trouble with chormatic abreations with hi-index type of lenses.....so in ADC lenses in hi minus you have a choice of thick lenses or myodisc.</p><p></p><hr>

For thicker lens (oops have been spelling it wrong, using an e)using same frames you have and like, why not try plastic CR39, would be lightweight and much clearer vision per DavidMinus20 posting.  You mention computer work, do you have special glasses for that?  They are usually about 1 diopter less than your regular Rx.  I find them very useful, much less strain than with your regular higher strength Rx.  Mine are bifocals, top for the computer and bottom for stuff on desk. </p><p> </p><p>Tom</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;02 May 2002, 10:24</p><p>DaveMinus20, thanks for your response and comments.  Noticed a posting of yours in another thread and you were DaveMinus18.  Posting was Feb. 2002.  Assume that was your Rx about that time.  Is your Rx still changing, how frequently and how much?  Assume your age is under 40 since you do not have bifocals.  When in college I met someone who had very strong minus, now that I think back could have been -15 or more and he had bifocals which I thought strange.  Now I read that is done by some eye Drs.to possibly slow myopic progression. Apparently that was not your experience.  You are lucky to have so many prs. of glasses.  With current high prices for good frames and the price of the best Varilux lenses which I have, most of us cannot afford multiple pairs.   </p><p> </p><p>T.   </p><p></p><hr>

Trifocals earlier because of early bifocals.  I wear regular plastic lenses with a plano base.  Works very well for me.</p><p></p><hr>

I guess it is just me being silly or something and making up things that I think I can't see. Otherwise I don't know what went wrong. </p><p>Yes I would like thicker lenses for some reason. I didn't have glasses until I got the ones I have now, so I was bare eyed lol and coping really really well. Didn't bump into things and such. The lenses now are high index lenses, so I guessw they could easily get thicker.

Also, how does the +3 work with trifocals?  Would not there have to be one plus for the lower portion and another for the middle portion?  My Rx is R -5.25, L =6.25 with +2.50 for bifocal.  Rx has changed a little up and down past several years.  I first had regular bifocals, flat top, when I early 40's and several years later went to progressive which after one bad experience works for me. Have expensive Varilux lenses, also quite thin, do not extend outside a retro tortise frame.  Bifocals were never suggested prior to that age so curious about you. Suppose early trifocals would follow early bifocals.  Perhaps I should have had bifocals earlier.  Did you consider or try progressives?  I have regular bifocals with weaker Rx of course for computer work and they are great.  A large bottom about 2 diopters less than my regular and a top about 1 diopter less.  This is beginning to sound too complicated.  Can't imagine using regular bifocals other than computer or reading.  Also would think trifocals hard to adjust to.  I sometimes read without glasses, of course holding things close.  Do you do that?  Also interested in what type of lenses you have, thick or thin, and do you use a smaller frame to minimize thickness? </p><p> </p><p>T. </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

Not sure what titanium lenses are, can you elaborate?  Also, you mention small frames, can you describe? Assume no bifocal since would not work in a small frame. What is you present Rx?  You mention -5.25/-6.25, then you mention -5.50 on 2/16, assume that could be new right but what about left? How long from the -3.5 to this?  I am -5.25/-6.25 +2.5.  Also have weaker Rx bifocal for computer.  Have expensive progressive for regular with the thinnest lenses I've ever had.  Frames cannot be too small since bifocal.  Would appreciate your comments.

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;01 May 2002, 12:45</p><p>The Guy, you mentioned a few times getting new glasses, stronger, but don't recall that you gave the new Rx. The one I noticed was -6.25/-6.75.  Mine is -5.25/-625 +2.50.  Also have computer glasses in weaker bifocal Rx. </p><p>How long did it take to progress to your present Rx?  Do you take them off for reading?

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;01 May 2002, 12:39</p><p>Daveminus20, interested in your progression to -20, at what age you got glasses and Rx and then what happened to now.  Do you have bifocals?  Can you read close without your glasses?  What type of lenses, thick or thin, or do you wear contacts?  What type of frame?  I am a -5.25/-6.25, with +2.50, progressive quite thin lenses but do take off sometimes when reading. Have retro tortise frame, hard to find, have source if interested.  Also have computer glasses with weaker Rx and bifocal also.  Hard for me to judge Rx by looking.  Have always been interested in stronger -Rx than I have but never tried, always look at others when I see that type of lense.  Thanks, Tom</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MetalRimmed</b>&nbsp;21 Feb 2002, 06:25</p><p>Well, Julian, I know, it was rather a nightmare.  </p><p>It was not that I had glasses and chose not to wear them. I didnt have glasses AT ALL.  </p><p>I was a student then and of course the board was always too far away and blurry. Sometimes this got me into embarassing situations. Once we had maths classwork and the teacher gave us photocopies with the assignment. He then wrote one last thing on the blackboard without dictating. I tried to copy the text, but later the teacher found a dozen errors in my script. </p><p>I found out a method that could help me continue to go without glasses at school. If I pressed my eyeball slightly with my fingers I could see more clearly! The same if I pulled the eyelid from the side </p><p>Maybe this was enough to help me on the schooldesk and as long as my eyesight was not so bad, but I was scared at having people call me in the street and not being able to recognize them from a distance. Or have people or relatives asking me Read that sign! or Can you see that price tag in the shop window? which seemed to happen more often than one could imagine. I was surrounded by people who thought my eyesight was perfect, and the worse my vision got the more difficult I found it to say that I needed glasses. </p><p>Of course I didnt take a driving licence until 22, while the rest of my friends couldnt wait one day after being 18. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2002, 17:59</p><p>MetalRimmed, you've got me really puzzled: how did you ever cope without glasses at 20 if you needed -3.5? I can't begin to imagine what job you were doing - if you were a student you couldn't see boards or screens; you couldn't drive; what the heck could you do and what did you do? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MetalRimmed</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2002, 07:57</p><p>I think that if I'd felt ok with my vision and had come to terms with wearing glasses from the start, I wouldn't have waited until I was 20 to go and have an eye test and get a pair of glasses.  </p><p>I realized I was in a funny situation having one's first pair of glasses made with -3.5, so I made up a story and told the optician I had broken my glasses, but I should be in the -3 range. With no previous eye test, that was a close guess! </p><p>However after that I found it difficult to meet friends and acquaintances with my new glasses on, especially because my prescription was rather high for a first pair of lenses.  </p><p>So I kept going out without glasses for a few years, until I decided I'd get contacts. Funnily I used glasses when I studied at home in my room, which I kept locked, although I could have gone without them for near vision. </p><p>My eyesight was deteriorating quickly and when I had my eyes tested for contacts, my prescription had risen to -4.45 and just a few months later it went up to -5.50 which is my current prescrition.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dockman</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2002, 07:42</p><p>Metal rimmed; You certainly need not feel weak around other people. As a matter of fact your eyes have so much refractory power that you have to wear glasses that lessen the power of refraction to bring the rays into focus on your retina. You're not weak, just the opposite. Your eyes have refractory power that most of the rest of us can only dream about and wish we had.</p><p></p><hr>

She showed up as one of the original few posters at the first incarnation of ES.  She claimed to be 15, extremely myopic, and having sex with a fair degree of regularity with a person over the age of majority who was, by coincidence, a high hyperope.  I daresay she certainly caught the attention of more than a few of us.  You have to remember that at that time, most of us who follwed ES were new to talking about our glasses fascination, and had gone, in a few short weeks, from thinking we were alone to thinking the world might be full of us, and were more naive than we are now, willing to believe anything.  I remember the Jennifer character once posting that her brother had brought home a new girlfriend who sported -50D glasses that were 4" thick or some such nonsense.  We gobbled it up. </p><p> </p><p>Subsequently (perhaps three years later), a considerably less intelligent version of her showed up, claiming to have had refractive surgery and posting a picture she asserted to be of herself, but which was already fairly well known from one of the optic obsessive sites around.  This second incarnation occurred on the second version of ES, perhaps one and a half or two years ago, and was definitely a pastiche. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AJ</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2002, 11:58</p><p>Yuen Ming:  Very interesting.  So, did you have laser surgery?  I am surprised that you were considered a candidate with a -32D Rx.  Usually, they are very skittish to do surgery on eyes with a refraction over about -16D.  Yours was  twice that.  One of the big problems is retinal detachments, but also with that high of an Rx, they had to remove a substantial amount of tissue from your corneas, which is not a particularly good thing to do.  Or did you have clear-lens extractions with lens implants?  But, that too is a very questionable procedure for a -32D Rx.  What is the strength of your glasses that you now have to wear?  Do you think you can see much better now?  Do you have any dryness or haloes or are you affected by lights?  What happened to your life as a physicist?  Lots of questions, but you have been gone for a looong time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Yuen Ming</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2002, 09:24</p><p>Hello everybody. </p><p>It's been awhile since I posted here. for those who don't know, I was a -32 myope. Then 2 years ago, I had corrective surgery, and I still wear glasses for fine tuning, but compared to the high myopia that I had for years, this has been a new lease on life for me. It's been particularly positive because I have since married and become a mother. While I was never ashamed of my glasses, this is is tremendosly more convenient, and, I believe, safer. So far, my son, who is 14 months, shows no signs of myopia, but I know this can develop anytime during childhood. Anyway, just wanted to touch bases with my Eye Scene compatriots. Hello Julian, Specs4Ever and some of you other old-timers, and greetings to the newer ones.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>myofan</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2002, 17:05</p><p>I've been following this site quietly  for some time. It has made me realise that I'm not the only man in the world with an 'interest' in GWG's, and I'm very grateful for that. </p><p>Like a few others out there, it seems, I'm particularly interested in ladies with high power glasses, preferably high minus but I'm turned on by high plus, too. How rarely do you see a lovely pair of lenticulars these days! </p><p>IMHO almost any lady is more attractive with a well-chosen pair of specs, so long as there is a bit of power there. </p><p>I wonder if any of your knowledgable contributors can say whether there is any practical or technical limit to the power of a minus spectacle lens. I have seen a few references on this site which suggest that -45d is about the practical limit, and I also seem to recall having seen once a suggestion that there was some technical limit at about -60d.  </p><p>Just curious</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2002, 09:23</p><p>Hey Stingray - e mail me if you want me to send you some pictures of myodisc lensed glasses.  There are many different types, and I can sort of give you a bit of an explaination.  I can be reached at roadrunner_122@hotmail.com. </p><p>Interesting discussion, and I think Andrea has a good idea, in that she can wear a much wider option of frames with her lower prescription.  Bryan is pretty much right on in his statement that most opticians won't even consider using myodiscs before a prescription gets up into the -20 range.  But, if one thinks about it, a myodisc can be made in regular plastic, giving a better abbe value, and lighter weight for a person with a prescription anywhere from -13 on up.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2002, 10:20</p><p>In really simple terms - a myodisc looks like a lens within a lens - because that's what it really is. Imagine a nice fat plus lens - then imagine the middle of it scooped out fiarly deep so that it becomes a hi-power minus lens. Blended myodiscs are ground out so that you can't see the scooped out middle bit quite so easily.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Russell</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2002, 10:03</p><p>Okay--here I am showing my ignorance.  Would someone please explain what myodiscs are and what they look like?  I thought I knew, but recent posts have led me to believe that I have no idea.  I want to be able to recognize them when I see them.  Thanks!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bryan292</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2002, 04:55</p><p>Andrea: I did say that myodiscs are usually reserved for over -20, but if you are fortunate enough to find an optician who will fight with the lens labs to get you what you want, there is no reason why you cant have myo's in a prescription as low as -10, especially if you want regular plastic in a large eye sized frame.  The only problem that I have seen is that the lens grinding labs try to force you to accept what they put out.  In most cases now, a person who requests, and pays for regular plastic now is given a hi index plastic - for no extra charge.  And, think about it - who really would complain about being given thinner lenses for free?  This happened to a neice of mine, who has been needing increases so frequently that the doctor suggested that the parents were wasting money on the thin lenses, so they specified regular plastic, and low and behold, hi index were supoplied for no extra charge.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrea</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2002, 15:16</p><p>Hi, I'm new to this site - it's fascinating. Bryan's comments are excellent except for one (very small) thing: I've got minus 17 glasses and I've had myodisc lenses for several years (even when my prescription was a bit weaker), so it's possible to get myodiscs for slightly less than minus 20. Mine have quite large bowls, but by having myos it means that the edges of the lenses are really thin and I can wear nice frames with no problem - both of which would be impossible with regular lenses. They are really good news, provided the lens area is large enough for decent peripheral vision, and with my script that's no problem. I got my first myos about three years ago, after a long time with very, very thick regular lenses, and I've never looked back, as the saying goes - and looking sideways is kinda tricky but you get used to it very quickly. What it does mean is that a lot of people don't even realise how fantastically crappy my sight is, and that's just fine - they see thin lens edges and they just think my specs are a bit weird. By the way, they are regular myodiscs - I tried the ones with smoothed edges and they drove me crazy since there is this sort of twilight zone between good vision and more or less no vision... What do other myodisc wearers think about that? Anyhow, a really interesting site. See ya.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bryan292</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2002, 12:53</p><p>Stingray, I first got myodiscs when my prescription got to be above -15.  I think this is because the old plastic lenses just were tooo thick to make.  A plano base is usually used around -8D and above, and in the old days, biconcave lenses came in around -12D.  Now, a myoduisc is reserved for over -20D, and biconcave is not really used too much either.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2002, 11:02</p><p>I have a curiousity about myodisks.  Perhaps someone here can answer these questions.  In my life, I can only vaguely recall 2 or 3 people wearing what I feel are myodisks lens in their eyeglasses.  Correct me if I am wrong, but are myodisks basically a lens within a lens?  What I would like to know is why is someone prescribed myodisks?  Is it because opticians cannot fashion a regular lens in that power?  At what power do myodisks become an option?  At what power is is not an option, but your only option?  There is reference I believe from Tammy and her blended myodisks.  What do they mean by blended?  How does that compare to regular myodisks.  Also along these lines, at what point does a prescription have to have a flat (plano base) front to them?  Sorry, for all the questions, but I was always taught that the stupidest questions was the one that was never asked.  Thank you for any insight you can give me to these questions.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2002, 20:29</p><p>Nubbins, a Rx that is so different from one eye to the next is hard to wear. Find yourself an artist of an optician and level with him or her about your "issues". Having a anti-reflective coating is key to having disparate lenses look OK. Any glasses intensive person can tell what's going on, but if you have very different prescriptions for each eye, modern technology can help you look normal to the casual observer. Your Rx is a big plus on one eye and even this can be made to look better with a combination of high-index and non-reflective lens coatings. </p><p> </p><p>Your eyes are different enough to warrant special care. If you were ever to have to become dependent upon your eye with less than optimum acuity, you might want to think about wearing some kind of safety-glasses, with appropriate prescription, all the time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>nubbins</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2002, 18:55</p><p>The reason I was wondering is this... as I have written before, I have one eye with perfect vision and one eye without. I mostly wear one contact lens, but I also occasionally wear my glasses. My contact lens rx is +2.75, though I do not know my glasses rx, I know that it must be weaker than this. I can never quite tell if there is magnification or not... and that is one of the reasons I am self conscious about wearing my glasses. If my eyes both had similar rx's I dont think it would be that big a deal... I just hate the idea of having one normal size eye and one much larger... Thanx for your input!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2002, 12:33</p><p>I don't think I personally would notice *magnification*, per se, until the + prescription was pretty strong...maybe +3 at least, probably more.  Magnification and minification from lenses is really pretty subtle (especially compared to other effects of the lenses), and since some people have bigger eyes or smaller eyes than others, for me it's pretty hard to say I can see magnification.  But the distortion of the edge of the wearer's face in the lens is pretty noticable even for pretty weak prescriptions (maybe +1 or so).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;11 Dec 2001, 18:47</p><p>Amber, </p><p>    I think you should probably wait until you are older and see whether your eyes stabilize a bit before you have surgery.  Surgery options for farsightedness might be better in 5-10 years, too.  Being a teenager with strong glasses is certainly a pain, but laser surgery is risky enough that you probably want a higher payoff if possible.  Can you wear contacts?

The web was full of weird topics, and I tried to narrow it down, to no avail.  Do you know if this Dr. Obrig was the same Theodore Obrig that came up with the first plastic contact lenses?  Also, if you can let me know where you came up with the info I would love to see if I could find the book. </p><p>Thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>nubbins</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2001, 16:20</p><p>The chem class requirement has changed! I am a molecular and cellular biology graduate student and at grad school and in  college we were allowed to wear contacts (with safety glasses over, or if we chose we could wear glasses with safety glasses over!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2001, 10:03</p><p>True, appropriate eye protection is essential in industrial situations; however, it is almost impossible without wearing fully enclosed goggles to totally protect the eye.  Windblown matter is much more prevalent in some industrial situations such as refineries where I used to work. </p><p> </p><p>As far as your chem lab, you are right in that they didn't require proper safety glasses to be worn, at least not when I was in high school about 40 years ago.  I suspect that their requirements have changed in recent years. </p><p> </p><p>I'm not entirely sure who makes the rules, perhaps OSHA has somme input; however, I believe that a major concern is that a company may be setting themselves up for a large law suit if an employee were to sustain permanent damage to their eye(s) because they were wearing contacts and the injury would have been prevented or at least minimized if they had not been.   </p><p> </p><p>Let me also add that my knowledge on this subject could be dated, I know that it was the case about 20 years or so ago when I was in a position that had me involved with a training program for new hires who were training to work in the feild as craftsmen.  I have not heard of anything since, my more recent assignments have been in the office, that has changed that position but it certainly could have changed without my being aware of it. </p><p> </p><p>Regards, </p><p>Specs4Me</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2001, 08:50</p><p>Specs4Me, </p><p>    I wonder who sets these rules and what they're based on.  I mean, if there is a significant risk of something getting in the eye such that contacts would be a problem, then the person should probably be wearing better eye protection.  I've gotten dirt and eyelashes and other things in my eyes many times and I'd rather be wearing contacts than not in these cases -- it's almost impossible for small matter to get under a soft contact, and the contact keeps the dirt from touching the cornea, which is much more sensitive than the white part of the eye. </p><p>   In cases where the contact could be melted into the eye, then contacts could be a real risk.  Still, I'm inclined to think that the no-contacts rules might create problems of their own.  For example, in college, we weren't allowed to wear contacts in chemistry lab, but regular glasses were considered satisfactory eye protection, even though they really didn't provide good protection for the eyes.  So I think the rules probably caused more problems than they helped in that case.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2001, 08:21</p><p>Puffin, </p><p>In many industries there is a ban on wearing contacts for a number of reasons.  Among them the more obvious are the fact that there are often wind-blown objects floating around which can get in the eye, this is bad enough without contacts; however with contacts can cause serious damage to the eye.  Another is the danger of wearing contacts around welding, if a person gets a flash from a welding arch, it is possible for the contacts to adhere to the eye, this could cause pretty serious irritation upon removal. </p><p> </p><p>These bans on wearing contacts on the job are for the wearers own protection. </p><p> </p><p>Regards, </p><p>Specs4Me</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2001, 04:08</p><p>I was talking to someone yesterday who is a mechanic in a bus depot, and he told me that he could not wear glasses because of his job. I assume something to do with dust in the workplace would cause this, or maybe his employer isn't keen on people searching for contact lenses! </p><p> </p><p>This brings this question, does anyone know any professions or jobs where wearing of contact lenses is either prohibited or heavily discouraged? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2001, 20:26</p><p>I recently got an old set of trial cataract glasses in mint condition.  There are 6 pairs, all about +13 or +14D (I estimate), in a range of PDs.   </p><p> </p><p>It's quite interesting, since with powers of that magnitude, PD is crucial to accurate alignment of the wearer's eyes.   </p><p> </p><p>The narrowest PD is far too narrow for me, and makes it impossible for my eyes to diverge far enough to align on distant objects.  Even looking at something up close, my eyes do not converge much, since the induced prism from the off-center lenses acts as a strong base-in prism.   </p><p> </p><p>By contrast, the widest PD is far too wide for me, and I end up going quite cross-eyed even to look at far-off objects.  Combined with the huge magnification effect of strong plus lenses, this induced base-out prism effect makes the wearer look quite dopey and befuddled.  Imagine eyes everal times their normal size, turned in towards the wearer's nose.  It's quite a sight. </p><p> </p><p>Ha, NeuroJoe would love this post.</p><p></p><hr>

Rx, and then right next to it the same girl, same frame, same Rx BUT with myodiscs, with a seeming 25mm segment/bowl.

<p><b>Tom the Hungarian</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2001, 08:29</p><p>Your point is well taken, Curt, the intellectuals' productive life may have been curtailed by presbiopia in days before glasses. The only reason why this may not have had too great an effect is that so few people reached the "advanced age" when presbyiopia starts to have significant effect (say 45?). I read recently that the average age lifespan used to be in the late 20s. This was, of course, caused by very high child mortality rates but, still, there were not that many reaching the 50s or 60s.  Tom  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2001, 07:33</p><p>Another interesting spin on this is how presbyopia must have effected the population before glasses.  If you were a tradesman (doctor, jeweler, even clergy who were required to read manuscripts and books,etc.) where your job required very good close vision, the onset of presbyopia could mean the end of your productivity (and maybe your job). Once you were no longer able to see close up, you could no longer function and were of little use.  The invention of the magnifying glass (+ lens) changed all that, but if you were washed up at 40-50, life must have been very different. Humm.......</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>nubbins</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2001, 17:23</p><p>I wouldnt call weakness an advantage. While it is true that humans are weaker than many other beasts... I think it is because we started developing our brains and relying on our intellect to figure things out and create things like the lever to lift heavy things. Because we invented such things we no longer had to be as strong and therefore weaker humans were able to propogate and were not selected against... In terms of eyesight... A long time ago in early humans... im sure that weak eyesight was selected against, but as we developed our intellect and much later developed glasses and such, this weak eyesight no longer threatened survival and therefore it is no longer selected against. I think it increased not only because of human lifestyle, but also because it was no longer selected against. Just a thought... I have no ideas about why certain ethnicities have the eyesight they do.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2001, 06:08</p><p>Back in the Dark Ages when I did Biology at school - we did a little bit about genetics - not that anyone really knew much about it at the time. Anyway - we learned about something called a 'lethal mutation' which was explained to us as any genetic defect that COULD leave you in big trouble if our environment changed. It went something like this - some guys have hairy chests and some don't. If we were homeless and there was a sudden Ice Age - the guys without hairy chests would die! I think most human beings have about a dozen of these so-called 'lethal mutations' - and no doubt myopia is one of them - along the lines of - if you had to go out and hunt for small animals without glasses tomorrow - you'd probably starve to death!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2001, 05:20</p><p>Dances-with-Wolves, </p><p>   It isn't obvious that myopia can be considered an adaptation in the evolutionary sense.  It's usually not in any way an "advantage" for people younger than 30...these people can see things close up just fine.  (Yeah, there are exceptions, but not enough to affect evolution.)  Anything that happens after age 40 is not relevant to evolution, because people have already had plenty of time to pass on their genes.  So it doesn't seem like an adaptation.   </p><p>  On the other hand, there may be some strange evolutionary advantage in "weakness".  Some examples we know are true:  humans are very weak (physically) compared to other large primates and compared to other early homonids (Neanderthal).  Also, women are considerably smaller in size and musculature than men.  So why not add myopia to the list; it couldn't affect everyone, because then hunting would be too hard, but it could affect some, and those would be village dwellers...skilled tradespeople, like you said.  This is a very interesting possibility, and might explain why the eye can become myopic so 'easily' (seriously, well over half the people in college are myopic, probably over 2/3) despite it seeming to be a disadvantage in an evolutionary way. </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dances-with-voles</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2001, 02:17</p><p>Nearsightedness could have been an advantage in more civilized cultures.

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2001, 11:06</p><p>The myopia and literacy thing is interesting, but one might also consider the effect of limited genetic diversity and the removal of natural 20-20 vision as a survival factor. </p><p> </p><p>Jewish populations are subject to a series of genetic predispositions to diseases, Tay-sachs and certain types of breast cancer being two I can think of off the top of my head.  The Ashkenazim (sp?) are particularly susceptible, to the point that Rabbis are now frequently consulting genetic tests when counsellig potential married couples (I know this because the lab in which I used to work did some of this predictive testing).  These populations are isolated genetically, simply because they don't often outbreed.  Other populations that are of great interests to geneticists for various diseases and conditions are the Fins (small population, linguistically isolated) and the Japanese.  Presuming myopia to be polygenic (contributed to by many different genes)and generally recessive (something I have no real evidence for other than the intuitive), it makes sense that it would rise in frequency quite quickly in populations that traditionally do not outcross much. </p><p> </p><p>My second point is that even small amounts of myopia used to mean decreased life expectancy - you couldn't hunt as well, you couldn't avoid danger as well.  Since the widespread use of eyeglasses, the effect on reproductive potential of myopia is negligible (with me as a mate, in fact, a myopic woman would be MORE likely to have many children, simply because we'd end up in the sack so much more often, but that's beside the point).  The result is that there is no longer much (if any) selection pressure against nearsightedness, and entropy will favor its increase in the world's population. </p><p> </p><p>I have no doubt that nurture plays a role in individual penetrance of the trait as well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Scott</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2001, 09:40</p><p>Glenn - My trifocals are lined.  The optician really insisted I try progressives when I went to trifocals.  Couldn't get used to the peripheral distortion.  They gave me the lined trifocals at no extra charge since I didn't like the progressives.  Since I had worn bifocals since college days, getting used to trifocals was easy.  The reason I was prescribed bifocals in college (Freshman) was because of headaches when studying for long periods of time. The doctor thought it might also slow down the myopic progression.  I don't think it helped since my prescription is about a -2.00 more than it was in college.    </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Franklein</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2001, 06:21</p><p>I am getting ready to catch the schoolbus so I just a have a short time but Alan's posting sounded interesting (showed it to my Dad too) Let me say, first of all that I am not at all sure whether my corrected vision is getting worse or not. I may have ben wrong when I said I had 20/20 with my specs. Mother doesn't remember either but she doesn't think I had 20/20. My eye doctor told me that some doctors think that bifocals slow down the deterioration of myopia but she doesn't think there is sufficient evidence. Maybe next year I ask Mom to try another doctor. It may be worth trying bifocals if there is any chance of success although Mom says they are a pain in the ass. I agree that a lot more than vanity is at stake and if my eyes were to get too bad for driving, that would be quite a handicap. The doctor explained to me about retinal problems but didn't think there was anything to worry about it at this stage although anything over -8 is somewhat in the danger area.  </p><p> </p><p>My Dad thinks that myopia is an evolutionary adaptation and I have read on the Internet somewhere (unfortunately I don't remember where) that the incidence of myopia is on the increase all over the civilized world. Dad thinks it's because of the growing need for close work but the article I read said something slightly different. It said it may be the consequence of lots of close work. I don't think there is doubt that it is genetic. Jews (I am an example) have always had lots of myopia. Is it a coincidence that Jews had been a very literate poeople for many centuries now? I don't think so. Japanese are also likely to be myopic but I don't know if there is a connection with their lifestyle historically (I know zilch of Japanese history prior to Pearl Harbor). Where we live there are lots of Native Americans and it is amazing how many are nearsighted and how many need very strong lenses. I asked Dad how that would go with his idea on evolution. A hunting people would find myopia a disadvantage. I assume that this is a recent development and that myopia is generally caused by a mixture of genetics and lifestyle. And you should all believe me because of course I know all the answers (as Mom says frequently and in a markedly unkind tone). </p><p> </p><p>Fran </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2001, 05:23</p><p>Lots of optometrists make the same deduction as you, Dances-with-Wolves.  It seems to make sense, but I'm not sure it actually works that way...part of the stress involved may go beyond the accomodation (bending) of the lens.  Or perhaps it just isn't enough -- even with an add for reading, it's possible for the eye to do a fair amount of accomodating.  When looking at something at a medium distance through the distance part of the glasses, or when looking at something very close up (say, 6 inches).  I'm not sure -- it seems to be somewhat complicated.  It's not totally apparent that including an add for reading slows or stops myopia progression -- progression still happens for a lot of people anyway.  I'm not sure whether any good studies have been done to see how much it works, but my guess is that there have been studies and the results were *statistically* insignificant...meaning it's conceivable that any difference was just due to chance.  So, either the problem is more complicated, or the bifocal add just isn't enough -- not strong enough, too easy to circumvent, or something like that.  Finally, in some cases myopia may be a result of genetic things and not this "near-point pressure", and for these people, none of this may matter...I'm really not sure if that's ever true or how often, but it's definitely conceivable. </p><p>   I haven't heard the following hypothesis proposed anywhere, but I'm curious if it has been investigated.  OK, most children are farsighted when they are very young but have good vision at some point.  For the majority of them, the good vision lasts quite a while before they start to become nearsighted in adolescence. (And quite a few people continue to have good distance vision throughout their life.) So, how is it that the eye can be so well calibrated, at least for a while, in so many cases?  Do the genes just know the *exact* shape to make the eyeball?  I don't think so.  I think the eye has a calibration mechanism...namely, if it is forced to consistently accomodate to see things clearly, it changes shape so that it can see those things clearly without accomodating.  For some people, this mechanism is more sensitive and by doing a lot of reading they trick their eye into thinking it needs to adjust for that...so they become nearsighted, then get minus glasses, making the eye think it has to adjust further, thus becoming more nearsighted, then stronger glasses, the eye adjusts more, and so on...until the eye stops developing at age 20 or so.  For other people, the mechanism is not as sensitive, and doing some reading doesn't fool the eye into thinking it has to change.  For other people, the mechanism is still weaker, and the eye doesn't change shape as much and they remain farsighted (and then maybe they get glasses, fooling the eye into thinking it really doesn't need to change shape, and they stay farsighted). </p><p>   This is pretty hard to validate without really doing a lot of work.  However near- or farsighted a person turns out, you can always suppose the same thing would have happened if they had been prescribed different glasses (or none at all).  So a person would have to make a statistical argument...but the basis would have to include people who either didn't have glasses (probably hard to find in this country) or consistently didn't wear their glasses (hard to verify).   </p><p>   Still, the idea that the eye responds to its input makes a lot of sense to me, because I just can't imagine how eyes could be calibrated just on the basis of genetic input.  Organisms' development is really impressive, but it doesn't usually do things that are this hard if it doesn't have to. </p><p>    Well, there's my pet theory.  Awfully long-winded, I realize...sorry. </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dances-with-voles</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2001, 01:42</p><p>I read somewhere that the U.S. Navy did experiments with monkeys or apes which confirmed that myopia could be made worse by wearing glasses.  If myopia is caused by the eye adapting to be better for close work (like reading), it should follow that using a reading addition would reduce the stress on the eye, and slow the progression of myopia.   </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2001, 19:10</p><p>Franklein, </p><p>    I'm curious, do you know whether your corrected vision is getting worse? You said in an earlier post that it was about 20/20, but your doctor said with the new prescription it will be 20/40 in one eye and 20/50 in the other.  Do you think your corrected vision just isn't as good as you thought, or do you think it is getting worse.  (That does happen with high myopia, but I don't know if it's expected at your age/prescription...)   </p><p>   Anyway...all this talk about legal blindness...  I definitely think stronger glasses put pressure on your eyes to adjust -- that is, to become more nearsighted.  That's not easily substantiated by research, partly because doctors can't just do experiments where they overprescribe patients and see what happens.  But do find out whether you see a lot better with your new glasses than with your current ones; if not, you might as well stick with the current ones.  And maybe ask your doctor if she/he thinks there is any way to slow down your eyes' progression...there may not be, but if there is, I think it's worth noting that there is more than vanity at stake here.  There is also the issue of decreasing corrected vision and retinal detachments...perhaps you already know that.  (??)  (I don't mean to scare you, but since you've clearly been willing to put a lot more 'work' into your vision than most people, you might as well make sure there is nothing being missed.) </p><p> </p><p>Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Franklein</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2001, 13:59</p><p>I forgot to say that the doctor checked my vision with the new prescription and it will be 20/40 for the right and 20/50 for the left eye, 20/40 combined, perfectly fine for driving eventually, which is one thing worrying me. Of course I am too young at the moment. Alan, I didn't think of asking him to check my vision with the present prescription or without glasses. That was a mistake in view of the debate here. I still think those numbers are wrong. Being legally blind (20/200 with glasses) means you need a cane to walk and that's pretty bad! I don't see much on the ground without my specs but enough not to need a cane and I managed to walk around fairly well without glasses while I was on my stupid program (although I mostly did it where I knew the area because, of course, I couldn't possibly read street signs without glasses). </p><p> </p><p>Fran </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2001, 13:42</p><p>Franklein, </p><p>   That's a lot of change considering you thought your eyesight hadn't gotten worse.  When you were at the eye doctor, did she/he check your acuity with your current glasses (and do you know what it was)?  I'm curious -- when you get your new glasses, could you tell us how much clearer things are? </p><p>   As for feeling stupid, don't.  Maybe these programs sometimes work, maybe they don't.  But there's certainly reason to believe that our lifestyles have an impact on our vision.  (Nearsightedness is a lot more common now than it was 100 years ago.  And so is education...reading...)  But there may simply not be a feasible method for making things better, especially for people whose eyes are a lot more prone to nearsightedness.

Out of curiosity, have you tried wearing contacts?  They would probably would get in the way of your program (ie going uncorrected).  Also, do you have old (weaker) glasses you can wear instead of going completely uncorrected -- I don't know if that would fit into your program or not, but I think it would.

If I were your age and if I didn't already have to wear thick, ugly lenses, I would agree with you but as it is, an hour a day isn't so bad a price to pay for stopping my eyes from getting worse. I reall hate the things. In the evening I got to put them in the same place near y bed or else I never find them and I put them on first thing and take them off when I go to bed or else I am blind (not quite true, I don't wear them in the shower LOL). As for proof: I know that my eyes haven't changed for about a year and maybe improved and that is good enough proof for me. You asked for my prescription. It is Right Eye -7.75 with astimatism -0.75 and Left Eye -8.50 with astigmatism -1.00. I don't remember the angle for astigmatism but that doesn't matter anyway so much.

And you might not have to do it forever; most people's eyes don't change much after age 20 or 25.  But for me, I wonder if it would have been worth it.  I kind of like wearing my glasses...they're not too strong, they're comfortable, and they look nice. Lots of people here (on this site) like their glasses.  But some probably don't, and certainly lots of other people in the world don't like glasses at all.  Good luck.  If you're 14 now, and this works, then you might eliminate a lot of prescription increase you would have had otherwise.  Plus, when you put your glasses on after not wearing them for a while, aren't you amazed by how clear it is? </p><p> </p><p>--Alan</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Franklein</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2001, 09:01</p><p>I am surprised noone showed interest in my posting about a method to stop myopia from increasing. I would have thought that there would be others among all he myopes on this site who do not want their eyes to get worse. And it is simple! The diet is basic vegetarian, which is good for you anyway. I lost pounds that I needed to do. The exercizes take 20 minutes 3 times a day. The hardest is going without your specs (if your eyes are as bad as mine!). I always put them at night in the same spot on my bedside table because otherwise I never find them and I used put them on first thing and wear them till bed time at night non-stop. (I tried contacts but had too much trouble with them.) No I only wear them when I must like to class at school to see the boardor movies. I don't at home and I don't in the street even when I walk in familiar areas. I don't recogniz anybody that way of course but so what. My Mom is worried to death and I once twisted an ankle not seeing a hole in the sidewalk and fell a couple of time but nothing serious. Next week is my eye appointment and I let you know. I am quite sure that for the first time in years I will not need stronger lenses and maybe it will be a little like 0.25 or 0.50 less!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Franaklein</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2001, 14:54</p><p>I don't have lenses as strong as you all butthey're strong enough and I hate them. I started wearing specs when I was 4 and they discovered I was nearsighted. Since then every year I go to have my eyes tested and - you guessed - I get stronger prescriptions every year, sometimes .50, sometimes .75, on one occasion even 1.00. I am now 14. Last year they got so strong that they made them with a flat front which I am told is a sign of real high myopia or nearsigtedness. I got real fed-up with this shit and I heard about a program - a local one - that claimed it can stop eyes getting worse and even make them better. It promises eventually you can see without glasses. So I went and I have been doing diet and eye exercizes since and I am supposed to go without my specs as much as I can but of course I have to wear them quite a bit because I am so blind like I can't see the blackboard at school or movies or even the TV. And you know what? I think it works!!! I think my eyes didn't get any worse in almost a year, maybe 10 months, I even think they got a little better. I am going to eye test next week and I am real excited about it! Will let you know of result and then you all can try this system. Fran </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rosie</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2001, 13:51</p><p>Hi Amber - those are really strong glasses, especially with the extra +5 (is that for close reading?) Have you worn that kind of prescription since you were very young? And do you find you have any problems with your glasses? I have been told that strong plus lenses can be much more difficult to get good vision through than strong minus ones. But you'll probably tell me that's not true. Me, I'm just a relatively modestly myopic minus 5.75 (though I'm more or less helpless without them). </p><p></p><hr>
