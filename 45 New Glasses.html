<p><b>Jake</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2018, 16:44</p><p>I agree, Soundman. Precisely for that reason, I don't post a picture of myself :) I'm just trying to be safe given the amount of unsavory individuals who have frequented the site recently. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2018, 16:02</p><p>Last post was a shitpost.  Unless you post a picture of yourself wearing glasses, I don't believe who you are.  All you anonymous trolls are fuckheads.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2018, 05:38</p><p>I got my first glasses a longer time ago, and they look almost the same as the big vintage frames I just posted pictures of.  My first prescription was -2 something.  I was a child and never saw the exact numbers but I remember my parents being upset about how strong it was.  It probably seemed clear at that point that I was going to grow up to wear thick glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2018, 20:01</p><p>30calcat </p><p> You said they go back about twenty years, Is that when you got your first glasses, and what was your first prescription. </p><p> I also always  get CR 39,  not only for the cost, but I like wearing thick lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;19 Jul 2018, 17:55</p><p>The pictures on Flickr are a collection of glasses going back almost 20 years, so the lens powers vary.  I try to keep the lenses on my favorite frames updated, but I like so many different frames so it can be difficult.  It helps that I usually go with CR39 lenses, which keeps the cost of my glasses hobby under control.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;19 Jul 2018, 01:56</p><p>Since 1980s glasses styles are coming back, I seized the opportunity to re-experience a lovely pair of glasses that I wore for years as a child: </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47355639@N00/42785877944/in/dateposted-public/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/47355639@N00/42785877944/in/dateposted-public/</a> </p><p> </p><p>I got new lenses for them, and am loving the comfortable feeling of a heavy pair of plastic frames with big, smooth nose pads sliding up and down my nose.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2018, 22:38</p><p>newglasses, </p><p>I thought I would take a few minutes and explain a bit about how Vision works.  Vision actually occurs in the brain.  Your eyes are merely biological cameras.  A Sphere prescription of -3.25 means that you have Myopia or  "built in" +3.25 reading glasses.  That in turn means that everything beyond about 31 cm or 12 inches is increasingly blurry, unless you also have some Astigmatism.  If you also have some Cylinder (and Axis) (they always go together) in your glasses, the blur will start closer than the distances mentioned above. </p><p>The brain has amazing ability to correct some blur, IF it knows what something is supposed to look like, but it takes a lot of energy and effort.  With external correction using either glasses or contact lenses, your brain gets high quality images from your eyes and the image processing is no longer necessary.  I usually takes a few days for your brain to stop correcting the images, which you are noticing.  Many people think that their glasses made their vision worse, but they really do not. </p><p>If you stop wearing your glasses, which are labor saving devices for your brain,  your brain can go back to correcting the images, but it will take some time and it will likely complain as you are also experiencing.  All of this is normal. </p><p>Because your first prescription is -3.25 and as I mentioned above you have built in reading glasses, you may experience some problems focusing close with your glasses.  That is because your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses have not had  to do much, if any, focusing.  It is very likely that your Ciliary Muscles are very weak.  Normally, the Ciliary Muscles in your eyes are the strongest muscles in the body, for their very tiny size.  If you experience discomfort when you do close work with your glasses, you can take them off, but a better solution would be to increase the distance a bit by holding things a bit farther from your eyes.  If that become a problem, let me know and I will offer some suggestions on how to build up your Ciliary Muscles so they can focus effortlessly. </p><p>Lastly, you need to fact the fact that you really do need vision correction in some form.  The very best thing to do is just wear your glasses full time.  Remember, you wear vision correction for YOUR benefit.  You do not need the approval of anyone else to see well. There will be comments and questions, but that only lasts for a few days.  After that, you will only get questions if you DON't wear your glasses or change frame styles.  It is a bit like changing your hair style or getting new clothes. </p><p>Also remember that everyone you see, who wears vision correction, experienced the same anxiety about wearing glasses in front of parents, relatives, friends and associates.  The quicker you get over the anxiety, the better. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>newglasses</b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2018, 17:14</p><p>sorry maxim accidentally wrote you as my name!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2018, 17:13</p><p>Hi Maxin, </p><p> </p><p>thanks for your helpful answers.  torn as to whether or not i will accept myself as a fulltime wearer but it kinda seems inevitable at this point.  i literally feel like i need them to see things on my computer too.  i also posted in "vision" cause i wasn't sure which thread was best so u can stay updated there too with my journey with glasses. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2018, 15:07</p><p> </p><p>... just keep on wearing them and enjoy! </p><p> </p><p>As long as you wear them, you forget that you're wearing them! </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Are you boy or girl, man or woman, what age, what place?  </p><p>But this recommendation is always the same. </p><p> </p><p>I cannot imagine the need for a -3,25 correction without using this correction. You're better off when you are giving in, you won't be unhappy, that's for sure.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2018, 15:00</p><p> </p><p>With a -3,25 prescription, in my eyes, you don't need the glasses for listening to the radio, but for all other activities like watching TV, driving or bike riding, going to the movies, reading bus or traffic signs, or seeing, which person is waving friendly from the other side of the street, you are much, much better off with glasses on.  </p><p> </p><p>I feel there is no choice, but you should not be unhappy, just look for nice looking glasses resenting a nice appearance. And, be happy, as with an "3,25 only" prescription, problems like retinal detachment or usually NOT linked. </p><p> </p><p>Turn your pessimism into optimism, look into a good future of your vision development. I can only send you my gratulations, that you have such a good vision now!  </p><p> </p><p>Think about my words, you might agree after a weeks time??</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>newglasses</b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2018, 11:13</p><p>So I recently just got glasses around a week ago and I have found it inevitable to have to use them for certain things like watching the TV, seeing the board at school and in general, seeing anything far away.  So I slip them on for those activities and take them off afterwards.  But around three days ago I have been finding myself leaving them on after those activities.  Is that bad??? Does that mean Im becoming full time?? I just like seeing things clearly but I dont want my eyes to deteriorate especially because my optician said my first prescription is pretty high.  But now when I take off my glasses, the world is a literal blur and I feel like Im going to bump into people and I get a headache so I just put them back on.  Can I break out of this full time habit without getting headaches or feeling nauseous without my glasses?! This didnt happen a week ago.  My prescription is -3.25 in both eyes. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 May 2018, 11:03</p><p>KidsWithGlasses </p><p>Well there is no doubt that the 10 year old and 7 year old are  going to be wearing their glasses full time when they get them.The doctor is doing the right thing by only giving them both a partial of their full prescription because their eyes wouldn't be able to handle the strength of their glasses if they got their full prescription all at once. So they will still both be happy with how much better their going to be able to see with their new glasses but as their eyes adjust to their glasses it won't be long before they start noticing that their vision isn't as good as it will be when they first get their glasses. The doctor said 6 months but the 10 year old may need to go back sooner than that to get her glasses changed. Actually you should only get the lenses changed in her glasses since that will be cheaper to do. The 7 year old might be able to make the full 6 months. So the other 3 must not be too bad if the are getting their full prescription right away. Did the doctor say when they need to wear their glasses? I mean did he say they should also wear their glasses full time or just for certain things? Even though your 14 year old has the best eyesight of the 5 he or she should still wear his or her glasses all the time so the others will follow his /her lead. Usually kids will follow what the oldest does. As well as their mother. How do your kid feel about having to wear glasses? Are they looking forward to it or are they complaining about having to start wearing glasses? When are their glasses supposed to be ready. If they said a week you should expect a call sooner than that. I'm sure it's going to seem funny for you seeing all of your kids wearing glasses?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KidsWithGlasses</b>&nbsp;21 May 2018, 08:32</p><p>The oldest is 14, then 10, 7,6 and 3. </p><p>The 10 year old was the one who could not even tell there was an eye chart on the wall for the first part of the exam, so the doctor had her move closer until she could make out anything. She also had the biggest letters in the projection part of the exam before the doctor slid the black binocular things infront of her. She was also the only one who had a little trouble with the near vision. However they will not be giving her reading glasses because apparently she may have only been having trouble because the lenses she had infront of her eye were making things smaller and she is not used to it. She also has to go in in six months to get her higher prescription filled so she can see as well as she can. They will see if she could benefit from bifocals then too. These would help her see far and near in one pair of glasses. </p><p>The 7 year old is the one that thought the big E was an equal sign, and she tried guessing on the second line but she was wrong. The doctor also had her move forward and she did much better. She also has to go back in 6 months to make sure she is still seeing okay in her glasses. </p><p>The other three did better on the chart. My oldest did the best followed by the 6 year old and then the three year old.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 May 2018, 08:06</p><p>Kids With Glasses </p><p>I'm sure that you were quite shocked to find out that all 5 need to be wearing glasses now. You need to understand that your kids without getting an eye exam have no way real way of knowing their is anything wrong with their eyesight, They only think that how and what they seeing is the way everyone is seeing things. That is the reason getting eye exams at least every 2 years is such a good idea not only for your kids you as well. I assume at this point your kids don't have their glasses yet and they are waiting for them to be made up? I know you said the youngest is 3 years old. What are the ages of all of your kids and the one that thought the big "E" was an equal sign i'm sure is going to be wearing glasses full time but what about the others? Will they all being wearing their glasses full time when they get them?  </p><p>Since you weren't prescribed glasses and eyesight is generally provided by the parents genes I would have to assume that the father of your kids wears glasses and has since he was young? If you were dealing with eye strain i'm a bit surprised that you weren't prescribed glasses to take away the strain and relax your eyes more. Also depending on te ages of your kids some of them may be reluctant to wearing glasses. It would help to encourage them to wear their glasses if you also were wearing glasses.  </p><p>With that many that mare going to be wearing glasses you should consider ordering their glasses on line where they are much cheaper than a local shop.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>KidsWithGlasses</b>&nbsp;21 May 2018, 07:32</p><p>Hi,my name is Karen. I am a mom of five, and today i found out all my kids need glasses. I was having trouble with eye strain and booked myself an appointment to see an eye doctor. My family does not usually go to an eye doctor, so I figured I would take the kids with me and have them all looked at too in case any of them need glasses or anything. I honestly did not think any of them would need glasses except may that the second oldest may need reading glasses.  </p><p>To my shock all of my kids including my 3 year old need glasses, but I do not. Has anyone else had a similar experience? If so please let me know how it was, and how badly did your kids need glasses like hoe much of the chart could they even make out? One of mine could not see any of it, she did not even know where the letters were. Another thought the big E was an equal sign. </p><p>I feel so bad for not taking action earlier I had no idea my kids were struggling this much to see. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2018, 10:44</p><p> </p><p>to Soundmanpt: </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for taking this right, and thank you for your friendly answer!  </p><p> </p><p>This should not be too much critizism towards your question, I just wanted to point out, that Jennifer has found her way now, in balance with herself, her own personality and her wishes. We are all free to look back, but it is also important to look forward, and she is looking forward now, with many vision experiences now, day by day. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2018, 09:27</p><p>Maxim </p><p>I get your point and honestly hope and certainly didn't intend for my question to make her feel the way you think she might. The point of my question was why now after she admittedly stated that she needed to be wearing glasses much sooner than when she finally got them. I guess what I was curious about was what was the final straw that made her go for an eye exam and get her glasses? I in no way intended to make her feel guilty and I hope she didn't take it that way.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2018, 15:34</p><p> </p><p>Commenting Soundman's remarks: </p><p> </p><p>".... why did you put off getting glasses for so long? You seem to have clearly known that you needed to be wearing glasses for quite a while. Was it just that you didn't want to be seen wearing glasses or something else? ....". </p><p> </p><p>Why are you asking this poor girl so many questions, she might feel a kind of guilty after reading your questions! </p><p> </p><p>Every morning is a new morning, and we are lucky when we get the opportunity going into the new day, avoiding yesterday's errors. She's proudly wearing here glasses now, she is convinced, not forced into wearing her glasses. Such shortcomings in vision creep in slowly over time, and we are not aware of it from the very first moment. Sometimes we're astonished, and asking a friend: "can you see this?", and fences or rooftops are just surfaces without structures, and trees might be green balloons. </p><p> </p><p>Of course she did not avoid wearing glasses intentionally, as she did not know, which world of clear vision would be open to her, when a myopia of 1.50 with an astigmatism of 2.50 would undergo correction!  </p><p> </p><p>So, every day is a new day, and Jennifer can start her day, with a precision of seeing things unknown before, and she can discover a new world of vision every morning. </p><p> </p><p>So don't ask these questions, a glasses wearer could go a step back to seeing without glasses, but most of them would not go backwards - every day is a new day, and we all try to avoid yesterday's errors and shortcomings. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2018, 11:05</p><p>PS.: </p><p>remark on Voice of Sanity's remarks </p><p> </p><p>Your advice might be o.k. for much lower prescriptions with less than 1.0 diopter of myopia, but less with astigmatism- </p><p> </p><p>Astigmatism is a lens deformation, and the eye tries to cope with that deformation using certain muscles, and it can not compensate for it. When the lens is correcting this deformation, the eye (these muscles) can relax. You can not only see better, but a cause of headaches is gone as well. I know this from my first glasses with an astigmatism of then 1.50 from own experience. </p><p> </p><p>When Jennifer wants to avoid headaches, and fulfill certain vision requirements (e.g driving) there is no solution without vision correction for her! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2018, 10:52</p><p>Hello Jennifer, my best wishes and gratulations.  </p><p> </p><p>Your prescription is not dramatic, it is what the experts say, a 'low' prescription. But on the other hand, it is quite substantial, and, as you agree now, without glasses you just see nothing compared to wearing your glasses. </p><p> </p><p>For example, without your glasses, you can't see that a fence is a fence - it might have been all over the years a greyish surface, but not a fence. So I understood from your writing, that you are quite happy with your glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Don't be afraid, there might be not very much increase over the years to come, and the astigmatism might very well stabilize and not grow, just the myopia (nearsighted) might increase a bit, but not too much - this is my opinion.And still, this prescription gives a very nice looking and attractive appearance to young ladies, at least this is my preference (between -2.00 and - 6.00 or -7.00).  </p><p> </p><p>So all the best, and happy Easter holidays!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2018, 19:47</p><p>Jennifer </p><p> Congratulations on being a newbie glasses girl ! </p><p> I am glad that your adjustment  period went well. </p><p> In about six months or so, you may notice that you are not seeing quite as well as you are now. That is totally normal, as many times the optometrist will slightly under correct you, to aid is getting used to a first time correction, or sometimes it is just that your eyes get a bit worse. When that happens, be sure to have another exam, and then the adjustment to the new glasses will not be as drastic, as with your first pair. </p><p> Depending on your age, you certainly can look forward to a few increases to your prescription over the next few years.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2018, 14:21</p><p>Jennifer </p><p>Glad to hear that your eyes have adjusted to your glasses and that you're mow comfortable wearing them. It's normal when your first pair of glasses has quite a bit of astigmatism correction that it can often take several days for your eyes to fully adjust to your  prescription. I'm sure that everything looks a lot more blurred now when you take off your glasses that it was before you got your glasses. Before you were aided by something called accommodation. But what it really means is that your brain was helping you see better than you really could. Now after wearing your glasses for a week your eyes are much more relaxed and not using any accommodation and your not straining your eyes trying to see things anymore.  </p><p>So if you don't mind my asking why did you put off getting glasses for so long? You seem to have clearly known that you needed to be wearing glasses for quite a while. Was it just that you didn't want to be seen wearing glasses or something else? Since you got your glasses and have been wearing them have you gotten lots of nice complements on how good you look wearing glasses? I'm betting that you have. Are you sorry that you didn't get glasses much sooner instead of putting it off? You really do seem to be enjoying being avle to see so good now.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2018, 09:20</p><p>It has been a week, and I now feel comfortable with my glasses. I notice how bad my eyesight is more now because the difference between having my glasses on and off. Before I had nothing to compare to.  </p><p>The glasses are great, I can actually see small and far away things for the first time in such a long time! </p><p>I no longer see the imaginary steps or slanted letters which is great. I had no idea vision was supposed to be this good.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NNVisitor</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2018, 22:41</p><p>Jennifer </p><p> </p><p>It will certainly take time to get used to wearing your glasses. You have a lot of astigmatism in addition to being nearsighted. Hopefully in time you will have adjusted to them. See how it goes during the next week-two weeks. If you absolutely cannot adjust to them after 10 days or so have the eye doctor you went to check your glasses. If you are told that they were done correctly and you still cannot adjust to them then consider getting contact lenses. Contact lenses take time to get used to as you would have to learn how to insert them, take them out and disinfect and store them using the appropriate solutions. Also at first you will feel them on your eyes. Vision typically is great with contact lenses and what you see will be more natural than what you see with glasses. Glasses are easier to deal with as contact lenses do in fact touch your eyes and even if you are tired in the evening you still must take them out using good hygene techniques and properly cleaning and storing them. Never sleep in contact lenses. Good luck Jennifer on whatever you decide to do.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2018, 21:13</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p>  I totally agree.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2018, 10:53</p><p>Voice of San </p><p>My comments to Jennifer is based on what is fact in her case. If she had only been prescribed with say -.50 glasses for distance I would maybe suggest that she wear her glasses for a week to 10 days so she gets used to wearing glasses and so her eyes could adjust. And then she could wear her glasses as needed. But her prescription is considerably stronger than that and she really needs to be wearing glasses full time now based strictly on her prescription and not because I simply want her to wear glasses. If you knew anything about optics you would know that adjusting to a rather high cylinder isn't that easy and the only way to adjust is by wearing your glasses as much as possible. Yes, in the end between her nearsightedness and astigmatisms she is almost certainly going to want and need to continue wearing her glasses full time. Of course if she wants doesn't want top wear glasses she can opt for contacts, But for her she would need "toric lenses" which are considerably more expensive than regular contacts. Actually about 3 or 4 times more expensive. That's totally up to her.  </p><p>You're right this forum is about glasses but sometimes the advice provided is based on fact and not fetish.     </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Voice of Sanity</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2018, 08:26</p><p>Jennifer </p><p> </p><p>Glasses simply change the way light is refracted to your eyes.  It has largely been proven that wearing glasses regularly won't change the physical structure of the eye.  It is physically impossible to do that.  So the arguments that you need to keep wearing glasses are spurious.   </p><p> </p><p>I suggest you disregard the damnations here to constantly wear your glasses.  This is a glasses fetish website where people whack off to women who wear glasses.  Do you think they would tell you to stop wearing glasses?  Of course not.  If you don't want to wear your glasses, you will be just as fine as wearing your glasses.  Nothing will change.  Don't worry.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2018, 14:01</p><p>Jennifer  </p><p>It sounds like you're already tolerating your glasses a bit more than when you first put them on? Unless you have already been wearing your glasses all day which if you have then just continue to wear them. But if you aren't currently wearing them then it probably isn't a good idea wearing them in the car on the way to the theater. but once you get seated and not moving around you should put your glasses and hopefully it's a a movie that will keep your interest and you won't even think about your glasses being on. When the movie ends and your hopefully still wearing your glasses try keeping them on the rest of the evening. If you keep them on for the entire movie that should be close to 2 hours and by then your eyes should be feeling a lot more comfortable wearing glasses. Good luck and enjoy the movie.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2018, 12:10</p><p>Thank you guys, I will try keeping them on while I go to the movies tonight. Hopefully they will help.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2018, 10:08</p><p>Jennifer </p><p>You have needed glasses for a while. Your eyesight isn't terrible  but it is for this being your first prescription. Your distance part of your prescription is the first numbers in each row of numbers. So your right eye your distance vision is -1.25 and your left eye is -1.50 so more than bad enough that you shouldn't be driving a car which I hope you weren't. The other numbers are your astigmatism numbers and normally those numbers are usually much lower. Usually around -.50 or -.75 is average. So you are considerably past those numbers. That's why you're having so much trouble adjusting to your glasses. So unfortunately the only way to adjust is by forcing yourself to keep your glasses on. Like Likelenses said find something where you're not changing focus with your eyes. Things like reading is good or sitting watching TV is also fine. The more you move around and look at something in the distance and then look at something close the more your glasses are going to bother you. Trust me once your eyes adjust you won't have this problem again. Likelenses is right once you need to be wearing your glasses full time and once your eyes adjust I don't think your going to want to be without your glasses anymore.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2018, 22:23</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Jennifer  </p><p> To get used to your new glasses, it would help if you pit them on, and read a book for a few hours. </p><p> Most likely you will find them very comfortable for reading. You may feel a need to push the book farther away than what you would usually read at, and that is good, but try to hold it no closer than twelve inches. </p><p> After a few hours or reading things in the distance should not be so distorted.

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2018, 22:09</p><p>Jennifer </p><p> You are nearsighted, but you also have a boatload of astigmatism in each eye. </p><p> The astigmatism correction is what is making it difficult to adjust to your glasses. </p><p> I agree with Soundmanpt on the importance of leaving them on. </p><p> When you do get used to them, you will need them all the time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2018, 20:03</p><p>Jennifer </p><p>I wish that you would have asked for a copy of your prescription because that would really be a huge help in providing you with advice. But I have a few questions that you may know the answers to which could be of help. First of all when you went to get your eyes examined were you having some type of vision problem or was your exam just an annual checkup which found that you needed to start wearing glasses? Did the doctor say anything about your having astigmatisms? Your reactions to your glasses really seems like what some people experience when they get prescribed with their first astigmatism prescription.  </p><p>I can tell you one thing for sure. Going back now their only going to tell you that your eyes need to adjust to your glasses and that you should wear them constantly for the week to 14 days. Then if you're still having issues with your glasses you should come back and they will check things out. Honestly about 99% of the time they are right and by wearing your glasses your eye swill adjust and you will be seeing fine with them. So I would suggest as soon as you open your eyes tomorrow morning that you put your glasses right away and keep them on as long as possible. All day into the evening if possible. but if you do need to take them off to rest your eyes put them back on as soon  as possible. Do that every day and I think you''re going to find that each day your glasses re going to work better and better for you.   </p><p></p><hr>

If the prescription is a low one some say wear them for driving, TV and movies while others yet say to wear them all the time. When patients already are wearing glasses and get an increase often the examining doctor hands them a prescription with no advice on wearing time. </p><p> </p><p>In any event some people religiously follow their eye doctor's advice as to wearing their glasses. Others partly or completely ignore the advice. I have seen no evidence that wearing or not wearing one's glasses all waking hours if myopic will make one's eyesight worse.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Opt O. Metrist</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2018, 05:47</p><p>You are wrong this time, Cactus Jack.  No one should ever wear glasses that much time during the day.  Not every waking moment.  We always recommend giving your eyes a break from glasses at least once everyday.  This is the problem with pseudo-eye doctors here.  Their advice differs from actual medical advice, while appreciated, it's much preferable to listen to the latter.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2018, 01:18</p><p>Jake, </p><p>You should wear your glasses from the time you wake up, until you go to bed. </p><p>You are pretty nearsighted or shortsighted the Medical term is Myopia.  Lots of people have Myopia it is corrected by the 1st number in your prescription using Minus lenses.  Let me explain your prescription: </p><p>By tradition, the top row is for your Right Eye. Sometimes it will be designated as OD (Oculus Dexter) (from the Latin). </p><p>OD Sphere -3.50, Cylinder -1.5, Axis 135 degrees, Prism 6, BO (Base Out) </p><p>The bottom row is your Left Eye. Sometimes it is designated as OS (Oculus Sinister) </p><p>OS Sphere -2.75, Cylinder -1.25, Axis 100degrees, Prism 6, BO (Base Out). </p><p>Sphere, in your prescription, corrects your Myopia which is usually caused by your eyeballs growing a little too much.  More about that later. </p><p>Cylinder corrects what is called Astigmatism.  Astigmatism is a bit hard to understand, but it messes up your vision at all distances, near and far.  It is usually caused by your Cornea, that is the clear part of your eye that is the first part you see.  If you can imagine this, it should be evenly shaped like a slice from the side of a glass marble or sphere.  If you have Astigmatism the curvature is not even.  It is a steeper curve in one direction than it is in the other.  Image a glass American Football.  Astigmatism would look like a slice from the side of the glass football. </p><p>The Axis is the direction of the Long Axis of the Cylinder.  By tradition, the 0 degree Axis is Horizontal.  If you are looking at the glasses wearer, the degrees increase in a Counter or Anti Clockwise direction to 90 degrees is Vertical and one around to 180 degrees (same as 0).  By tradition, Axis numbers are NOT specified above 180 degrees. </p><p>Prism corrects you problem of seeing double or two images.  Your eyes tend to turn inward or converge or cross.  It is likely related to your very significant Myopia.  More about that Later. </p><p>The Base Out (BO) specifies the direction of the Base of the Prism correction.  You may have seen a prism in science class in school.  Prisms can do a lot of things.  One of which is break up white light into the spectrum of colors.  It can also help you NOT see two images. Called fusing the images. </p><p>I would like to as you a few questions that will hep me explain how your vision works if you are interested. </p><p>1. Your age? </p><p>2. What is your grade or level in school? </p><p>3. Where do you live? Country and State or Province) </p><p>4. Have you taken any Math or Science classes? </p><p>I understand that you are concerned about wearing glasses.  Almost everyone is apprehensive about getting glasses. Really, glasses are just tools to help you see better. There will be some questions and perhaps comments.  Also, your siblings or friends will be curious and want to try them. That will only last a couple of days and that will be the end of it.  Once other people are used to you wearing glasses, the only comment you will get is if you get a different frame style.  If you get a prescription change, but keep the same frame style, they probably won't even notice. </p><p>You are in for a BIG surprise when you get your glasses.  Without your glasses, everything beyond about 30 cm or 12 inches is pretty blurry.  You can probably read or use a computer if you hold the book close or get close to the display. The reason your eye are trying to turn inward or converge is because you are used to holding things very close. </p><p>When you put on your glasses for the first time. You are going to see things that you have not seen clearly in a long time.  Frankly, things may look a little distorted until you get used to wearing them.  The reason for this is that Vision actually occurs in your brain,  Your eyes are just biological cameras and they have been delivering distorted images to your brain and your brain has been fixing them for you. It will take your brain a few days to learn how to deal with images that are in focus.  Don't let it worry you. </p><p>One thing that may happen, because your eyes are not used to having to focus close, you may have trouble at first reading or using a computer.  Close things may be blurry.  If that happens, there are ways to fix that until your Auto-Focus System (yes you have one) learns how to work again.  </p><p>Having Myopia can mean that your focusing muscles have not had to do any work for a long time and they may be very weak and unable to focus.  If you experience that, please let me know and I may be able to offer some suggestions. </p><p>Do you know what your siblings prescriptions are? </p><p>When are your glasses supposed to be ready? </p><p>There is lots more to learn about vision. You have a great adventure ahead of you. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jake</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2018, 22:11</p><p>Hello </p><p>My siblings and I just got our first glasses a couple of days ago. I would like to know if you guys think I should wear them all the time or not. The doctor did not specify, nor did I remember to ask. He gave us or prescruptions, not quite sure what they mean. However, I do know that I apparently have the worst eyesight of all of us (my younger brother asked). The doctor was pretty shocked I did not already have glasses. I knew once I was asked to read the chart that I must have bad eyesight because I could only see black on the white at the top, but could not make out the "E." It kind of just looked like a black line. I also have a question about the part when the doctor opebs both eyes and asks if you see one or two images. After asking my siblings I realized I was the only one who saw two, also my siblings said their exam ended after that. Mine kept going with this long test using a bar and the doctor kept covering one eye and then the other again and again. My question is why did I see two while my siblings saw one? Also was the test part after that because I saw two? I kind of always wanted glasses, but now that I have them I am kind of nervous about wearing them. The numbers on my prescription chart are as follows: top row -3.5, -1.5, 135, 6, BO and the bottom row is -2.75, -1.25, 100, 6, BO.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glasses Lover</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2017, 12:14</p><p>Where do I start? Wow! Just experienced my first foray into bifocals; and I must say the experience is exhilarating! Let me start by going over my background. Failed my vision screening in the 5th grade and subsequently went to an optometrist and was diagnosed with nearsightedness. No surprise there! I wanted glasses so bad I was so happy on the inside that my eyes were nearsighted. Was prescribed glasses for distance only and parents did not want me wearing them. This went on for about 18 months when my mom made a comment about me squinting at the tv and told me I should consider wearing my glasses. Even though I wanted to so bad I was reluctant to wear them outside of the house. I continued to struggle with reading the blackboard at school but did finally get another exam and needed a stronger prescription. I finally had to use them part-time at school now. This went on for another couple years and in between wearings I found myself squinting heavily to see. Finally, before freshman year I got contacts and wore those for many, many years and still do today when doing any physical activities, although I still have a fetish for glasses. Especially, thick, strong glasses. I loved my annual exams knowing I would get a stronger prescription and thicker glasses.  Unfortunately, I plataeued around -4.5. I longed for for eyes to get more nearsighted and necessitate Coke bottle lenses but that did not happen. Then came the experiments with over correction and I quickly found out I can tolerate quite a bit of minus and still see just fine. After several pairs and half a decade at age 39, I found myself able to accommodate over correction of minus but when doing so close vision became increasingly poor. So...my actual prescription: </p><p> </p><p>OD: -4.25 -0.25 109 </p><p>OS: -4.75 -0.50 171 </p><p> </p><p>My glasses I've worn for the past couple years: </p><p> </p><p>OD: -5.00 -0.25 109 </p><p>OS: -5.75 -0.50 171 </p><p> </p><p>And now...my latest that I received from Firmoo yesterday: </p><p> </p><p>OD: -6.50 -0.25 109 </p><p>OS: -7.00 -0.50 171 </p><p>+1.00 read </p><p> </p><p>Vision is perfect! Distance has been the clearest I've ever remembered! Almost HD like and bright and vibrant! Read add makes print easy to read. Bifocals we're easy to adjust to as they sit on my face now and I'm looking thru the add portion of the lens as I write this on my mobile device.  </p><p> </p><p>The lens are a regular 1.50 index so there is decent thickness to them and they stick out of the frame quite a bit with plenty of power rings and the lined bifocal is pretty obvious as well!  </p><p> </p><p>I'm hooked and already thinking about another order with more minus. I'm able to tolerate this just fine and thinking about bumping my next script to: </p><p> </p><p>OD: -7.50 -0.25 109 </p><p>OS: -8.00 -0.50 171 </p><p>+1.50 read </p><p> </p><p>What is everyone's thoughts? I'm excited and for the first time ever I can walk around with a fairly substantial lens thickness that would indicate to most people that I'm very nearsighted (which is what I want to portray.) The thought of having a -8.00 thickness is making me feel anxious in ordering it already! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NNVisitor</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2017, 23:26</p><p>NewGlassesTrouble </p><p> </p><p>The distortion is caused by three things. The power of the glasses, your astigmatism correction and because the front of the lens is flat instead of curved the distortion is much worse. </p><p>Because you have double vision you need to go back to the person who tested your eyes and tell them about your double vision and the distortion problems with the glasses. In high prescriptions the only clear vision is through the center of the lenses. If you were to wear contact lenses you would no longer see everthing as small nor would you have the distortion you experience now. As far as I am aware contact lenses won't correct double vision. Only glasses will. This means that if you wore only one contact lens at a time you would only see one clear image but it is difficult because your clear vision is limited to one eye. You could alternate which eye you wear the contact lens in. With two contact lenses both eyes would see things much larger without distortion but you would still have double vision. </p><p>If you get your glasses redone with prisms to end you double vision things would still appear small and you would still have distortion. </p><p>It is rare to have glasses these days that are flat in the front. That is how they used to be made for about -9 or higher but these days even prescriptions much higher are still curved in the front but only a little curvature. Making the front of the lenses flat has made the distortion much worse. </p><p>How do you rate the new glasses that you are trying to adjust to? 1 You're disappointed with them. 2 You are very disappointed with them. 3 You utterly hate them. </p><p>If you are unhappy with the person who examined your eyes you may be better off going to a different one who works in a different place to explain your double vision and your new glasses problems.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NewGlassesTrouble</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2017, 16:55</p><p>I am not sure if I have completly adjusted. Other than the smallness making it hard to read everything still looks distorted especially when looking through the sides. I have had these glasses since Friday. I have never worn contacts. The double vision is always there, and everywhere does not matter of I am reading, or looking at a board. From what I remember it started sometime around the second year with my old glasses so about 4 years ago. It was before that second missed appointment.  </p><p>I hope I answered all your questions.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NNVisitor</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2017, 22:56</p><p>NewGlassesTrouble </p><p> </p><p>Have you yet adjusted to your new glasses for seeing objects and people at a distance? Can you list any problems you still have wearing your new glasses other than the smaller image size? </p><p> </p><p>My own prescription is somewhat similar to yours and I also wound up with a large prescription increase because I waited years before getting new glasses. My increase was large but yours is an even greater increase. I completely understand your adjustment problems. May I ask how long you have now been wearing your new glasses? Also have you ever worn contact lenses? </p><p> </p><p>Do you have double vision every day? Seeing distant objects and people? Is it just temporary for less than a minute or all day long? How many years have you noticed having double vision? </p><p> </p><p>One more thing. If you have worn your new glasses for over a week or two weeks and you feel you cannot adjust to them they can redo the glasses for the same prescription using a curved front and a more curved backside of the lenses. They may not want to and will say the prescription is correct. If you are unhappy with these glasses then you should adamantly stand up for your rights and say that you did some research and found out that the base curve used is causing your problems and that the glasses are impossible to adjust to. Before you make this request, if you absolutely feel you cannot adjust to these new glasses, please let us know here about whether your double vision problems last more than briefly each day as you may also need a prism correction.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NewGlassesTrouble</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2017, 19:22</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p>The double vision is kind of just always there, has been for some years now. It is like what I described happened after about a minute of the doctor opening both my eyes in the exam.  </p><p>If the reading will get better on it's own I will probably just wait it out.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2017, 14:48</p><p>NewGlassesTrouble, </p><p>Are you having any trouble with double vision now, with your new glasses, for distance or when you focus close? </p><p>If you are having any discomfort when you focus close for using the computer or reading, the obvious thing is to consider bifocals or trifocals.  I would like to suggest a temporary alternative that you can easily stop using as your Ciliary Muscles regain their strength. </p><p>The alternative is Clip-On Magnifiers.  They are not very expensive.  I suggest checking out the rx-safety.com web site.  Look under Reading and Magnifying&gt;Clip-on Magnifiers.  They come in two sizes depending on your frame size.  They are available in powers ranging from +1.00 to +5.00.  I suggest getting 3 powers +1.00, +1.50, and +2.00.  The idea is to use the least power you can for the close task you are doing and and the distance to the target.  The clue is comfort.  While a stronger lens may be the most comfortable, ou don't want the magnifiers to do all the work for your Ciliary Muscles.  You need to start with the muscles doing a little work and then gradually increase their workload until you not longer need them.  It may take a few weeks or a month. </p><p>Rx-Safety had a special running with a 20% discount in you used the promo code MIDSUMMER17.  The Ciip-on magnifiers are regularly about $15 each and with a 20% discount, 3 pair would be $36.  </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NewGlassesTrouble</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2017, 11:31</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p>Thanks for getting back to me. To answer your questions, I live in the US, and my exam was with a local doctor, and I know of a few sites to order glasses, thanks though. As for the helping with reading, what do you suggest? Should I call the doctor and tell him about how I saw two charts? What do you suggest? What happened was it was like I saw one with each eye for about a minute, and then they mostly came together and it was like one image with another right next to it and slightly overlapping. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2017, 08:37</p><p>NewGlassesTrouble, </p><p>The optical power of a lens is the difference in the curvature of the front and back surface of the lens. </p><p>Minus lenses of less than -8.00 (it varies a little depending on the complete prescription) are typically made with a + front surface to minimize the apparent size of any reflections, others see.  The reflections will appear smaller than actual size.  If the front surface is +1.00 and the Sphere correction is say -6.00, the back surface will need to be -7.00. </p><p>Somewhere, along about -8.00, It becomes desirable to reduce the curvature of the front surface to 0.00 (flat front) minimize the amount of - curvature needed in the back surface of the lens.  As the curvature of the front surface of the lens becomes less, the reflections from that surface become much larger and more noticeable to others.  The best solution for the reflection problems with flat front lenses is an Anti-Reflective coating. (more about that later). </p><p>It is likely that your glasses were made correctly, but it is possible that there was an error.  It does occasionally happen. </p><p>With that much of an increase in your Sphere correction and the length of time you have been wearing your old prescription, I suspect the examiner expected you to have some problems focusing close.  I can guarantee that you are NOT becoming farsighted, but you could be experiencing some of the symptoms of Presbyopia with your new glasses. </p><p>I mentioned that in a previous post, but let me expand on that a little.  Almost everyone develops Presbyopia (literally Old Eyes) at some point in their life.  Presbyopia actually starts in childhood, but typically does not become a nuisance until your late 30s or early 40s where you need some additional PLUS or LESS MINUS in your glasses to help you focus close. </p><p>True Presbyopia is caused by the gradual stiffening of your Crystalline Lenses to the point where your Ciliary Muscles can no longer squeeze the Crystalline Lenses to increase their PLUS power.  You Ciliary Muscles and your Crystalline Lenses are the variable focus ("auto-focus") elements in your eyes that allow you focus at all distances.  Assuming your distance vision is corrected to 0.00, you actually cannot see anything closer than 20 feet or 6 meters without some additional PLUS in the optical system from somewhere.   </p><p>The formula for calculating the additional PLUS was developed by Sir Isaac Newton (of gravity fame) around 1700.  The formula is simple, but it ALWAYS applies, there are NO exceptions.  Lens Power = 1 meter, 100 cm, or 39.37 inches divided by the Focus Distance (in the same units of measure).  To focus at a typical reading distance of 40 cm or 16 inches requires +2.50 diopters from somewhere.  If your auto-focus system still works properly, you can easily supply the +2.50 internally. But, if Presbyopia has reared its head, you may need some external PLUS (e.g. Reading Glasses or Bifocals) to supply some the PLUS needed. </p><p>At your age, it is unlikely that Presbyopia has progressed enough to cause focusing issues.  However, the idea that focusing help is not needed until 40 is a myth.  Close focusing can become a problem at any age.  How rapidly your Crystalline Lenses become too stiff to do their job depends on genetics. </p><p>A more common reason for needing close focusing help in people who are Myopic, is de-conditionong of the Ciliary Muscles.  A person who is Myopic effectively has "built-in" reading glasses.  The PLUS power of those built-in glasses is approximately the opposite sign of the glasses power.  IOW, if a person needs -2.50 glasses for distance, his built-in "eye power" is +2.50.  Vertex Distance effects alter that statement a bit, your built-in PLUS is about +9.00 (astigmatism makes it a bit more) so your focus distance without glasses is about 11 cm or a bit over 4 inches. </p><p>Because you avoided getting an eye exam for so long, it is very likely that your Ciliary Muscles are very weak.  Making it seem like a strain to focus to read right now.  The good news is that by using your Ciliary Muscles they will get stronger and close focusing will be easier.  However, the weigh lifting thing I mentioned is applicable here and you may need a little help until the muscles get stronger.  I can help with that if you are having problems. </p><p>It was a mistake to not mention that you were seeing double, even briefly.  You could have some muscle imbalance or eye alignment issues that are complicating your situation.  I suspect that any mis-alignment is small and your Eye Position Control System (PCS) (my name) can easily deal with it, without any correction in your glasses.  However, the EPCS needs good images at its primary input so it can track properly.  Blurry images make it difficult.  If a person has some mis-alignment, it may be desirable to prescribe a bit of prism correction to help keep the images fused.  It depends on several factors that are too complex to discuss here. </p><p>I hope this has helped answer some of your questions. </p><p>It may be desirable to get a re-check of your glasses and a prescription check to ease your mind about your glasses.  Before you get another eye exam, I suggest reading a piece I wrote "Hot to Study for an Eye Exam".  It might be helpful. </p><p>I am in the process of updating and editing it and I should be able to post it in the next day or so. </p><p>Another couple of questions. </p><p>1. May I ask where you live (country)? </p><p>2. Did you get your exam at a large chain or an independent ECP? </p><p>3. Would you be interested in learning how to order glasses online for a lot less money? </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NewGlassesTrouble</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2017, 20:37</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p>I am a female, in my second year of college studying History and Psychology. I got my last glasses early in the summer before my freshman year of high school. For the next two years something either came up with me or my doctor and I had to miss my appointment and never rescheduled. Also around this time I started becoming very self conscious about my glasses and eyesight, and did not want to be told my eyesight got worse or that I needed an increase in my prescription, so I was glad when I missed those appointments and never wanted to go again because I was scared. I was fine until spring of last school year I started noticing I was having some trouble seeing the people sitting next to me's notes without hardcore squinting, glasses pushing, and moving closer. I never had problems with boards until this school year which is why I finally got my eyes checked, plus glasses were way outdated style wise and they were dirty and the color was coming off. I transferred to a new school and even sitting second row I had a really hard time seeing what my professors were writing and no amount of squinting or glasses pushing was helping. Before that I was in a small college where the fornt row and the board were usually within 5 feet of each other, and I am a front row to third row sitter. </p><p>Back to my original post, do you think the glasses are made correctly because the lenses look different and are not curved? Also, do you know why my doctor would check my near vision, am I also farsighted now? And lastly, the almost before the end of the end of the examinatiin the doctor opened both my eyes and asked if I saw one or two images. I felt like one was the correct answer so I said one even though I saw two for about a minute before they mainly became one. What is the point of that question? Why was I never asked thag or to read the near chart before?  </p><p>Sorry for being so long and boring yoh with my story. I know it's pretty silly, but that's the truth.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2017, 16:42</p><p>NewGlassesTroubles. </p><p>It is amazing that you were able to go for 5 1/2 years without a prescription change.  As I said, it is like getting your first pair of glasses and it is going to take some adjustment and getting used to them. </p><p>Vision actually occurs in the brain, your eyes are merely biological cameras.  Your brain has the ability to correct the images delivered to it, IF it knows what something is supposed to look like.  In many ways, your brain is a biological computer and it develops Algorithms to do image correction.  Your brain is used to working with the images corrected by your old glasses. With that much increase, images will look smaller and if there was a change in your Astigmatism correction, images will look distorted until it develops a new image processing Algorithm. </p><p>I am not the least surprised that you are having some difficulty with reading.  If this prescription is correct, your old glasses were like wearing very strong reading glasses with about +4.00.  It is very likely that your Ciliary Muscles (focusing muscles) are VERY weak and are having difficulty focusing to read.  For their size (very tiny) your Ciliary Muscles are the strongest muscles in the body, but like all muscles, they get weak if you don't use them.  With your old glasses you probably have not been using them hardly at all. </p><p>You can get them in condition simply by using them to focus, but it may not be pleasant.  In some ways it is like going to the gym and starting weight lifting with very heavy weights, it is painful and there are much better and more effective ways. </p><p>Some while back we had a 17 YO poster who had just received his first glasses of about -3.50.  He could not focus enough with them to use a computer or read.  The solution was temporary trifocals of moderate Add.  That allowed is Ciliary Muscles to go to work, but not work as hard, until they became stronger and eventually he was able to just wear single vision glasses. </p><p>May I ask a few questions? </p><p>1. Your Gender? </p><p>2, Your Occupation?  If a student, what are you studying? </p><p>3. How were you able to go for so long without new glasses? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

I have been here way long to be bullied away.  </p><p>I only believed that May 1st post because the photo of the glasses was in fact taken in front of that same amplifier in several other pictures of glasses that you did post earlier. But some just reposted one of those older pictures of a pair of glasses. I am really glad to hear that post wasn't from you because I had promised you that wearing all those stronger glasses wouldn't have any effect on your actual eyesight. So it really made me feel bad when I read that wearing those glasses had caused a rather big change in your eyesight and you were wearing glasses full time. It was surprising because just as I had told you because of your age wearing stronger glasses shouldn't have had any effect on your actual eyesight. So I am very glad to hear that you recently got your eyes examined and their was no change in your prescription.  </p><p>Now that you moved it should be no problem at all with wearing whatever glasses you want anytime you want without anyone having any reason to question you about your glasses.

I had a few hard times, also moved home, have been working a lot, and didn't have any urge to share my experiences with glasses, as I got a little tired of all the accusations and insults being almost the only feedback to my comments. I've been reading a bit, but haven't posted for a while. I see the hostile climate around here keeps going on, but fuck it. </p><p> </p><p>That "María" that posted on May 1st isn't me. The photo they used I uploaded it on October 2016. It's way older than the posting. My vision remains stable at -0,5 -0.75 (I had an exam last month), so I just keep wearing every now and them some of the glasses I bougth. </p><p> </p><p>About that, my collection has grown up, but lately I've been donating some of the pairs I didn't like using an app where people share stuff that they don't want but can be useful to others. I even bought, out of curiosity, a cheap used lensmeter so I could know the prescription of the glasses I buy... and the ones I have been giving away. I have some nice stories about that, I expect to write about it as soon as I have a little time. Also, I'll post photos of my new pairs.

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2017, 00:41</p><p>JMB, </p><p> </p><p>In the Netherlands we have a new chain called Eyelove. Their glasses are just below 50 euro and there is no extra charge if your prescription is high. They use 1.67 lenses for high prescriptions at no extra cost. Another advantage is that they can measure exactly what your lens thickness will be. It worked perfectly for a -12 prescription and the lenses (in a fairly large frame) were 6,7 mm thick, exactly as calculated. Eyelove is worth considering if they are active in your country as well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>antonio</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2017, 22:11</p><p>Hi JMB, </p><p> </p><p>as you probably know edge thickness increases with width of your lenses. So another possibility to reduce it would be to choose a frame with a width of less than 53 mm. Probably you don't want to, I see :-) </p><p> </p><p>Best regards, antonio</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2017, 08:01</p><p>JMB </p><p>I have quite a bit of experience with ordering glasses from Zenni. Over the past 13 years or so I have ordered well over several hundred pairs of glasses in various prescriptions. Mostly under -3.50 but several higher than that. One young lady I recall very well that wanted a semi-rimless frame and her rx was -4.50 in both eyes with some CYL as well. She insisted that she was only going to wear her glasses at night after taking her contacts off. So she didn't want to pay extra for high index lenses. I was surprised at how nice her glasses turned out even with the 1.56 lenses. Now of course you're a full diopter stronger. Have you considered going with the the 1.61 option which is only $19.00 extra? That should keep your lenses from looking like Coke bottle bottoms. I have have never had even one bad experience with Zenni's accuracy for the prescription being perfect. When you are placing your order it is going to recommend that you get the higher index lenses but you simple over ride it and click on the 1.61 option or the 1.56 if you decide to go that way.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JMB</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2017, 00:31</p><p>Hi guys, </p><p> </p><p>I'm ordering glasses online (Zenni) and would like a bit of guidance. My prescription is -5.50 in both eyes. I'd like to get a half-rim frame, as my current ones are full-rim metal and I look like a geeky high-schooler. I have my eyes set on a frame that has a 53 mm width. I plugged in the numbers, and 1.56 index would end up around 6.5mm thick -- but it is really cheap and I'm on a limited budget. However I don't want to walk around in coke bottles (yes, I'm a lurker on this site but want to look presentable). Will that thickness look awful? Should I shell out some more for high-index? And generally, can Zenni be trusted for prescription accuracy, measurements, etc? Thanks a lot in advance. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>newglasseswearer</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2017, 09:09</p><p>Hi everyone, </p><p> </p><p>I posted this on the VISION thread but thought I might as well post it here too because the title of this thread is NEW GLASSES. </p><p> </p><p>Yesterday, I got my first pair of glasses and I cannot believe how clear everything is! Now I actually want to watch TV because I can see everything on it! Also everything is so bright and colors are so vivid. Like i know everyone says this when they get glasses but can you believe it... there are leaves on trees?!!! It usually is all just one giant blob for me. School was one of the hardest times of my life as I literally could not copy down what the teacher was writing on the board even from the front row no matter how hard I squinted. Sometimes I would have to literally walk up to the board like about 6 inches away to see it clearly and it was really embarrassing but I didn't know how to copy down the notes another way. But anyways, I got my first pair yesterday around 4 pm. And when I tried them on in the store, I was BLOWN AWAY! I could see all the glasses around me in FULL detail! Then I took them off because my mom says that if I wear them often, my vision will deteriorate. Ugh it sucked when I took them off cause I literally could not see anything again. Then we went outside to walk to my mom's car and I put them on for a quick second and again I WAS BLOWN AWAY! (This was when I noticed the leaves on trees and people's faces from miles away!) My mom then said I could wear them on the way home to see what I was missing out on and I did and OMG in the car ride, I could see the time on the screen up front from the BACK ROW! I could also see road signs and wow it was quite an awakening. Then, when I got home, I took them off and everything was a BLUR! When I went to watch the TV, I decided to test out my glasses, and WOW IT WAS AMAZING! I could actually see letters on the screen and details of EVERYTHING! And I looked around my house and I could see so many details like the lines within my wooden floor! Went for a walk myself and everything was so clear and detailed and ughhhh I didn't realize how much i was missing out. But then I saw my friend from school and I was a little embarrassed to be wearing my glasses as I have never worn glasses till now. I can't wait to test them out at school on Monday but I'm a little afraid. I think I'm going to have to break the news to my mom that I will have to wear my glasses full time because I literally CANNOT see anything. I even have to wear them to see my computer clearly and in HD. </p><p> </p><p>BTW, the doctor said my prescription is -3.25 in both eyes. Don't really know what that means but he said it was a super strong prescription for a first pair of glasses and now I can see why he said that! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 May 2017, 15:34</p><p>SB </p><p>Everyone sees differently even with the exact same prescription. I can only answer you by saying that many if not most usually go to full time wear at about -1.50. And you need to also take in consideration the astigmatisms you also have which also adds on a bit. But like you know there is no glasses police so how much you decide or feel the need to wear your glasses is totally up to you with the exception of driving of course which you already were doing anyway.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>everything's fuzzy</b>&nbsp;24 May 2017, 20:24</p><p>I was at a nightspot a few years back. There was this blond about 25 y-o and 5'5", a tad overweight but very attractive and wearing plus prescription eyeglasses. An female acquaintance of hers came over to her to ask "Jill, why are you wearing glasses"? Jill replied: they're a new prescription. The acquaintance then asked "what do you have to wear them for"? Jill replied: for seeing. Acquaintance now asks "how do you like them? Jill replies "I hate them" Later that evening I noticed Jill pulling the glasses down her nose trying to see by peering over her frames.  </p><p>A few weeks later Jill was back at the nightspot with several of he girlfriends. But this night she was not wearing glasses. I wondered if she decided not to wear glasses or whether she had contact lenses on. A few minutes passed by and I observed Jill reading a menu without any glasses. I assumed she hated her new glasses enough to get contact lenses. But as I recall from the earlier time that her eyeglasses Rx fairly strong, at maybe +3.00 and she likely had always wore contact lenses in public which is why the acquaintance was so surprised to see Jill wearing Rx glasses. And when Jill informed her that her glasses were a new prescription. That this was not her first time wearing vision correction. She likely wore her new glasses that night because her new contact lenses, the vision correction she prefers,  were still on order.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 May 2017, 12:43</p><p>Stacy </p><p>Sorry Stacy! But it looks like you better get used to the idea that you're going to be wearing glasses like it or not. The fact that they are having you come back in 6 months to examine your eyes again means that you have probably been in need of glasses for some time already. usually a first prescription is pretty weak and you only need to come back after a year. So it sounds like either they didn't give you your full prescription or they feel like your eyes are in transition and you may need an increase by then. But one thing I can tell you is that if the eye chart was blurry now you can expect it to be even more blurred at your next exam.  </p><p>And no there is no way to cheat to not need glasses. There are many things that are far worse than having to wear glasses. Look around at how many of your friends wear glasses. Glasses are really quite popular with many young ladies these days. Have you been into a fashion boutique recently? If so have you not noticed the racks of fake glasses? That's because glasses are now considered a fashion accessory. Just instead of being unhappy about having to wear glasses to take your time in picking out glasses that look good on you. Don't go in with the attitude of just settling for whatever because you're angry.  </p><p>Remember after your eyes get settled down more if you still hate wearing glasses you can always change to contacts.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stacy</b>&nbsp;14 May 2017, 10:10</p><p>Well, found out I need glasses yesterday. If only my dad did not make that appointment I would be fine. And the doctor was kind of rude too, and just had to tell my dad to make sure I wear the glasses all the time. I don't understand why I need glasses. It is not like we look at eye charts all the time, or have to stand 20 feet away from everything we look at, or read at a certain distance. I get along just fine without them, so what if I could not see the letters on the charts. I have to go back in six months, is there anyway to cheat the exam, so that I won't get glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 May 2017, 09:43</p><p>Maria </p><p>First off i'm sure that i'm going to once again be accused of being you but so be it. You know that you are not me and that's all that really matters. I know that you are for sure the same person that was in here several months ago that was buying glasses on E-Bay I believe or other places maybe? I recognize the same amplifier in the background. </p><p>It was becoming clear that you really enjoyed wearing many of the glasses that you were buying and that you getting more and more daring by wearing various pairs even around your own area. At first you would only wear these glasses while in your house and when you got a chance to go to a different town where no one knew you. I remember that your own glasses were only -.75 and you only wore them for driving. You really didn't want your vision to get any worse than that. I know early on you mentioned your age which I don't recall but I know you were past the age where your eyes should have been affected by wearing stronger glasses. I sincerely feel bad for telling you what you were doing was okay and it wouldn't do any harm to your eyes. Apparently by wearing -3.00 glasses constantly during the winter and doing lots of work on your computer and reading was enough to change your eyesight. Were you putting your glasses on each day as soon as you opened your eyes and not taking them off until you went to bed that night? I know you didn't intent to ruin your eyesight when you started buying and wearing those glasses but you seemed to get a thrill out of wearing them as much as possible. Now that you have become a GWG are you okay with wearing glasses full time now?    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2017, 19:03</p><p>ems, </p><p>I have a bit of news that you probably will not like.  Your prescription means that you have built in reading glasses with the strongest power they sell over the counter. </p><p>What that means is that your Focusing Muscles are probably very weak.  The Focusing Muscles are called the Ciliary Muscles.  The inside your eyes and are very tiny. For their size, they are normally the strongest muscles in the body.  Their job is to Squeeze the Crystalline Lenses to increase their power, when you need to focus closer than about 20 feet. </p><p>The reason I wanted to mention this is that I strongly suspect that you will have trouble using your computer screen or reading until your Ciliary Muscles get used to going to work.  In some ways it is like lifting weights to strengthen your arm muscles.  When you start you use very light weights and even with that your muscles get sore.  Your Ciliary Muscles will get sore, but that usually causes headaches. </p><p>Forewarned is Forearmed.  There are several solutions when someone of your age gets their first glasses.  Sometimes the Eye Care Professional will under correct by prescribing LESS Minus than you actually need.  Other times they will prescribe bifocals or in extreme cases trifocals, to let you function until your Ciliary Muscles get strong enough that you no longer need them. </p><p>There are some other temporary solutions that we can help with. </p><p>From a practical standpoint, it will probably take a month or two to get your Ciliary Muscles in shape, but it is important that you not get discouraged. </p><p>If you  are mathematically inclined, I can get into the math and physics of what is going on.  Let me assure you that what you experience is very common for people with first prescriptions over about -2.00.  The good news is that once you get your Ciliary Muscles in shape, you probably won't even need to think about bifocals or progressives for many years. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Apr 2017, 09:16</p><p>Em </p><p>You didn't say what your age is but no matter. The fact that you're getting bifocals in no way has anything to do with your age. You would be surprised at the number of young people, 20 and even younger that are now wearing bifocals. Yes at one time your mother and grandmother usually got their first bifocals sometime after they turned 40. But their eyes weren't subjected to all the things your eyes are subjected to. Computer monitors, I-Phones and hand held games and even the way they are used such as all the texting has taken on toll on nearly everyone's eyes. You just don't know how many are wearing bifocals because they often get no line or progressive glasses. So their glasses appear to be single vision glasses. If you don't want anyone to know that you're wearing bifocals I would suggest that you get progressives as your first bifocals.  </p><p>I will warn you to be extremely careful when you get your bifocals. The floor is going to look like it is waist high when you you look through the reading segment of your bifocals. That can easily cause a nasty fall down steps or even simple curbs. And it is even worse if you wear heels. So once you get your glasses try not to loom down while walking. And of course you will quickly learn that when you're reading you will need to move your eyes only down so they are looking through the reading segment. Once you get your glasses let us know how you're doing with them.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Roy</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2017, 12:36</p><p>I put my new prescription in "Post your Prescription" a few weeks ago when I had an eye test and got some new progressives.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2017, 08:32</p><p>Rebecca </p><p>If you want your lenses to look thick then you want the 1.50 thickness. The 1.57 is a thinner lens option that you clearly don't want. Also when choosing glasses if you want your lenses to really be noticed then you should be looking at semi-rimless glasses. Much like your current glasses. A full frame will cover up much of the lens thickness. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Confused</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2017, 14:47</p><p>Thank you all for your responses. However, I did some actual measuring, and with my glasses on things get blurry at 8 and 13/16 of an inch(average of 5 measurements). It gets impossible to read at 4 and 5/8 of an inch. Lastly, without my glasses on I was able to see okay only 3 and 3/4 of an inch away.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2017, 21:23</p><p>Confused, </p><p>It appears that you have gotten some good answers; however, I think they have not totally addressed your question.  So let me see if I can address your questions so that you get the full story: </p><p> </p><p>It is correct that you have myopia, also known as nearsighted or shortsighted depending on where you live in the world.  Your Rx is fairly strong, represented by the -9.25 and -9.75 which correct for your distance. Because the lenses are concave and relatively strong,  they make things somewhat smaller at all distances. </p><p> </p><p>You also have some astigmatism which affects your vision at all distances which is corrected by the cylinder correction in your Rx. -1.75 X 120 and -1.25 X 85. </p><p> </p><p>Now, attempting to read a phone or book at 2" or 4" is asking a lot of your eyes, that can even be very difficult for persons with 20/20.  Normal reading distances are at about 15" more or less, I may be wrong on the exact number and if so someone  will correct me on that one.  The point; however, is that our eyes were not designed to see things that close to our eyes when we have normal vision of 20/20 and with your glasses you should have 20/20 vision or close to it. </p><p> </p><p>However, for those of us that are myopic, the eyes are not able to focus on distant objects, but because of the shape of the eye which causes the myopia, seeing at very close distances is possible. </p><p> </p><p>So, the long and the short of it is that you should not expect to read at such a close distance with your glasses on, remember that you have a second strike against you because your lenses make things much smaller,  You do have the advantage of removing your glasses and being able to see things at extremely close distances.  In fact, without your glasses you should be able to see small things that most people would need a magnifying glass to see. </p><p> </p><p>I hope this helps you understand your situation, ask more questions if you are still confused.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NNVisitor</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2017, 17:24</p><p>Confused </p><p> </p><p>Your glasses make distance vision better. They also can make it harder to see things very close. Without your glasses you'll see it great.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2017, 10:33</p><p>Confused </p><p>Josh beat me by just a few seconds with his answer. I was about say nearly the exact same thing, that it really helps if know and can provide what the prescription your glasses are. But it does seem that you  are nearsighted (shortsighted). So you really only need your glasses to see distances. That means  that you not only don't need your glasses for close tasks but they are actually working against your eyes a bit. This is why when someone, mostly children, are given glasses for seeing distances they are often told not to wear them for extended time while doing homework or reading. So finding things such as a phone extremely close up with your glasses on being blurry is not unusual for most people. I'm sure threading a needle is much easier without your glasses unless you are able to do it at a normal distance. I see very few times where there should be a need for you to see something 2" or 4" in front of your glasses anyway and if there is and as long as you're able to see it that close without your glasses, then simply takeoff your glasses. It's possible that you're showing very early signs of needing bifocals. Otherwise for now I think that you're eyes and glasses are working just fine if there isn't any other problem with your eyesight. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2017, 10:28</p><p>Lisa </p><p>Your first post back on March 8th you asked if you need glasses based on your prescription. Then you posted that you would just wait to get glasses until your vision in your better eye reached -2.00. Likelenses then suggested that you order glasses now with a -2.00 lens for your better eye which would better balance your eyesight with and without your glasses that way. What he is suggesting would only be speeding up what is likely to happen by holding off getting glasses now in your actual prescription. Antonio or I were suggesting that you get glasses, which is what you asked originally, in the prescription you were given. We were not suggesting that you ruin your vision in your better eye but rather reduce the strain on that eye. Now of course even if you were to get glasses in you actual prescription it's very possible that the vision in your better eye may still deteriorate in that eye because it could be that your eyesight changed more rapidly in the other eye. But as you know you're free to do as you wish.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lisa</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2017, 07:20</p><p>Likelenses, why would I want to ruin my good eye?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NNVisitor</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2017, 23:41</p><p>Lisa you need glasses done in your prescription. Or get fitted with contact lenses. Then wear your glasses or contacts most of each day. It's very important that you do so so that you don't lose the ability to see with the weaker eye. That happened to my father who basically only could see with one eye for most of his life.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2017, 21:20</p><p>Lisa </p><p>  You could order online a pair of glasses with the -2.00 for your bad eye, and an overcorrection  of - 1.50 for your good eye. </p><p>  If you wear these glasses full time for about two weeks, you will have super sharp vision, and it will help your good eye to become balanced closer to that of your bad eye.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lisa</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2017, 19:03</p><p>Thanks, I'm going to wait until my better eye also becomes -2</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2017, 09:32</p><p>Lisa </p><p>There is no doubt at all that you do need to be wearing glasses and you need to be wearing them full time as well. Currently your vision is way out of balance. What Antonio has told you is correct. You're basicly only seeing with your -.25 eye. Your brain is simply turning off your weaker eye when you are looking at anything more than a couple feet away. This of course is putting added strain on your better eye as well. Since you obviously had your eyes examined in order to know what prescription you need for glasses was there a reason you didn't go ahead and pick out glasses right away? I'm sure during the test the doctor showed you how blurry everything was with your weaker eye compared to your better eye. Are you only trying to avoid having to wear glasses? Like Antonio said  at some point not too far off your better eye is sure to weaken and you will be forced to get glasses then for sure. </p><p></p><hr>

And your worse eye could loose the ability to see perhaps as it sees so much blurrier than your better one your brain tends to ignore it, right ? if so you can loose the ability to see with both eyes, eye coordination or so,  </p><p>so I guess you should get yourself some glasses and try them out, </p><p>plus it´s possible your now better eye might follow your weaker eye which would lead you into glasses anyway, right ? </p><p> </p><p>if you like discuss with us on <a href="http://lenschat.com/" target="_blank">http://lenschat.com</a> </p><p> </p><p>best regards, antonio</p><p></p><hr>

Of course you have every right to believe whatever you wish but constantly making claims without any proof at all is so wrong. If you only look back a few comments ago one of the accusers said that Carrie had made comments that were contradictional to herself. All I asked was for him /her to prove it by pointing out any such comments by listing the date and time these inconsistencies occurred. I'm still waiting for that so called proof. Is it too much to ask you simply show proof of all these fakes. Remember your the accuser so it is up to you to prove them as fakes. </p><p>   </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eye czech</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2017, 14:56</p><p>I agree with the person who said we all.  yes we all are tired of fakes like rafa maria carrie katie melissa rafa.  gobs and gobs of gushing diarrhea spewing up eyescene with singly post probably I must say 4000 words per.  its obvious the fakies stand up for the other fakies.  it is odd that soundmans always the one to strike up a chat with these fakies who all know their precises eyeglass prescriptions including sphere and axis.  maybe create a category called soundboard and he can carry away with the fakie lasses.  i believe this board has only 10 bloody real people at this point.  cheers.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2017, 16:58</p><p>Katie </p><p>Glad to hear that you got your new glasses from the optical shop and that you again are back seeing 20/15 again. I think that was what you said they planned on correcting your vision to. And I think it was a good idea to get another pair of glasses as well as a pair of prescription sunglasses because based on how much you're already able to notice the difference from your previous glasses to your new ones you wouldn't be happy if anything were to happy to your new glasses and your previous glasses were all you had to wear. I'm sure the more your eyes adjust to your new glasses it will be even more difficult if you had to get by wearing your previous glasses. And probably both pairs cost less than what contacts would have cost you. Yeah I have never ordered glasses from Coastal so I was a little surprised when you said that you HAD to get your glasses with 1.61 lenses. So I went in to their site and pretended to place an order for glasses with -4.00 lenses and sure enough just as you say it simply doesn't allow you to order the thicker lens which should not cost as much. As you know I am a big fan of Zenni and with Zenni it will RECOMMEND a 1.61 lens but you aren't forced to order it if you don't want it and you simply click on either the 1.50 or 1.57 lens option which both are free lenses. If you want the 1.61 lens it is a $19.00 option. But I do like the glasses you ordered and you should be happy wearing them and that is important. And since you wear your glasses full time getting the thinner lenses will make your glasses look really nice and also they will be lighter in weight as well so your nose may thank you by the end of the day for getting the lighter weight lenses. Nice to here that you're still with the same boyfriend because he really was a big help to you when i'm sure you really weren't all that confident about having to start wearing glasses. He clearly made let you know that your wearing glasses didn't change how he felt about you and how he must still feel for you. Two years sounds pretty serious to me. Could wedding bells be very far off? "Just sayin" Not a bad idea having him help you picking out your glasses since he is the one that sees you the most and of course you want to please him as well with glasses that flatter your looks. You're right that it can be a problem trying to see how you look wearing different glasses if you can't see very well without your glasses. Next time you get your eyes examined go in wearing your glasses but after the exam ask for a trial pair of contacts so you can see yourself better.  </p><p>That was what i seemed to remember with your sister. I'm sure when she got her first glasses she was probably like many others a bit on the shy side about being seen wearing glasses. And of course her first glasses were probably weak enough that she was still able to see pretty well without them. But once her eyesight got a little worse and she saw you wearing your glasses all the time gave her that same confidence that you had. And as long as she has no intention of sticking tiny pieces of plastic on to her eyes she doesn't have much choice if she wants to see. She seems to have even made wearing glasses fun by making her glasses just another fashion accessory. but to that of course you need more than just one pair. So good for her. Just curious if you were unhappy with your Zenni glasses? Seems to me from what I saw Coastal is a bit more expensive, but if you like their glasses more then that's understandable.      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katie</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2017, 18:14</p><p>I just picked up my new glasses after class today and its great to be able to see perfectly again. I did compare my glasses on the way home and it was a huge difference particularly for my left eye which makes sense as the doctor said it was catching up to my right. It's nice to know that my eyes are changing much slower now and I'm hoping that they don't get too much worse from now on. You're right that since I'm not spending anything on contacts I can order another pair of prescription sunglasses since I'll need them without my contacts anymore. Also I did order those glasses from coastal and they required that I order 1.61 index lenses, I guess because my prescription is higher now so that kinda sucks. The 1.67 are much more expensive so I hope my vision never gets bad enough to need those. My boyfriend thinks I look good with the semi rimless glasses but since I've had problems with the wires in the past I didn't want to get them as my main pair but I should get them sometime next week and it will be nice to have options. I am still with my boyfriend, we've been together for over 2 years now. I love having him help me pick out my glasses since I'm a bit indecisive when it comes to getting new glasses, that and it can be hard for me to see what I look like in new glasses without my glasses on. </p><p> </p><p>You're right about my sister, I think that right about the time when she got her second pair of glasses she started needing to wear them all the time. However, she can't stand touching her eyes or even eye drops so I'm not surprised that she never went for contacts. Besides I think she enjoys using glasses as an accessory now and has ordered a bunch of pairs from coastal, she actually recommend them to me over winter break. </p><p> </p><p>Alexandra </p><p> </p><p>I don't know my sister's exact prescription now, I only knew before because I ordered her a pair of glasses and since she is in college now she has been buying her own. She mentioned over winter break that her glasses were stronger than before and I think she said something like -3.50 but I don't know much more than that. As for the Christmas photo, I didn't even think about taking my glasses off for it and didn't notice that we all had glasses until we were sending them out to relatives, I just thought it was kinda interesting. When I first got my glasses I was always taking them off for pictures partly because I didn't want everyone to see me in glasses and partly because I just thought I looked weird wearing glasses in a photo. Even when I was used to seeing myself in a mirror with glasses somehow seeing myself in a photo with glasses just seemed strange so I'd take them off. Once I started wearing them all the time I left them on for pictures and now I think I look really different without my glasses although it is always a bit odd when I get new glasses and have to get used to a new look.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2017, 10:44</p><p>First timer </p><p>Well that's because their glasses are a stronger prescription than what your eyes need. The prescription you got is really about the weakest that a doctor will prescribe anyone. If you were only -.25 in both eyes the doctor would have only suggested that you come back in a year for an exam. So for most -.50 in both eyes is usually the weakest glasses they will prescribe unless you demand it. I'm sure you were probably only told that you should wear your glasses when driving and anytime you feel like you need them when looking at something in the distance. Now of course if you like wearing your glasses and want to wear them more often that is perfectly okay to do and it won't do any harm to your eyes. Anyway so now you understand that by looking through both pairs of your glasses most likely is about the same or close to what some of your friends glasses were that you were trying on. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>first timer</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2017, 10:28</p><p>Thanks.  When in the past I looked through other's glasses things were typically smaller and further away. That is why I was at first surprised that when I got mine that they made things a tad bigger and moved things a bit closer.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2017, 09:59</p><p>First timer </p><p>Yes, that's very normal. Of course as you know what you're really doing is doubling the power of your glasses. So with both together it's the same as wearing -1.00 / -1.50 glasses. And the effect should be that things look smaller but they should also appear very sharp, clear and intense as well. It is common that nearly everyone's eyes enjoys having their eyes slightly over corrected. What you did might be just a bit more than your eyes wanted but if you were to go on line today and order a pair of glasses in -.75 / -1.00 you would probably love those glasses more than the ones you just got because instead of only being corrected to 20/20 you would be seeing 20/15.  </p><p>Enjoy your new glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>First timer</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2017, 08:17</p><p>Just got first glasses, -0.50 and -0.75. Been playing around with them.  When I put them on things appear a bit bigger and closer and I like that. When I put my second pair on over these, everything got smaller and more distant. Is that normal?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2017, 17:27</p><p>Thank you Soundmanpt. I'll probably get accused of being you now that I have commented after you. </p><p>Everyone is entitled to their opinion but there is no need to be so rude. Personally it doesn't offend me but it may offend others. As has been said before if you don't like what I write then don't read it. Swearing so much in just a few lines of text makes you look very immature or lacking in intelligence. Maybe it is because you are not very intelligent that you don't like reading so much. Too many long words? Maybe I should use words that don't have more than two syllables so you can understand the words more easily. English is clearly your first language as someone whose first language isn't English wouldn't use the F word so much. </p><p>Apologies to everyone else for being off topic.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2017, 11:44</p><p>When someone comes in here and their a fake they seem to make comments for maybe a couple weeks or even a month or two and then they just disappear into thin air. They have their fun and move on. If you go back in "Eyescene" you will find that Carrie has been here for well over 6 or 7 years now. And she has always been very clear and accurate about some of her college friends and about their glasses and when they got them and many other facts as well. I really don't think anyone would bother taking that much time to go back and research things they said from so far back. Also she has been on numerous threads so that would make even that much more difficult to go back and find details just to keep up the surrade.  </p><p>So your entitled to your opinion but if theirs one person I completely believe to be real it's Carrie. And just like I have said before I am not ever going to accuse anyone of being a fake unless someone shows me "solid" proof. But of course like Carrie I get called a fake quite often as well and I have only been coming in her for over 10 years now. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2017, 17:27</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Glad to hear that you and everyone had such a great dinner and evening together. Nice to hear that you still have feelings for your ex even though you are both very happy with your new mates these days. You know I would be surprised if he doesn't feel the same way about you as well. Were you surprised to see his girlfriend wearing new / different glasses since you last saw her? So I know how much attention you pay to attractive women wearing glasses so which glasses does she look better wearing? The ones she had on Friday night or the ones you saw her wearing before? She must thing that the ones she wore Friday are abetter choice for an evening out than the other pair. So you must have asked her about her glasses. Did she notice or complement you on your glasses? You said the main talk all evening was about glasses which i'm sure 2 people at that table were enjoying. Of course you and also the lovely Vicky. I'm not at all surprised that Vicky "nags" Danielle making sure she is wearing her glasses as instructed. Vicky i'm sure wants Danielle to wear her glasses full time just like you do. Vicky is glasses crazy herself so of course she wants her partner to be wearing glasses as well. And Danielle just doesn't get it does she? When the girl slides her glasses down her nose and looks around just an average size room and she admitted that "everything looked sharper and the colors more defined" then slides her glasses back up and says that "it's just not enough to need glasses for all the time" The point is if she did that and said that there was no difference at all or that it was better without glasses then yes she doesn't need her glasses full time. At one time she was able to say exactly that, but her eyesight isn't that good anymore and she simply can't see as well without them now. What does she think her glasses are for? At the opticians they did almost everything except tell her to wear her glasses full time. She didn't have much of a change in her new glasses that you and I both know she shouldn't need as much as 2 weeks for her eye to adjust to a small change. They are hoping that after she wears her glasses for 2 weeks that she will decide that she can see better, which she can, if she continues to wear her glasses full time after the 2 weeks. but she is so determined that I have a feeling once the 2 weeks are over she will go back to wearing them as little as possible.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2017, 16:38</p><p>Katie </p><p>You may recall that I told you shortly after you got your first glasses that you would likely be needing some increases in your glasses but your eyesight would never become all that bad. But i'm sure you were concerned at the rate your eyes seemed to have gone almost overnight from you're not wearing glasses at all to needing your glasses full time in such a short time. I think you now understand that what happened was that you actually needed glasses much sooner than you actually got them and the result was that your first prescription was a bit stronger than most first prescriptions. So in effect your glasses were just trying to catchup to your eyes. So now they pretty much have caught up. What you decide about getting a second pair of glasses of course is totally up to you. What you might want to do is wait until you get your new glasses, wear them for a week or so and then try wearing your current glasses for a day just to test how well your able to see with your weaker glasses. But I have a feeling you won't like the results of that test. Since you started wearing glasses it seems that your eyes are more sensitive now if they aren't seeing as clearly as they should be. That was the case when you noticed the Christmas lights not looking right and as you know your eyes had changed but so slightly they even suggest that you get new glasses. Look at it this way, you said that you don't bother with contacts anymore and you wear glasses full time so what you're saving on the contacts should more than pay for a second pair of glasses but also a new pair of prescription sunglasses as well. Besides isn't it kind of nice to change from one pair to another pair just to change your looks a bit? The glasses you posted look very nice and you may even recall me telling you when you ordered a pair of semi-rimless form Zenni a couple years ago that I really like that style on young women. So either from Coastal or Zenni that is up to you which you prefer. As far as lens thickness goes I don't much about Coastal's lenses, but I have ordered semi-rimless from Zenni in the past and I have even only go the 1.57 lenses and they looked fine. But going to the 1.61 for sure should be fine for your prescription.  </p><p>I remembered when your sister got an increase to -2.25 she seemed to be getting more dependent on her glasses too and was beginning to wear them a lot more. But I know she was very reluctant when she got her first glasses about being seen wearing glasses and you even thought that was why she didn't go for her driver's license right away. So there was always the possibility that she would opt for contacts. But she apparently has found out what you already had found out, that wearing glasses really isn't all that bad. But to be fair I know you weren't too thrilled about wearing glasses either at first but you're bf was a lot of support and encouragement to you and that had to be a huge help knowing his feelings for you didn't change just because you were wearing glasses. Are you still with the same bf? </p><p>I remember you mentioning about the difference from your family Christmas photo from 2014 where you or your sister either one were wearing glasses and the 2015 photo you and your sister were both wearing glasses.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2017, 11:33</p><p>What a lovely evening I had! The food was delicious thanks to Gemma (I did help a little bit but she always prefers to do most of it herself). My ex boyfriend and his girlfriend arrived first. He looked very handsome and I have to admit that I got a little tingle inside that told me that I did still fancy him a bit! His girlfriend looked as beautiful as ever. She was wearing different glasses from the last time I saw her. They weren't new but were the other pair she got when she got the ones I saw her wearing. Danielle and Vicky arrived a short time later and I was pleased to see Danielle was wearing her glasses. She kept her glasses on all evening. To my delight the conversation was about glasses and eyesight for a while when my ex complimented my glasses (one of the pairs of round ones I got online) and then asked Danielle how long she had been wearing glasses. Danielle explained that after having glasses for reading and close up work for a few years she now also needs them for distances. My ex said "So I take it you wear them all the time?" She replied "Not exactly. I have to wear them for a couple of weeks to get used to the stronger prescription then it's up to me when I wear them." She looked at Vicky and said "This gorgeous woman nags me if she catches me without them on!" My ex asked how the 'getting used to them' was going. Danielle said that she did seem used to them now but will give it another week to make sure. She looked over her glasses for a moment before looking through them again. She admitted that everything did seem sharper and colours more defined with her glasses on but not enough to need glasses all the time. My ex's girlfriend asked why Danielle didn't want to wear glasses all the time. Danielle said that the more she wore her glasses the worse her eyes seemed to get. My ex's girlfriend said "I know what you mean and I used think the same but my optician told me that my sight would still have got worse without glasses." My ex added "You have chosen a good frame that really suits you!" Everyone agreed and Danielle thanked us. </p><p>There was a bit more about glasses and eyesight we talked about that I might put here another time. </p><p>We didn't get too girly with our chatting, luckily for my ex! </p><p>Knowing that Danielle is borderline needing her glasses full time and seeing her wearing them is fantastic. Gemma looked incredibly sexy and sophisticated in her lovely dress. All the ladies (including me!) looked very glamourous. It was so good to see four very fanciable glasses wearing women in one room. By the time the evening was over and Gemma and I went to bed I was feeling very frisky. Without going into any details we didn't go to sleep until much later! We didn't get up until about midday after....Well you can imagine! We forgot that our guests had also stayed the night but I don't think they heard us. They all had only just got up when we emerged. Danielle was wearing her glasses and was still wearing them when her and Vicky left after we had some brunch.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katie</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2017, 11:10</p><p>Yeah the doctor said that I shouldn't really expect any large changes in my vision from now on especially once I finish school. You are right that I had an updated prescription but I didn't fill it at the time since it wasn't a large change from what I was wearing at the time. Since then my eyes got a bit worse and it became more noticeable (not just the blue lights at night) but overall not as big of a change as the last time I got new glasses. I haven't decided whether I want to order another pair on line yet although I probably should since I can't really see much without my glasses and if I lost or broke my new pair I'd have to use an old prescription. I did look a bit online last night and my boyfriend really liked these: www.coastal.com/glasses/kensie/kensie-faded?v=berry#/?_k=t4fqmd since I got a pair of larger plastic frames from my eye doctor this time. He said I looked good in my old zenni glasses that were a similar style so I may order those. It did say that I need either 1.61 or 1.67 index lenses with my prescription though I'm not entirely sure which one would be better. </p><p> </p><p>Also my sister has been wearing her glasses full time for quite awhile now and has never even tried contacts. She just started college last fall and when she came home for winter break she had new glasses. She is doing pre-med so lots of studying and reading and she couldn't read the board towards the end of the semester so she had to get new glasses. I think she said that she was something like -3.25 or -3.50 in both eyes now so we are just about as blind as each other now. Before she would go around the house without them sometimes, especially in the mornings, but over winter break she had them on as soon as she got up and with her new prescription I can definitely understand why. My sister, my cousins and I also took an extended family Christmas photo and everyone had glasses this year so I guess bad vision really runs in the family. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2017, 21:02</p><p>Katie </p><p>Your right it has been a very long time since you were in here. But I honestly didn't think it was 2 years. It didn't seem quite that long, but sure enough I went back looking and it was even more than 2 years. You got your eyes checked on Aug 26 2015 and you got your current glasses on Sept 8th 2015. Then while looking that up I first came across when you're glasses broke and while there you had your eyes checked because you were having some issues with the blue Christmas lights. You were actually given a slightly stronger prescription at that time of R -4.00 / L -2.50 .-75  170 but since the difference wasn't that much you didn't upgrade your glasses. So what all that really means is that actually your eyes really haven't changed much at all from that eye exam back on Dec 5th 2015. So since that date your eyes only changed by -.50 in both eyes or even better put less than -.25 each year. Are you going to order a backup pair from Zenni again?  And even that change most likely was caused by all the close reading you are doing in college. </p><p>How is your sister doing with her glasses? I know she wasn't all that excited about having to wear glasses in the first place but she reluctantly finally was pretty much wearing them full time once her prescription reached -2.25 in both eyes. Anyway always good to hear from you. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katie</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2017, 17:04</p><p>It has been forever since I last posted here but I've been really busy with school and then moving over the summer so I haven't had much time lately. I did get my yearly eye exam today however and I thought I'd post an update real quick. I had been noticing that it was a little difficult to read the board from the back of the lecture hall and that street signs were a bit blurry at night so I figured that I'd probably need to get my glasses updated. My new prescription is R -4.25 L -3.25 -0.50 x 163 which the doctor said was definitely a large enough change to warrant new glasses since my current glasses were still  R -3.75 L -2.25 -0.75 x 170 from two years ago. I decided to skip getting contacts this time since I found myself hardly ever wearing them and just spend a bit extra on a nicer pair of glasses. The doctor said that my right eye hadn't changed much but now my left eye was catching up a bit and balancing out with my right but that once I finish college my vision will probably start to settle and change a lot slower and that my eyes are healthy and just need a little extra to get back to 20/15. I should be getting my new glasses early next week and it will be great to see in perfect HD again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2017, 15:08</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I'm surprised that Danielle went this long without replacing her broken glasses. I just looked back because it seemed longer than just slightly over 2 weeks since she broke her glasses. It was lucky for her that she was able to tape them well enough that she was able to wear them. I assume she must have tried her previous glasses and found them to be on the weak side. Considering her current glasses were already slightly weaker than the prescription she was given at her most recent eye exam when she chose not to get new glasses. Were you somewhat turned on watching the assistant do the fitting of each pair of glasses as she was putting on and taking the glasses glasses off of Danielle? And it had to be music to your ears when she asked Danielle which pair she wanted to leave on? I forgot that since Daniele was getting new glasses she was getting her most recent prescription put into them. So i'm sure even with a slight increase Danielle's eye's still needed a little bit of time to adjust to the difference. And just as you know with your own glasses your near vision is perfect right away but distance can be a bit blurry at first. The assistant did probably assume since Danielle came in wearing glasses that she likely wears her glasses full time but she also saw on the paperwork what Danielle's prescription is and that also was a why she though Danielle wears her glasses full time already. An assistant knows pretty well just by seeing what someone's prescription is about how much they wear their glasses. Carrie your smart young lady and i'm sure you took note that not only is Danielle supposed to wear her glasses most of the time for the next week or two so her eyes can get used to the prescription. But we both know that with just a small increases Danielle isn't going to need that long for her eyes to adjust. You've had bigger increases than she apparently got and I have a feeling it didn't take anywhere close to that long for your eyes to adjust? I think she was just trying to encourage Danielle into wearing her glasses full time after that week or two. That was also why she was told that besides wearing her glasses fro driving she now needs to start wearing the for other distance things such as going to the cinema. But if she is now supposed to wear them for the cinema then she also need to start wearing them to concerts or sporting events or even watching a TV at a pub. So really she should be wearing the all the time now. You mentioned that one pair of her glasses are Bay-Ban Clubmaster and that is a favorite of mine for young women. Those glasses look hot on every woman I have ever seen and I have little doubt that Danielle is no exception. So now I am really rooting for her to go full time wearing her glasses too. I know you can't say too much to her except to encourage her by letting her know that wearing glasses full time isn't a big deal and will always know where her glasses are and that by wearing them it is far less likely for them to get broken. Maybe being in a room with 4 other very attractive glasses wearing ladies will help her to see that she isn't the only young lady that wears their glasses full time. I'm really jealous of your ex He is one lucky guy to be sitting not only with his own hot glasses wearing girlfriend but you other ladies as well. So I guess as far as Danielle I guess we will first have to see if she does what the optician suggested she do and wear her glasses all the time for the next week or two and then what she does after those weeks are past. By the way do you remember when Danielle and Vicky got their eye examined? It really seems like it has been close to a full year. I am asking because I think Danielle and Vicky are both due eye exams very soon.   </p><p>.   </p><p></p><hr>

We'll look forward to hearing how it goes. The fact that she has invested in a pair of Raybans must surely be a good sign! </p><p> </p><p>In a way it is a pity that the lady in the shop didn't say something like "Well most people with your prescription would probably wear their glasses all the time so I assumed you would" but she did give her a definite nudge in the right direction. Hopefully if she follows the advice she'll realise after a couple of weeks that she'd be better off leaving them on. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2017, 13:10</p><p>We went with our friend Danielle to pick up her new glasses last Saturday. As I mentioned in Sightings a couple of weeks ago, the glasses she was replacing were still taped at the hinge and couldn't be folded to go in their case so she was wearing them. Luckily the tape was barely noticeable so her glasses didn't look too bad. We got to the opticians and Danielle was served almost straight away. She had ordered 2 pairs of glasses. The lady serving put the first pair on Danielle and checked the fit was good and comfortable after adjusting them a couple of times and checked how well Danielle could see with them. She did the same with the second pair. Danielle said she could see perfectly close up with the new glasses but the distance was just very slightly out of focus at first but got better if she concentrated. She took the second pair off and commented that she could see across the room slightly better with the glasses on but it wasn't a huge difference. The lady gave both pairs of new glasses an extra polish on the lenses and asked Danielle which pair she would like to wear now. Danielle was a little bit surprised and said "I wasn't going to wear either of them. Do you think I should?" The lady replied that she assumed Danielle wore glasses full time because she came in wearing her old ones. Danielle explained why she had her glasses on when she came in said that she normally only wears her glasses for reading and working and more recently for driving because driving makes her eyes feel tired and she found that her glasses stop them feeling tired. The lady suggested to Danielle that it might be a good idea to wear her glasses most of the time for a week or two so she could get used to the new prescription and then she if she isn't going to continue to wear them most of the time she should wear her new glasses as she did with her old ones but also to wear them for looking at distances such as watching a film at the cinema. In fact she should wear her glasses in any situation that she feels her eyes straining or feeling tired. Danielle put the first pair back on, which were Ray Ban Clubmaster frames, and put her old glasses in the empty case (the tape came off the frame when Danielle folded the arms closed). The other pair of new glasses were large plastic frames. Danielle put them in their case and put both cases in her bag. She thanked the lady and we said goodbye and left.  </p><p>Danielle kept her new glasses on. I told her I was rather jealous that she looked so good in the Clubmaster frames because that style just doesn't suit me. She got me to put her glasses on and she looked at me with a big smile and said "You're absolutely right, they don't suit you! They don't look ridiculous just not right for your face. But you look fantastic in yours!" </p><p>A bit later in the day I casually asked her how well she could see in the distance now she had been wearing her glasses for a few hours. She said it was certainly no worse than without glasses, about the same. She concentrated on a shop sign up the street for a few seconds before pulling her glasses down her nose to look over them. She admitted that, like in the opticians, if she concentrated it was actually clearer but she could still read it without glasses.  </p><p>Just before Gemma and I went home I asked Danielle if she was going to do what the lady in the opticians suggested. Danielle replied laughing "Yes mum!" but added more seriously that she would. </p><p>That was a great day seeing Danielle wearing one of her new pairs of glasses all day and knowing she is probably going to wear them full time for several days.  </p><p>Danielle and her girlfriend Vicky are coming to dinner on Friday night. My lovely ex boyfriend and his gorgeous girlfriend are also coming. So it will be 1 man with no glasses and 5 women with glasses! Lucky boy! (It might actually poor boy stuck in a room with 5 women yacking away!) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2017, 00:26</p><p>SC, </p><p>When I was getting ready for the surgery, they used an ultra sound probe that very lightly touched the Cornea to measure the structure of my eyes after administering anesthetic drops so I would not feel the touch.  The reason for the very light touch to avoid deforming the Cornea by any pressure.  The dimensions of the structures of the eye are small and the lenses involved are very strong.  For example, a 1 diopter refractive error is typically the result of a 0.3 mm error in the distance from the crystalline lens to the Retina. </p><p>With those dimensions they can calculate the IOL power needed to achieve the desired prescription.  However, IOLs only come in 0.50 diopter increments and the measurements are not super precise.  They can get pretty close, but they don't always wind up with the exact target prescription.  Sometimes the prescription is fine tuned using Lasik. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glasses questions</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2017, 16:30</p><p>Thanks for the information. I live near Cleveland, Ohio. When I have cataract surgery at some point I would not go for the multi focal IOL's. I tried multifocal contacts once and did not like them. I get better vision from wearing my progressives. I wear them pretty much full time. I'm minus .75 for distance and have slight astigmatism. My add is now plus 3.0 and I find I can't see much of anything close up. One question I have is if I went for single vision IOL's and had them set for perfect up close vision -I understand I would need glasses for distance and I'm fine with that. I would rather have the perfect close up vision. If I did that - how myopic would I be?? I tried mono vision once and decided that it's not for me. I work as an esthetician doing lots of close up tasks with facials, waxing eyebrows and makeup. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>helpful</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2017, 02:05</p><p> </p><p>Cactus jack </p><p> </p><p>If the contributor is living in the UK then he can wait a long time for an operation for cataract surgery although the operation is easily done. This is due to pressure on the National Health Service so they delay many people treatment unless you pay to go private. This applies to other forms of simple surgery like hernia</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2017, 22:18</p><p>Glasses questions, </p><p>By the way.  With Mono vision I can function pretty well with out my glasses.  One eye is close to 20/20 distance vision without glasses and the other eye is mildly nearsighted at about -1.50.  When I want to see really well,  I wear trifocals because I the type work I do.  My vision with glasses, after the Cataract Surgery, is better than 20/20.  On a good day I can read most of the letters on the 20/15 line and one or two on the 20/10 line.  Not bad for a 79 year old. </p><p>Good luck. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2017, 22:12</p><p>Glasses questions, </p><p>+3.00 is not a particularly strong add, if you are developing Cataracts.  Presbyopia is really the gradual stiffening of the protein that makes up your Crystalline Lenses, that are part of your Auto-Focus system.  Cataracts just make that stiffness happen quicker.  At some point, your add is really determined by your preferred reading distance.  +3.00 focuses at a distance of about 33 cm or 13 inches.  You many have noticed that OTC Readers are usually available up to about +3.50, which focus at about 28 cm or 11 inches.  Stronger prescription glasses or "clip ons" are available. </p><p>If you are developing Cataracts, is there any real reason for waiting to get Cataract Surgery?  In the old days, before IOLs, they used to wait until the Cataracts got "Ripe" or get very hard before removing the lens and lens capsule.  That operation was a very serious one that required months for recovery.  I really think they were hoping the patient would die before they actually had to do the surgery.  When the lens and lens capsule are removed, you have to wear very strong PLUS glasses. </p><p>Today, Cataract surgery with IOL replacement lenses is almost a non-event.  The surgery takes about 10 minutes IF the Crystalline Lens is still soft enough to be easily emulsified and sucked out.  It takes longer if the lens is harder.  The Capsule is left in place and the new lens is actually inserted in the old capsule through a very tiny incision (3 mm) in the side of the cornea.  The surgery is so safe and easy that some people are opting to have their stiffening Crystalline Lenses removed and multi-focal IOL lenses installed, long before they actually need Cataract surgery.  The operation is exactly the same and Cataract surgery will never be necessary.  Be aware that multi-focal IOLs are not for everyone. </p><p>I had Cataract Surgery with single vision IOLs for Mono Vision in July of 2001 and have never regretted it for an instant.  I can fully understand any reluctance about the surgery.  I was very nervous about the surgery, but didn't have much choice.  As I said the surgery was a non-event.  I was moderately nearsighted before the surgery, but that was pretty much fixed by the choice of the IOL power for that eye.  I took the lens out of my glasses for that eye and drove myself to the doctor's office the next day.  He was pleased with the results and my big question was "When can you do the other eye"?  He said two weeks.  My response of That Long??  If he had said tomorrow, I would have been happier.  I really didn't want to wait, but he wanted to make absolutely sure everything was OK before doing the other eye. </p><p>Based on my experience, if I needed Cataract Surgery in 18 months, I would want to do it next week so I could enjoy 18 more months of good vision. </p><p>May I ask where you live? </p><p>Please feel free to ask more questions if you need to. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glasses questions</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2017, 20:34</p><p>Hi - I have some questions that I'm hoping I can get some help here. I'm 49 years old and first got glasses at 45 - progressives with a plus 1.0 add . Last year my ECP said I now needed an add of plus 3.0. I was having a difficult time reading smaller print.  I was also diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes. Will my add continue to go up?? He wanted to see me in 18 months. I feel like I am again beginning to struggle with small print. But is a 3.0 add already quite strong for my age?? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2017, 02:20</p><p>George1968, </p><p>I believe you have it backwards.  It is the eye (Ciliary) muscles of a person who is very myopic, that are already relaxed.  They are often so weak that they have trouble focusing close, when they get Minus glasses to correct their distance vision. </p><p>It is people who have Hyperopia or Latent Hyperopia, who need for their Ciliary Muscles to relax when they get Plus glasses. </p><p>CotGlasses needs t strengthen his/her Ciliary Muscles.  We do not know if he/she has the full prescription. The +1.00 add is about right for the distance from his/her eyes to the computer, but it is a little awkward to tilt the head back to look thru the segment for the computer, but the +1.00 is not nearly strong enough to enable focusing at a normal reading distance. </p><p>In this situation, the ECP should probably have prescribed "functional" trifocals that are a little weaker than would be prescribed for an older person with advanced Presbyopia.  Something like a reading Add of +2.00 and an intermediate segment of +1.00.  As the Ciliary Muscles get stronger over a few weeks, the Add powers could be reduced and eventually eliminated. </p><p>A really good and inexpensive solution is to get some Clip-on Magnifiers from RxSafety Glasses.  They are available in a nice assortment of powers and, if you do have the ability to focus, you can work your way down in power as your Ciliary Muscles get stronger. </p><p>I have no ability to focus after Cataract Surgery and normally wear trifocals.  I have both Clip-ons and single vision Reading Glasses.  GotGlasses should not need focusing help for very long, but Clip-on + lenses might slow Myopic Progression that is sometimes  exacerbated by extended periods of focusing on a computer display or reading. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

I have no idea how you were able to function, particularly in school.  Your eye muscles have been straining hard for years to see, and now they have to relax.   </p><p> </p><p>It won't take long - a week or two.  Your eye muscles have to relax and your brain has to be re-trained a bit to interpret the new visual stimuli.   </p><p> </p><p>There is good news and bad news.  Eventually, you will be able to see and to get rid of the bifocals (at least until you are in your 40s.  The bad news is that you will likely need stronger glasses in six months.  Once your eye muscles relax, your sight will go to its true prescription.  So, you will likely go to about -6.00.   </p><p> </p><p>How old are you?  Are you male or female?

<p><b>GotGlasses</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2017, 15:28</p><p>I am using the bottome part, under the line to read, but it is still difficult. The bottom part is great for seeing the computer screen, better than the top, but none are working for reading.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2017, 14:50</p><p>GotGlasses </p><p>I think what you may not be doing is using the add segment of your glasses and instead you're trying to read using the distance part of your glasses. What you should be doing is not moving your head down when you are reading something, but only moving your eyes downward like your trying to see the very bottom of your lenses. So that means your head should be looking straight out ahead of you, but your eyes looking down through the lowest part of your glasses. That is the area you need for reading small print. Does this make sense to you? It takes a little bit of practice but in a very short time learning what part of your glasses to use for distance and for reading will become very natural and you won't even have to think about it. But for now you will have ot thinks when you start to read from a book. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2017, 18:00</p><p>GotGlasses, </p><p>I think I may have mentioned that you might have that problem.  Because of your prescription, your Auto-Focus has not had to do anything to help you focus close.  It will take a few days for your Auto-Focus system to re-learn how to do its job. </p><p>One thing you can do is get some over the counter reading glasses and wear them over your new glasse.  I would suggest the lowest available power, but you may need to try on something in the +1.50.  Hopefully you will only need them for a week or so. </p><p>There is a company in New Jersey, RxSafety Glasses that sells Clip-On Magnifiers (Reading Glasses) in powers as low as +1.00.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2017, 11:38</p><p>GotGlasses, </p><p>Congratulations, welcome to being able to see this amazing, incredible world where we live.  You have not mentioned if you live in a city or not, but I think you will be even more surprised at what you can see at night.  It is now winter in America, but just wait until spring.  You are in for a wonderful treat. The night sky is often super clear on a winter night.  It is filled with millions of stars, a few planets, and of course the moon. Things you can see without a telescope or binoculars. Most are so far away that the distances are measured in AU, Astronomical Units (the average distance from the Earth to the Sun) or in Light Years.  The light from the nearest star takes 4 years to get here. </p><p>The brief double vision and the unstable images (lets don't call it Nystagmus, yet) could be related or completely different causes, including blurred vision.  Your Vision system, Eye Position Control System, Focus Control System, and Vestibular (balance) System are amazing, complex, and interconnected systems in your brain or are very close to your brain.  Sometimes it is very difficult to isolate the systems because of the interactions.  Problems in the separate systems can sometimes have similar symptoms. </p><p>The first thing to is correct your Vision, which you are doing with your new glasses.  Many times, correcting vision problems will let other things, such as you have described, simply go away.  As a doctor friend of mine said, "The body can correct about 85%f the things that go wrong.  Sometimes the best thing is to just let the body heal itself.  The trick is to know which is the 85% and the 15% that will only get better with help." </p><p>Being Myopic (nearsighted) with Astigmatism is one of the things where the body needs help to see.  I suggest you give it a few weeks before worrying about any other problems.  You mentioned that things look smaller and farther away with your glasses.  That is an optical phenomenon caused by Minus lenses.  Plus lenses make things look bigger.   </p><p>I mentioned previously, that you have built in excess Plus around +5 to +6.  That excess Plus makes you see things blurry and larger than they actually are.  The Minus lenses in your glasses neutralize or cancel out the excess Plus and make the images on your Retinas slightly smaller than normal, but in focus and very clear.  As Soundmanpt said, in a few days or a week, that sensation will go away. </p><p>You mentioned that you were in the 9th grade.  May I ask your favorite subjects?  Have you had any science or math courses? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2017, 11:09</p><p>to: Got Glasses </p><p> </p><p>I'm so happy for you. You're saying, this was one of the best days in your life. </p><p> </p><p>I sometimes have checked with +6.00 contact lenses, and -6.00 glasses over them, how a person could see (I wanted to find out, how my daughter could see), and I cant imagine, that you have been such a long time without adequatre glasses. </p><p> </p><p>So my gratulation - hope you always find nice glasses for good vision and got looking (that's important in your age as well!).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2017, 09:57</p><p>GotGlasses </p><p>I'm sure that you were quite shocked when you put your glasses on for the first time. You now are seeing all the things you have missing. That effect that you are noticing that everything is looking smaller and a bit further away is very normal. Your eyes are still adjusting to your glasses and that may take a day or two before everything looks normal with your glasses on. by the end of the day and you take your glasses off you're going to be amazed at how blurry everything is, even more than it was yesterday. I assume by what you're saying you now understand why you have been getting told that you will be wearing your glasses full time?  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2017, 09:09</p><p>GettingGlasses, </p><p>You may be experiencing a condition called Nystagmus or what is sometimes called Dancing Eyes.  There are several types and causes.  Sometimes the cause is not directly related to the eyes, but is caused by the balance system.  Sometimes the Semi-Circular canals in your ears that sense head position and motion send incorrect signals to the Eye Positioning System and that causes the eyes to move. Usually, they move back and forth, but can also move up and down. </p><p>I suggest waiting until after you get your glasses, to follow up on that.  It could also be caused by your Eye Position Control System (EPCS) trying to adjust your eye position.  There are several "minor" inputs to the EPCS, but the "major" input is images from your eyes.  The EPCS needs sharp images to be able to do it job well.  It seems to work by matching vertical edges in the image for horizontal motion and horizontal edges for vertical motion to keep the eyes tracking properly.  If the images are not clear and sharp, it is very hard to get the eyes aimed properly.  Without clear images, it is an impossible task, but the system tries anyway. </p><p>When do you think your glasses will be ready? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2017, 02:16</p><p>GettingGlasses </p><p>  That is a very strong first prescription. You will be wearing glasses full time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GettingGlasses</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2017, 00:38</p><p>Not sure where this fits in or if it is even inportnat, but even though I have never noticed double vision I do sometimes notice what I call bouncing vision. What happens is, like if I am looking at a cup on a table I think I see it with both eyes and it looks like it is where it is, and then it bounces as if I am only seeing it with one eye and then I can bounce it to see it with the other and back to seeing it centere with both eyes. Not sure if I explained that correct, but I hope you understand what I mean.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2017, 23:57</p><p>GettingGlasses, </p><p>Probably nothing right now.  You don't seem to have any trouble with double vision with right now.  When you get your glasses, there is another test I can suggest in that regard.  You may have some slight eye misalignment, most people have a little, but it apparently is easy for you to over come. If you have been reading as close as you probably have, I suspect you might have a bit of excess convergence, but I suggest not worrying about that right now.  With your glasses you will be able to read further away and that will reduce the amount of convergence you need and the excess convergence may go away in a few weeks. </p><p>It is very likely that you have not been using your Ciliary Muscles for quite some time and you may have some trouble focusing close with your glasses, that is the reason for the +1.00 add.  It may take some effort and possible discomfort teaching your auto-focus system to work at full efficiency because I suspect your Ciliary Muscles are very weak. </p><p>Near the end of your eye exam, I suspect you were shown a small card with letters on it about 14 inches from your eyes and you had trouble reading it.  The examiner added some Plus to help you read it.  That is the +1.00 add.  Initially it may not be enough until your Ciliary Muscles get strong enough to do their job. </p><p>The Ciiary muscles are very tiny muscles inside your eyes.  For their size, they are normally the strongest muscles in the body.  They are part of your Auto-Focus system and their job is to squeeze your Crystalline Lenses to supply the PLUS you need to focus close, IF you have good distance vision.   </p><p>Being nearsighted as you are, is like having very strong built in Reading Glasses that you wear all the time.  However if you look at over the counter Reading Glasses in the stores, you will notice that they only go up to about +3.50 that is usually the strongest Reading Glasses that anyone ever needs.  Your built in reading glasses are in the +5.00 to +6.00 range, not counting your Astigmatism. </p><p>If you have problems focusing close with your glasses, please let me know and I will tell you what and when you should notify the examiner. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GettingGlasses</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2017, 23:20</p><p>I am fairly certain this is my prescription. I already chose them,but the shoo was too busy and they could not get them ready yet, should be done tomorrow. I live in America. I have never noticed double vision before. I did the test, and I got about 4 and a half, to 5 inches. What should I do about the two charts thing? Do I go back and tell the doctor?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2017, 21:49</p><p>GettingGlasses, </p><p>I will try to answer your question about the brief double vision in a moment. </p><p>That is a very strong first prescription.  It is very surprising that you have been able to get to the 9th grade without some correction.  I am wondering if they gave you the correct information. </p><p>I am very curious about those numbers.  Here is what those numbers mean: </p><p>There are several parts to an optical prescription.  This is the traditional meaning </p><p>First Row = OD (Right Eye) Sphere -5.50, Cylinder -1.00, Axis 120 degrees, Bifocal Add +1.00, Prism blank means none </p><p>Second Row = Left Eye (OS) Sphere -5.75, Cylinder -1.25, Axis 005 degrees, Bifocal Add +1.00 </p><p>The dominant part of this prescription is the Sphere numbers.  What they mean is that everything beyond 18 cm or 7 inches is increasing blurry.  That would indicate that you are very nearsighted and would be unable to read anything on the board and you would have to hold a book a bit closer than 18 cm or 7 inches to be able to read it.  The Cylinder correction just indicates that a person needing these glasses would have moderate Astigmatism, which messes up vision at ALL distances and makes the nearsightedness worse so the distances I calculated above would be even a bit less. </p><p>Is it possible that is NOT your prescription?  Have you ordered glasses yet? </p><p>There is a simple test you may be able to do to confirm this prescription is yours.  Hold a book close enough to read and gradually move it away until the text just becomes impossible to read.  Measure the distance and let us know what it is. </p><p>May I ask where you live and where you got the Eye Exam? </p><p>As I stated in "How to Study . . .". you should see two images when the examiner first opens both shutters.  Usually, there is significant prism in place to assure that you will see double and the image separation will be enough that you will not be able to fuse the images until some adjustments are made.  The typical starting setting is with significant horizontal  Base In prism and enough Vertical prism to make sure the images are separated vertically.  The Base In prism is gradually reduced to Zero and then increased in the Base Out direction until the two images are aligned horizontally and then the test is repeated with the images separated horizontally and the Base Up or Base Down prism is adjusted until the images are aligned vertically.  It sound like that part of the test was skipped.  You probably have a little bit of eye misalignment and you probably should have mentioned it.  Because you were able to almost instantly fuse the images it is likely that it is not significant, but it should be evaluated. </p><p>Have you ever noticed double vision on any other occasion? </p><p>Please do the test outlined above and answer the questions.  I think we need to chat some more. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2017, 17:24</p><p>The prescription is a chart on the back of a business card. The numbers in the first row are -5.5, -1.00, 120 +1.00 The second row is -5.75, -1.25, 005 and +1.00. I am 15 years old and am in 9th grade. Something you said in your previous post has cought my attention. During the exam when the doctor opened both eyes I saw two of the chart for a split second, but thrn it became one. I told the doctor I saw one. Is that okay?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2017, 16:18</p><p>Jenna, </p><p>No, not bad.  In fact, very good.  Just to give you an ideal of what your prescription means, without your glasses the first number (Sphere)  -1.75 indicates that everything beyond about 57 cm or 22 inches is increasingly out of focus and the and number (Cylinder) just makes it a bit more blurry. </p><p>You should wear your glasses full time, particularly for distance.  Your prescriptions mean that you effectively have built in Reading Glasses very similar to the over the counter Reading Glasses sold in many stores.  It may be tempting to do close work without your glasses because initially it may be more comfortable than wearing your glasses.  That may not be a good idea.  It depends on your age and possibly your occupation, which you didn't mention. </p><p>If you are young enough that the onset of Presbyopia is not a factor, not wearing your glasses for close work allows your Ciliary Muscles to get weak from disuse.  The Ciliary Muscles are very tiny muscles in your eyes that can change the Plus power of your Crystalline Lenses, they are the heart of your auto-focus system.  If your Ciliary Muscles are weak, they will cause the symptoms of Presbyopia and you will initially have some trouble focusing close while wearing your glasses.  That should not last very long, maybe a week or 10 days as your Auto-Focus system gets used to working like it is supposed to. </p><p>Vision actually occurs in the brain.  Your eyes are merely biological cameras.  Your brain has amazing ability to correct what you "see", but it takes extra work and energy.  Your glasses correct the quality of the images delivered to your brain and it no longer has to do the correction process.  However, it will take your brain a few days to realize that your glasses are really a labor saving tool and it can apply the image processing and correction task to other things.  When that happens, most people thing the their glasses have made their vision worse.  That is not true.  In many ways, your brain is a biological computer and it as filed away the old image processing program and loaded a new program with minimal image processing. </p><p>I urge you to wear your glasses full time for about two week and then make the decision when to wear them.  No one can tell you that you MUST wear glasses or that you CAN NOT.  The only exception to that is the situation where your vision can affect the safety of others.  If you drive, it is very likely that your Drivers License would specify that you must wear Corrective Lenses to legally drive. </p><p>Hope this helps and you enjoy your good vision.  I think you will be amazed to learn what you have been missing and wish that you had not waited so long to get glasses. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2017, 12:15</p><p>GettingGlasses. </p><p>You might find this helpful. </p><p>HOW TO STUDY FOR AN EYE EXAM </p><p>An eye exam is not like an exam that you might take in school and there is really no way to study for it.  However, you can prepare for it and learn about your role in the exam.  The best eye exams are a team effort between you and the Examiner.  Part of the preparation is to learn what to expect, particularly if this is your first eye exam. </p><p>One important thing you need to keep in mind is that the Examiner has no way to experience what you are seeing.  He/she has to depend on your answers to questions. </p><p>There are two parts to an eye exam.  The first part is the Objective part. This part consists of: </p><p>1. Taking a Visual History where you describe your vision and the kinds of problems you are having. </p><p>2. Checking the internal pressure in your eyes for symptoms of Glaucoma.       	This is one of the very few parts of an eye exam that is even mildly 		uncomfortable and the discomfort only lasts for a few seconds.  		There are two basic ways to do the pressure test. </p><p>	A. Using a special instrument to lightly touch your Cornea.  Not to                      worry here.  Before doing this type of test a drop of mild anesthetic will make sure you dont even feel it. </p><p>	B. There is a new type instrument that uses a puff of air directed against your cornea.  No anesthetic is required, but the puff will startle you.  The puff of air is harmless and there are huge benefits.  Detecting Glaucoma early, before it can do damage can save your eyesight. </p><p>3. The examiner will also get a preliminary estimate of your refractive error by using an Auto-Refractor or manually by using a small hand held instrument called an Ophthalmoscope or Retinoscope. </p><p>The Auto-Refractor is a relatively new instrument that was developed in conjunction with NASA to check Astronauts vision in space.  You look into the machine with each eye individually where you will see a scene or a pattern.  The machine will adjust its internal lenses to focus the image you see on your retina.  The Auto-Refractor only takes a few seconds for each eye and it then prints out your estimated prescription. </p><p>Some Examiners prefer to use manual methods that have been used for many years.  Using an Ophthalmoscope or Retinoscope and a Trial Lens set or a Phoropter (a fancy machine with a built in lens set), the Examiner will look into your eyes and select the lenses that allow him to see your retina, most clearly. </p><p>The object of this part of the exam is to get a starting place for the Subjective part of the exam where you have to describe what you see. </p><p>Typically the Subjective part of the exam starts with the Right Eye shutter open and the Left Eye shutter closed. </p><p>Step 1 is typically determining the cylinder and axis of any Astigmatism correction you need. This is actually the hardest part of the exam because you will be asked to judge relative blurriness of two images rather than the sharpness of an image. </p><p>You will be shown a line of text and a supplemental lens will be rotated into place.  This lens is a cylinder lens that is mounted on a 45 degree pivot and can be flopped back an forth to bracket a trial axis or orientation of the long axis of the cylinder lens.  The thing that is confusing about this test is that the straight lines (strokes) of the letters will alternate in clarity as the lens is flipped back and forth depending on their direction.  I suggest concentrating on an O if possible.  Depending on your answers, the examiner will adjust the axis knob unit the image you see is equally blurry with the supplemental lens 45 degrees each side of the selected axis. </p><p>At this point the Examiner will probably swing the supplemental lens out of the way and may change the cylinder power while asking you which lens in clearer. </p><p>For your first exam, you may be uncomfortable asking the Examiner to let you fine tune the Cylinder Axis, but I have found that most will appreciate your wanting to actively participate.  The way that works is that he will place your hand on the Axis control knob.  This time, you move it back and forth a few degrees looking for the sharpest image. It is a bit like Fine Tuning an old Analog TV set or moving the tuning knob on an analog AM radio for the best signal. </p><p>The next step is determining the Sphere correction.  This is an easy part of the exam because all you have to do is pick the sharpest image, but there is a tricky part.  Your auto-focus mechanism will try to help, if it gets a chance.  The Examiner has a couple of ways to minimize the action of your ciliary muscles and crystalline lenses. </p><p>The Examiner can, in effect, sneak up on your Sphere prescription or he can use drops to Dilate your eyes. Lets talk about sneaking up on your prescription first.  There are actually 4 lenses in your eyes lens system.  All of them are PLUS lenses and the total power is about +56 to +60 diopters.  The only variable focus lens is the crystalline lens whose PLUS power is controlled by your ciliary muscles.  For distance, your Crystalline lens is fully relaxed and has somewhere around +15 diopters.  When you focus to read, your Ciliary Muscles squeeze the Crystalline lens to increase its PLUS power by the amount necessary to focus which depends on the distance to the object. </p><p>This will take a little thought to get your mind around, but if you are nearsighted, your lens system has too much PLUS for the distance from the lens system to your retina and you need MINUS lenses to neutralize some of that excess PLUS power.  You ONLY have the ability to increase the PLUS power of your lens system.  You have NO ability to reduce the PLUS power of your Crystalline lenses more that fully relaxed. </p><p>To try to keep your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline lenses from getting in the act, the examiner will start with NOT ENOUGH MINUS or TOO MUCH PLUS (same thing) and gradually increase the MINUS one or two steps at a time, while reducing the size of the line you are asked to read. He will not tell you what power lens or what line you are looking at.  Eventually, he will reach the 20/20 line and a lens power that lets you read it with no mistakes. </p><p>He will then follow the same procedure with your Left Eye. </p><p>When he has completed both eyes, he will open the shutters and you may see two images.  This part of the test is to check your muscle balance using some prisms.  He will probably ask you to tell him when the two images are aligned horizontally and then vertically.  While the images are separated, you have an important check to make.  Compare the sharpness of the two images.  If they are not equally sharp, be sure and tell the Examiner which image is clearer.  If there is a difference, he will likely reduce the sharpness of the clearest image until they match.  The important thing at this point is that they match.  That lack of sharpness will be corrected in the next phase with both eyes working together. </p><p>Next he will fuse the images so both eyes are working together and repeat the Sphere procedure by gradually increasing the MINUS or decreasing the PLUS until you see the smallest line of letters very clearly. </p><p>That pretty much completes the exam except for checking your near vision with a small chart about 14 to 16 inches from you. </p><p>Many people, who wear glasses, actually look forward to eye exams.  Once you have become accustomed to having very good vision, you will probably find anything less, unacceptable.  Many times, after the exam, it will be suggested that you get another exam some time in the future.  Note that I used the word suggested. it is NOT a  Command.  If your detect a problem or if your vision seems uncomfortable, please dont wait until the suggested date to seek an appointment to get your vision checked. </p><p>Please let us know about your exam and your glasses prescription. </p><p>C. </p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GettingGlasses</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2017, 11:58</p><p>Just got back from the appointment, and as I already knew I need glasses. The doctor seemed surprised that I did not already have glasses.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2017, 10:27</p><p>GettingGlasses </p><p>Nice to hear that you're finally getting your eyes examined. I assume that you might be rather young and you have been having a problem with convincing your parents that you think you need glasses? It seems that since glasses have become more popular in recent years that parents often think that their son or daughter is only wanting glasses because they are popular or because a friend at school recently got glasses. Anyway you seem quite certain that the result of your eye exam will have you wearing glasses in the near future. But now that you're about go for the exam you are becoming anxious about the exam. It's very true now that an eye exam can often find early signs of glaucoma as well as other health issues that you might have which may not even seem to connect to your eyes. Such things as diabetes and heart problems are a couple of things for example. But if you do have any of these things finding out now is better than finding out later. But most likely they will only find that you need glasses like millions of others. The full eye exam will only take around 40 to 50 minutes. Since these will be your first glasses and if your eyesight really does "suck" it's very possible that you will be wearing your glasses full time. So you're right in wanting to find the "perfect" pair that looks the very best on you. You didn't say if you're male or female but since you seem concerned about the looks of the glasses I am guessing that you might be a female. Guys don't often think about having their glasses look good. I'm sure that as soon as you come out from the exam that an optician will greet you and offer to help you choose your glasses. Trust this person. After a while you will probably have several frames that you really like and then it will be up to you as to which one you like the best.One tip I will suggest is since these will be your first glasses and for most there is a "getting used to your glasses" period. Dark full plastic frames often look nice but for many they are bothered by seeing so much of the frame in their line of vision. After a while of course you get used it and it no longer bothers you. But you may want to consider a semi-rimless frame where there is only frame across the top of your glasses and no frame on the sides or bottom to get in your view. I highly suggest that you be sure to ask for a copy of your prescription as well as your PD measurement before you leave the store. Now that your getting glasses you might want to get another pair or two and maybe even prescription sunglasses. Having your rx and PD will allow you to go on line and order glasses at much more inexpensive price. The one many of us favor in here is "zennioptical.com" they have several hundred for under $13.00 to choose from.  </p><p>When you return form your eye exam please tell us how it went. And calm down you have nothing to be concerned about. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;24 Dec 2016, 11:06</p><p>Kala </p><p>Most people never really notices their eyesight is changing until it gets bad enough for them to notice, sometimes they are made aware of it by trying on a friends glasses and being surprised at how well they can see or being with a group of friends and being the only one unable to read a menu board or some other sign maybe. You may feel like you can see fine but if you weren't able to read the letters on the lower part of the eye chart then your not seeing fine. Letters are what make up words so if you couldn't see the smaller letters then you can't read words either like at school on the blackboard for example very well. What you are able to see is because you may manage to see a few letters of each word and then figure out what the word is even though you can't see some of the letters clearly. Getting your first glasses can be a bit scary because your afraid of what your friends are going to say when they see you wearing glasses. That's actually pretty normal, but I have a feeling that some of your friends already wear glasses and they had to go through it too when they got their glasses. Glasses are very common these days and all that is going to happen is that you're going to get lots of complements on how nice you look wearing glasses. Only someone very immature would ever tease you about wearing glasses and i'm sure it wouldn't be someone you call a friend. Like "Cactus Jack" said wear your glasses all the time for about the first 2 weeks and then decide if you still think you see fine without glasses or not. You're going to be seeing a lot more than just those few lines at the bottom of the eye chart. By the way haven't you heard that glasses have become a fashion accessory for many young ladies these days. You only need to go into a boutique such as Claire's to see the racks of fake glasses they have. After you have had your glasses for a few days come back and give an updated report about wearing glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Dec 2016, 10:03</p><p>Kala, </p><p>Many young people have a similar opinion as you, about your vision.  Everyone thinks that their vision is just fine, because they have no frame of reference.  Vision actually occurs in the brain, your eyes are merely biological cameras.  You brain has the ability to correct what you "see" IF it knows what something is supposed to look like, but it takes a lot of energy and effort.  Your brain can even create images with your eyes closed.  Ever had a dream? </p><p>It is normal to be worried about getting glasses.  Particularly about what other will say or think.  Glasses are simply tools to help you see better.  In some ways they are no different than wearing shoes, which are tools to keep the rocks from hurting your feet. The comments about your glasses, by others,  will only last for 2 or 3 days, just like happens when you get new clothes or a new hair style. </p><p>I urge you to wear your glasses every hour you are awake for 2 weeks before you make a judgement about their benefits.  Initially, you will think they have made your vision worse, but that is not really true.  What will happen is that your brain will discover that your glasses are doing the extra work it was doing and it can use it abilities for other things. </p><p>I suspect that in a few weeks, you will change your mind and decide that seeing really well, is the best Christmas present, ever. </p><p>May I ask your age and if you know it, your prescription? </p><p>If you are curious about what your prescription means, we can help you with that. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

He was all like, "I am surprised Kala has not been having trouble in school. She has quite the need for glasses." I see fine.

Well by wearing glasses that are just a bit quirky that is exactly what you're doing and why not? You already enjoy wearing your glasses and in the past you have pretty much stayed in between the lines with your glasses. Remember you usually describe your glasses when you get new ones. They are always very nice and i'm sure probably look very nice on you but also very "inside the lines" glasses. I would not at all be surprised if these new glasses aren't your favorites very shortly. I can't wait to hear what all you're glasses wearing friends think of them. My guess is that you're sue to get many complements on them. I'm betting they are the most comfortable glasses you own?  </p><p>I'm as ready as I am ever going to be for Christmas. I don't have any family living anymore so I really don't bother with Christmas. I stopped putting up a tree several years ago. But I don't want to be a "Bah-Hum-Bug" person either. For a number of years it bothered me to watch any Christmas movies, but in the last couple years I have started watching and enjoying them. But I am glad when January 2nd comes along.  </p><p></p><hr>

Yes, I am not fat but I do have what is known as a "muffin top" when I wear jeans and my breasts are a rather on the big side which makes me feel self-conscious somtimes in front of some men, especially ones I don't know. I have been wanting to get some round glasses for quite a while now and am really pleased to be able to get some at a good price. They are quite quirky for me as most of my frames have been fairly 'safe'. </p><p>I was given the impression at my last eye test that I now have my full prescription, but maybe I don't. </p><p>We are very much looking forward to Christmas and just about ready.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Dec 2016, 10:35</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I really like your new glasses and I have a pretty good idea that they look really cute on you. Of course I am saying that based on how you have described yourself. Short with nice breasts, not skinny but not fat either, am I right? Anyway I can tell by looking at them that they should be very comfortable to wear. Very light weight. I just noticed that another on line site "eyebuydirect.com" was also doing a buy one get one free promotion, but I think that ended yesterday. Interesting hos similar the name is I wonder if they might be the same site but with a ULK home base? As much as you love wearing glasses I think getting a bit of a "glasses wardrobe" going is a fun idea.Even better when you can get your glasses at low cost. But until your eyes get stable and stop changing you still won't be able to really enlarge your collection too much. But it's still really nice to change glasses from day to day instead of wearing the same pair everyday. Glad to hear that Gemma is also planning on getting a pair or two as well. Even though she isn't into glasses nearly as much as you, she still needs her glasses full time so she should like being able to change her glasses from one day to the nest as well. Are you ladies ready for Christmas?  </p><p></p><hr>

I love them and they suit me so well! Gemma also loves them. She tried one of them on to see if they suited her. Obviously she couldn't see herself very well as our prescriptions are totally different so I took a photo of her. She was a little disappointed that they didn't suit her but might look for some different ones in the new year. Neither of us need new glasses but I want to expand my glasses wardrobe and Gemma is too, but by a smaller amount than me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2016, 17:51</p><p>new visitor </p><p>I understand your question, nut without any question you were asked to read the letters on the eye chart you apparently were unable to see the letter across the bottom few lines. This of course would indicate that you in fact need glasses to see things at a distance clearly. The prescription you received is on the weak side but at the same time just as you're finding out they do in fact allow you to see things more clearly now. It is not at all unusual at all that once oyu start wearing your glasses for one thing such as driving at night that you quickly find that they also help with driving during the day and then for other things such as sporting events, concerts, and even watching TV. You're not being forced to wear your glasses but you are simply finding that your eyes are more comfortable now wearing glasses for various things. It's not doing any harm for you wear your glasses as much as you like. Even full time is okay. I don't think they will be of any help with seeing things close up, but it won't hurt to try. If you're behind a computer a good part of the day you may find that since your monitor sits several feet away that your glasses actually help you. As crazy as it may sound most likely it was the close work that is the reason you now need glasses for distance. You may find that your eyes aren't as tired now as well. I would trust your ECP (eye care professional)   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>new visitor</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2016, 16:51</p><p>My eyes were getting very tired from close work, so I went for an exam. Dr gave a prescription for -.75 glasses for distance. I told her I don't need for distance, was expecting for close. She said not to get close yet because I don't need them badly enough and can probably wait a year or so, and that if I get them now I will become dependent on them quickly and really need them. </p><p>So I got the distance glasses, which I didn't think I need. When they were fitted on me and looked around, I really didn't see much of a difference but they told me to wear them particularly at night when driving. They made more of a difference then. So I have been wearing them often at night and sometimes during the day. I am now noticing that distance at all times, night AND day is a bit fuzzy and that particularly for distant small signs etc I can't read them without the glasses. It seems she didn't give me reading glasses because I would come to need them, but gave me distance glasses that are doing exactly that! Is this normal?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2016, 14:17</p><p>Mark, </p><p>You may find that your new glasses are a turn on for some women.  Men are not the only ones who are attracted to the opposite (or the same) gender by attractive thick glasses.  Depending on your preferences, you might consider ordering some low index glasses from Zenni, in a similar frame, as an experiment. </p><p>If you are in college, there are probably many of your fellow students with prescriptions that are stronger than yours. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2016, 13:48</p><p>Thanks Cactus Jack, I'm a big fan of your responses and much of the knowledge I have about optometry has come from you!  </p><p> </p><p>Yes, I ordered 1.67 index lenses, I wanted glasses with thicker lenses but I didn't want full-fledged coke-bottles. </p><p> </p><p>Generally, I have an interesting situation: definitely have a glasses (GWG) fetish from an early age (NO idea where it came from though, I've always had bad eyesight but it was never a big deal.

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2016, 00:16</p><p>Just got new, semi-rimless glasses in my -6.75 -.75 prescription. They're a fairly large frame, squarish, I really like them and I'm wondering if the edge thickness is acceptable. It's about 5 mm thick on the edge (obviously it's exposed due to the semi-rimless frame), they look fairly (but not terribly) thick to me and I'm wondering if 5 mm is an acceptable thickness.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2016, 13:52</p><p>supersonic, </p><p>The need for some prism correction sometimes occurs when you get older, there is even a name for it, "Adult Strabismus". </p><p>For maximum comfort, I think you should consider some glasses with BI prism.  The primary help will be if you do close work.  They will do two things:  Reduce your convergence effort and help your eyes learn to work together as a team.  It is even possible to order low cost glasses with low prism correction on line.  If you are interested, we can tell you how. </p><p>There is enough difference between your two eyes for it to be likely that without correction, your brain may be using your Right eye for closer work and mostly ignoring the the image from your Left for close.  The thing that can cause vision discomfort at all distances is the Astigmatism in your Left eye. </p><p>Without the Cylinder correction for your Left lens,  small text will be impossible to focus and see clearly.  However, your brain does not understand that it cannot focus the image, so it either tries - increasing discomfort and fatigue - or ignores it. </p><p>Contact Lenses cannot provide any prism correction.  A -1.75 Sphere only contact lens can correct your Right eye.  You probably need a Toric contact Lens for your Left eye, but they can have problems of their own and are sometimes hard to fit, satisfactorily.  Often a compromise is used by fitting a Sphere only Contact lens with ALL of the Sphere correction and 1/2 of the Cylinder correction or a -1.00 contact lens for your Left eye. </p><p>I don't think ECP "push" Contact Lenses, but they exist for a reason.  Some people simply prefer to NOT wear glasses and if it is possible to provide adequate correction with Contact Lenses, they will offer them to their patients. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>supersonic</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2016, 08:19</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for such a detailed explanation. I never thought that you might develop a need for prism correction as an adult. I am 30 y.o. by the way. </p><p> </p><p>I already have glasses which are quite good for me, as I said, I use them for driving, but this new script seems rather intriguing to me. Still don't know whether I should go for it. I am not a glasses person at all))) Why? Well, that's a different story... </p><p> </p><p>My optom said I were a "good candidate" for contact lenses as I seemed to have low tolerance for glasses. (Do they push CL on *everyone* these days? My RX isn't that bad LOL). </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, I will give a try to CL in two weeks time. I'm exited!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2016, 10:30</p><p>supersonic, </p><p>Not weird at all.  You probably have mild Exophoria.  That is a medical term which, in plain language, means that your eye want to diverge (turn outward), but that you can fuse the images with some effort. Lots of people have similar problems.  For horizontal "muscle imbalance" there are 4 terms, Exophoria, Exotropia, Esophoria, and Esotropia.  Exo means outward, Eso=inward. Phoria means you can overcome the condition with effort, Tropia means that you can't, no matter how hard your try. </p><p>The Eye Position Control System (EPCS) has three important parts.  The EPCS in your brain, the Cranial Nerves that control the 12 muscles attached to your eyeballs to move them, and the 12 muscles that move your eyes.  The muscles are arranged as 3 opposing paris on each eyeball. Any of the three  parts can be involved in Exophoria, but the general "diagnosis" is Muscle Imbalance, even if the eye muscle are "not guilty". </p><p>The EPCS is, in engineering terms, an Open Loop Servo System.  Servo systems are used for positioning things and there are two types, Open Loop and Closed Loop.  Closed Loop systems are used where precise knowledge of where something like a cutting tool is to a tiny fraction of an inch or mm.  Computer controlled Lathes and Milling machines are this type.  Open Loop system use "results" to decide what moves to make.  The human body has many Open Loop system and typically uses vision to figure out what kind of moves to make.  The EPCS uses the images from your two eyes to figure out how to cause the eyes to move.  Another important input is you desires or will. </p><p>When you let your eyes relax or your ECP alternately covers each eye, she is alternately interrupting the image delivery to your ECPS.  Without both inputs, your eyes can drift position and you see the images appear to jump, she sees your eyes "twitch" as your EPCS tries to center the images.  At night or with blurry images, your EPCS has trouble accurately keeping the images fused.  </p><p>I hope this helps a little.  It is a complex subject and not easy to explain or  </p><p>understand. </p><p>The main point is to not get too excited about needing a small amount of BI prism.  You may need a bit more BI in the future for maximum comfort, but it probably will not get very high.  It will not be very noticeable by others, but it will make a BIG difference in your visual comfort. </p><p>C. </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>supersonic</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2016, 08:57</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>I complained to my optometrist that my previous glasses were hard to get used to and I sort of had problems fusing the two images together. They always felt kind of weird, but I never had obvious double vision in them. It's just that I always have to strain eyes to keep them togeter... I don't know, now it seems hard to describe!  When I really strain eyes to see in the dark (theatre or nighttime driving) the picture can just shift slightly. </p><p> </p><p>The optician asked me to look at an object in her hand while she covered one eye and then the other a couple of times. Then she showed me a cross and asked whether it was well aligned. It was not: I saw that its upper part was not in line with its lower part. I could make the cross look one only when I strained my eyes. She showed me a couple of lenses, one was very nice and the other one made the two sections of the cross slide apart in the opposite direction. Then she said I had a weak muscle or something like that. </p><p> </p><p>I think I might have got this from my bad habit of unfocusing my eyes when I need to see clearly a far away object, as my right eye is rather bad and "prevents" me from seeing detail without a fuzzy hallo. I mean, I just make my eyes diverge to look only with my left eye. Sounds weird, right?</p><p></p><hr>

You strain the muscles to see distances. Your glasses help relax them, so that your real distance vision emerges.  If you wear your glasses for a while, and then take them off only to find your sight surprisingly blurry, that is your real vision without the help of straining muscles. </p><p> </p><p>There are no glasses police.  You can wear them as much or as little as you want.  It also depends on your physical and psychological comfort in wearing them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rona</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2016, 13:01</p><p>Thank you Cactus Jack, your explanation is very clear and the penny has dropped! I understand the optometrists comments now about wearing my glasses more. I will start to wear them more and hopefully get over that initial eyestrain. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2016, 12:53</p><p>Rona, </p><p>A person with low myopia (less than -3.00) actually has built in reading glasses that are the opposite power (+ instead of -) of your glasses prescription.  The problem with NOT wearing glasses to correct your myopia when you do close work, is that your Ciliary Muscles, which focus your Crystalline Lenses, get weak and out of condition.  This in turn causes the symptoms of early onset Presbyopia. </p><p>Presbyopia is the gradual stiffening of the protein that makes up the Crystalline Lenses.  It actually starts in childhood, but usually does not become a problem until the late 30s or early 40s.  But the idea that the symptoms of Presbyopia DO NOT occur until the 40s is a myth. </p><p>For their size, the Ciliary Muscles are normally the strongest muscles in the body. Their job is to squeeze your Crystalline Lenses to increase their PLUS power to focus close.  The amount of increased PLUS you need to focus close is strictly a function of focal distance from your eyes to the target.  The optical formula was codified by Sir Isaac Newton, back around 1700.  It is: </p><p>Lens Power in Diopters = 1 meter (100 cm, 1000 mm, or 39.37 inches) / Focus Distance. </p><p>If you do the math, a typical reading distance of 40 cm or 16 inches requires a +2.50 increase in your distance prescription.  A Monitor at 67 cm or 26 inches would require +1.50.  Without your glasses, your low myopia allows your Ciliary Muscles to be pretty relaxed for using the computer, and you can probably still supply the additional +1.00 to read, internally, without much effort. </p><p>What you experience as eyestrain, when you were your glasses for close work, is your Ciliary Muscles complaining that they are in fact, straining to focus.  That is because the muscles are so out of condition that they are too weak to provide the needed focusing effort, without straining.  The result is that you are hastening the onset of Presbyopia. </p><p>You really need to re-condition your Ciliary Muscles. I would urge you to start wearing your weakest prescription possible while working with the computer or reading.  After a few weeks you will hopefully  get to the point where you don't feel like you are straining.  Then go to a bit stronger pair of glasses until they are comfortable and then go to your full prescription. </p><p>With rare exception, the onset of Presbyopia is inevitable, but you may be able to delay it for a few years. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rona</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2016, 11:47</p><p>I am 31and work in a hospital, my role involves about 30% patient time and 70% time writing up clinical reports and research. I spend a lot of time on computers. I tend to only wear my glasses for driving, sometimes TV at home or at the cinema. I don't wear my glasses when I am in the office on the computer. I think my aversion to a higher prescription is a combination of things, one being that I don't want to feel dependent on glasses, silly I know but it's a psychological issue I've had for a long time. Secondly when I have left them on to read I end up getting eyestrain. I guess a lower prescription will help take the load off so to speak when reading with my glasses on. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2016, 18:46</p><p>Rona, </p><p>Some important things you did not mention, are your age and occupation.  Do you do a lot of close work. </p><p>The increases you describe are really pretty small.  The Cylinder and Axis numbers are very subjective and the deepened to some extent on YOUR ability to judge relative blurriness of images.  The Axis is very hard to determine for low Cylinder powers.  I have written a piece called "How to Study for an Eye Exam" that describes how to "fine tune" Cylinder Axis.  I have posted it several times on various threads.  You might fine it helpful for your next eye exam. </p><p>By the way, there is no such thing as a Worse or Better optical prescription.  The important thing is that the Glasses or Contact Lens Prescription neutralized or cancels out your Refractive Error.  It is not unusual for your prescription to change over time.  The reason for the changes are numerous, but the purpose of an eye exam is to find the combination of trial lenses that gives you the best possible correction.  If you are Myopic and need Minus Sphere correction, that means that your distance vision will be blurry if you are under-corrected.  In correct Cylinder and Axis typically means that Text is hard to read and often very tiring.  I doubt your ECP is trying to push a stronger than necessary distance prescription than her tests revealed.  Wearing slightly less Minus than you actually need might make close work easier, particularly if Presbyopia is beginning to cause a problem, but it will affect the clarity of distant images. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>George1968</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2016, 18:27</p><p>Rona, </p><p> </p><p>So, I am not sure what your issue with having your eyes fully corrected.  Is it because the full prescription means you have to weat glasses fulltime, or is it a comfort issue?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2016, 18:22</p><p>Kat, </p><p>Vision actually occurs in the brain.  Your eyes are merely biological cameras.  If there is a difference between the quality of the two images, your brain will select the sharpest image. Depending on the quality of the other image, it will either use elements of that image or if it is blurry, completely ignore it.  You have to have two good images to be able to see 3-D. </p><p>There is an Eye Position Control System (EPCS)in your brain that uses the images from your eyes to control eye position.  It needs two sharp images to be able to do a good job.  I dont want to get too technical here, but it appears that the EPCS uses Vertical Edges of objects to match images horizontally and Horizontal Edges to match images vertically.  If one image is very blurry, it sometimes cant match the two images and fuse them for you.  If that happens, you see two images.  Sometimes if you strain to fuse the images, they will actually get farther apart. </p><p>In your situation, you are using your Right eye for focusing close, which means that your left eye is probably blurry and using your Left eye for distance which means that you Right eye is blurry. </p><p>The first step is to get glasses that correct the vision in both eyes.  That may solve the problem, but it may take a little while for you brain to remember how to process two images rather than one at a time.  If you still have double vision problems, it may be necessary to put a bit of prism correction in your glasses to help you fuse the two images.  If the image size on the Retina is a problem, you could wear a Contact Lens  on one eye so that the glasses prescription in both eyes is very close. </p><p>The important thing is to not too worry, un-necessarily.  It is highly likely that the problems can be fixed and you will have excellent 3-D vision again. You are doing the right thing by seeing a specialist. </p><p>Please let us know the results and feel free to ask more questions. </p><p>I hope this helps, but remember your Doctors have the ability to find the actual causes of your vision problems.  They are the authorities on the subject. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rona</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2016, 07:19</p><p>Hello, been searching the web for information and advice and came across this forum. I had an eye test today as I was due my two yearly checkup which I have been putting off. Rewind to  approx 2 years I got what I felt was quite a significant increase in my prescription and even during the test thought oh wow this is strong and I got told I would get used to it. I got the glasses in the new prescription then but just felt they were too strong so I ended up just using my old glasses and my new glasses also felt quite heavy on my face as they were a chunky plastic design as opposed to a very light metal rim frame.  </p><p> </p><p>The prescription that I was wearing in my old glasses was   </p><p>right eye sph-1.00, cyl -0.25 axis 180 </p><p>Left eye sph -1.25 no other numbers.  </p><p> </p><p>My prescription 2 years ago was </p><p>Right eye sph -1.50 cyl -0.25 axis 180 </p><p>Left eye -1.75 cyl -.50 axis 15 </p><p> </p><p>The optometrist said my eyes had got worse. She wasn't very happy that I was wearing old prescription and after discussing why she agreed to write me what she called a partial prescription and told me I feel should be wearing them all the time.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2016, 22:48</p><p>Kat, </p><p>That is a bit more difference than is typical, but nothing to be very concerned about.  The eyes do not develop exactly together or at the same rate.  You are moderately nearsighted in your right eye and just a tiny bit nearsighted in your left eye.  In effect you have what is called natural Mono Vision.  That is where you read with your right eye and use your left eye for distance. </p><p>That can cause two problems.  A person with natural Mono Vision usually develop really good 3-D vision because it is hard for the eyes to work together as a team and the difference causes a difference in image sizes on the retina which can cause mild double vision. </p><p>I don't think you mentioned your age.  I also had natural monovision that was not discovered until I was about 14.  The difference was not quite as large as yours.  the major symptom was that I seemed to see quite well for both distance and near, but I could not play baseball, when I was young.  I could not catch or hit the ball, because without good 3D vision, I could not tell where the ball was in flight.  By the time I figured out where it was, it was past me and on the ground. </p><p>Even with glasses there may be a difference in image size on the Retina, but there are ways to help that, if it causes a problem. </p><p>May I ask your age and where you live (county)? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Miku</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2016, 08:53</p><p>Hi Kat, </p><p> </p><p>Perfectly reasonable question. I think what you need to consider is whether you see clearly through the lenses that you were given (or at least better than without them). </p><p> </p><p>Regards, </p><p> </p><p>M</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2016, 08:29</p><p>Kat, </p><p>Your prescription is perfectly normal, don't be concerned about that.  I think that it is more common to have different prescriptions for each eye than for them to be the same.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kat</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2016, 07:50</p><p>Hi, </p><p>I have a question. I just got my first glasses yesterday. My friend has glasses too, and she asked me what my prescription is. When I have her the paper the doctor gave me she said something that has been bugging me. She said she found it weird that my eyes have different prescriptions. I just wanted to ask if it really is abnormal for my eyes to have different prescriptions. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2016, 12:13</p><p>Carrie </p><p>So you definitely notice the difference between the prescription in your new glasses compared to your previous glasses. That of course is very understandable, but it's good that even though your previous glasses don't provide your eyes with perfect vision anymore,you could still get by wearing them in an emergency situation. I think you would agree that both you and Gemma would find it very difficult if not impossible to do your daily jobs without glasses anymore. So that makes having usable glasses as a backup very necessary. That was the reason I was asking if you tested yourself just in case. I am quite sure that Gemma could get by using her previous glasses as well if it were necessary. That also allows you both plenty of time to shop on line for any extra glasses you may want. Of course I know only being able to pick out your glasses looking into a computer screen won't be nearly as much fun as actually shopping for glasses in various optical stores. And you won't get the benefit of having an optician fitting them on you. But the savings is substantial enough to make going on line a better option. Depending on which outlet you use the savings maybe enough to buy 4 or 5 pairs for what one would cost at a local shop. </p><p>I was wondering if you had seen Danielle and Vicky since you and Gemma got your new glasses. Not surprising that Vicky would make more out of seeing your new glasses than Danielle. Danielle accepts the fact that she needs to wear her glasses in order to do her job but she really looks at wearing glasses as an unwanted necessity in her life. Vicky on the other hand not only enjoys wearing glasses herself but she appreciates seeing other young ladies wearing attractive glasses as well. It's taken Vicky a good while to finally feel like she definitely needs her glasses all the time now or her eyes feel uncomfortable when she doesn't have them on. Her glasses are still weak enough that i'm sure without them she can can still read small print okay. But if she were reading a book without her glasses it probably wouldn't be long before her eyes would feel the strain and the words on the page would start to become blurry. Also hard to believe but she has been wearing glasses full time now for quite a while so i'm sure now when she doesn't have her glasses on she must have that feeling like she is in a way naked. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;07 Nov 2016, 17:41</p><p>Soundmanpt - thanks for asking about us. Yes I am fully adjusted now and my vision is great! I have tried wearing my old glasses. It does feel a bit strange now I'm used to the stronger prescription but I could easily use them as emergency backup. I am just deciding on another new pair, this time from an online store. My cousin's old glasses could work as a backup but I think I might miss the astigmatism correction. </p><p>Gemma is very comfortable with her new glasses. </p><p>Danielle and Vicky have seen us in our new glasses. Vicky said Gemma's glasses looked cool and mine looked really pretty. Danielle agreed. Vicky said that although her prescription was much weaker than mine she feels that she does definitely need her glasses all the time as her eyes feel uncomfortable when she isn't wearing them. Danielle said, as she has said before, that although she tends to wear her glasses all day at work she avoids wearing them the rest of the time unless she really has to. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2016, 11:50</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I would assume by now that your eyes have fully adjusted to your new glasses and you're seeing great at all distances. Gemma's increase didn't seem to need hardly any adjusting for her eyes to be completely comfortable wearing her new glasses. Have you tried testing how well you're able to see after wearing your new glasses for several hours and then switching to your previous glasses? Do you think that you would still be able to see well enough to wear them if you had to in case something were to happen to your current glasses? Do you think your cousin's old glasses might work better as a backup?  </p><p>Has Danielle and Vicky seen you and Gemma wearing your new glasses yet? I'm sure they both gave you both some nice complements on your new glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2016, 11:37</p><p>Maria </p><p>When I didn't see any post from you on Monday or Tuesday I was beginning to think that maybe something came up and you weren't able to get away as you planned.  </p><p>So you seemed to have a really great 3 day weekend. I was thinking you were only going away for a day. So even better for you. I'm sure you needed a good break after what seems like a long season at your job. You clearly took some time in picking out the glasses you wanted to wear while you were away. You must not have wasted any time since you must have barely parked your car and you took off your own glasses and switched to what I think has to be your very favorite glasses to wear. The -3.75 glasses were the glasses you wore on your last trip to the city. What time did you get to the city? You wore those glasses the rest of the day including for dinner and even a walk afterwards. You finally took them off when you went to bed and then you switched to I assume the Silhouette progressives for a little bit of reading before going to sleep. After wearing your -3.75 for so long i'm sure that that using some add was very relaxing to your eyes? The next morning while your eyes were still fresh was the best time to put on your -5.0 / -6.00 glasses. I think you did good just being able to wear them for the following 4 hours. You seemed to enjoy wearing them and I assume that was the longest you have ever wore those glasses? Not surprising that everything looked small in the distance with them. Everything also must have looked extremely sharp, clear and intense? Of course you had no hope of being able to read anything close up wearing them.Your eyes were feeling tired because they were really working hard to focus even if you didn't notice it or feel it. You did the right thing by taking them off once they started to bother you were straining your eyes wearing them. That tired feeling was telling you it was time to take them off. So even though I know you hated switching to your much weaker progressives that was a nice break for your eyes to recover. I'm sure going from -5.00/ -6.00 to -1.00 was almost like not wearing glasses at all for a while. Then after lunch you again went back to your favorite pair of glasses. the -3.75 ones and wore them the rest of the day.What is very clear is that you are now so comfortable wearing glasses around people and you really enjoy any type of comments about your glasses. you clearly caught the eye of at least one guy that was clearly flirting with you. Tell the truth did your glasses really nee cleaning or were you maybe trying to draw his attention a little bit? So he must have finished cleaning your glasses if he tried them on, or did he just ask to see them? Even though you loved being told how blind you must be by him that really wasn't the best thing to say to a young glasses wearing lady. You even manged to get into a conversation about prescriptions somehow with him. The whole time you were talking with him and he still had your glasses you really weren't able to see very well because your eyes were adjusted to the glasses. It had to such a great feeling getting your glasses back and putting them on and seeing everything come back into focus again. How much fun is it to take off your glasses to maybe wipe something out of your eye or to clean your glasses and see everything so blurry and then put your glasses back on and see everything so good again?  So do you think he was hitting on you because you were wearing glasses? If you go back to the city again soon do you intend on meeting up with him again? You do know if you were to start a relationship with him you would have to always wear those glasses. anyway this night you never took off your glasses until you were ready to go to sleep. So I assume you may have been watching TV in bed and still needed your glasses to see? Of course overnight while you were sleeping your eye went back to normal. Then Sunday morning you again tried wearing the -5.00/ -6.00 glasses but a couple hours. and hen once again you went back to what I am sure is your favorite pair of -3.75 and wore them for a while and finally later in the day you started relaxing your eyes by going to the minus progressives and then finally to your own glasses for the drive home. I'm sure after having so much fun you can't wait to do it again. I have feeling one pair that will be making the trip again will be your trusty -3.75 glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>María</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2016, 05:16</p><p>Hi! </p><p> </p><p>Yeah, sorry, Soundmanpt! I have been meaning to post but I haven't found a moment. My weekend was great! I actually needed some time off, so I spent the full weekend at the city! I went there on friday, spent 2 nights at a hotel, and came back sunday night. I had a lot of fun! </p><p> </p><p>This was my glasses selection! </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://imgur.com/E2Xje2Q" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/E2Xje2Q</a> </p><p> </p><p>From left to right, my -3.75 Hugoconti favourite glasses, the low minus Pierre Cardin progressives, my -5 and -6 Continental Eyewear rimless pair, and my plus progressives Silhouettes.  </p><p> </p><p>I spent the whole time wearing glasses! I mostly used the Pierre Cardin and Hugoconti ones. I wanted to wear the stronger ones more, but after some hours my eyes were rather tired, so I switched to the minus progressives, and my eyes felt so relaxed!  </p><p> </p><p>I brought my ebook, so I used the plus glasses mostly for reading a little in bed (and when entering a few shops). On friday, as soon as I arrived, took my real glasses off and put the -3.75 on. I wore those for the rest of the day, to check in at the hotel, to dinner and to go for a walk. Then, when I went to bed I switched to the plus ones until I fell asleep. </p><p> </p><p>The next morning as soon as I opened my eyes, I put the stronger ones on. I went shopping with them, and it was great! I wore them for almost four hours! I had never done that, and it felt great. I could see fine at distance, everything was small, but clear enough to manage around. Reading not so much, but I could do fine. After a while, my eyes started to feel tired, so sadly I switched to the weaker ones. Anyways, those have a little of plus add, so It was nice too wearing them while shopping. </p><p> </p><p>After lunch, I decided to use the -3.75 ones, and I was able to wear them for the rest of the entire day! I loved that, it was so exciting! After dinner I went out for a few drinks, I wanted to wear the stronger pair, but I didn't know if I'd be out much, and I didn't want to change glasses again because of tiredness, so I decided to keep the -3.75 pair on. I had so much fun! I had some drinks, talked to a lot of people, and all of it wearing the glasses as if they were my real prescription. It was soooo exciting. Actually, one of the guys I talked to, tried my glasses on when I took them off to clean them, and he told me how blind I am. I loved that! I talked to him a bit about the prescription and such, while he was still wearing my glasses. And it was very blurry for me then! But soon he gave them back to me, I put them on, and the blur went away. It was a great feeling! We talked a bit more, and I kept my glasses on until I went to sleep. </p><p> </p><p>On sunday I started my day with the stronger ones, after a couple hours outside I switched to the -3.75, and after lunch time I switched to the weaker pair, so my eyes were relaxed for the drive back home. I struggled a bit at first with the weaker prescription, but after a while everything was fine, and when it was time to drive back, my real glasses felt very comfortable as always.  </p><p> </p><p>So, it was a very fun, nice and exciting weekend! I'll go back in a few weeks, with some other pairs for experimenting. I'm so looking forward to it!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Nov 2016, 11:18</p><p>Maria </p><p>I have been hoping to see a report from you about your adventure to the city and being able to wear strong glasses for a full day. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;30 Oct 2016, 12:31</p><p>Anyone taking advantage of Halloween to debut some wild or vintage glasses?  I went to an event yesterday and did a steampunk theme with these vintage glasses/goggles: </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/47355639@N00/29507149071/in/dateposted-public/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/47355639@N00/29507149071/in/dateposted-public/</a> </p><p> </p><p>It made wearing the costume fun and started a conversation about the one of a kind glasses.  Happy to have found a local optician passionate about vintage glasses and able to get my -16.25 lenses in them.  Glasses were part of at least one other person's vintage outfit yesterday.  She always wears nice looking vintage frames and was sporting a pair of large black frames I had not seen before.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2016, 09:00</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Well at least something to consider if you ever do need to get your glasses adjusted at some point. But I have a feeling that because you wear your glasses full time and I know you take very good care of your glasses that you probably never have a problem where your glasses become too loose and slide down your nose. That generally happens more often when people are putting on and taking off their glasses quite a bit. The hinge screws become loose doing that from opening and closing them so much. But I bet when you take your glasses at bedtime you don't even close them. That way their ready to slip on in the morning. So about the only thing that could cause your glasses to get out of shape would be maybe falling asleep watching TV with your glasses on. That one nearly everyone that wears glasses has been guilty of at least once. </p><p>Thanks for the update on you're friendly customer as well. I was only wondering because you haven't said anything about seeing her. Of course that is understandable since you haven't had any reason to discuss glasses since you complemented her on her new glasses which lead to a brief chat. Maybe when she sees you wearing your new glasses she will comment about your new glasses and you can tell her about the increase you got and how you felt a bit dizzy at first. By now I assume you're seeing distances as well as you are close up with your new glasses? Gemma never had any problem at all adjusting to her new glasses did she?  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2016, 15:36</p><p>Soundmanpt - popping in to different opticians to get my glasses adjusted/tightened by an attractive assistant would be something I would consider if I was single. Nice suggestion though but I don't think it would be appropriate and would be unfair on Gemma. I know it wouldn't be exactly like having an affair but it would be one step closer. Gemma is not just the love of my life but also my closest friend and I want to keep it that way. </p><p>The friendly customer comes in at least once a week always wearing her glasses. Quite often that is the highlight of the day, not just because she is attractive but because she is genuinely friendly.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2016, 11:29</p><p>Maria </p><p>So nice to hear from you. I was just thinking over this past weekend that it has been a while since you commented in her. The end of the growing season I guess requires a good deal of work too. So i'm sure you have been looking forward to getting away for one of your weekend trips for some time now. And probably not just so you can wear strong glasses all day long but you have to ready for a rest as well. Now you just have to pick out the glasses you plan on wearing. Are you planning on just wearing one pair all day or switching around a bit? Of course you know I will be waiting to hear all about it next week. By the way how far away is the city you plan on going to? Is it hours away or far less?  </p><p>Those new glasses you added to your collection look really nice. I get the idea that the girl that you got them from was on the shy side about being seen wearing glasses. So she picked glasses that are hardly noticeable. Most likely the -.75 glasses were her very first pair and the -1.00 was her 2nd pair. So she now must be wearing either -1.25 or maybe -1.50 glasses. She's getting closer to needing them full time. Without a doubt i'm sure they are so lightweight that you hardly even feel them when you have them on. I bet when you wear them after having them on a few minutes you forget you're even wearing glasses because you hardly feel them.  </p><p>Progressives can work as you thought also but in your case going from a strong minus distance area to a weaker minus add area wasn't what would work best for your eyes because even having a slightly weaker minus add would still be difficult for your eyes to see well enough to read comfortably. I knew if you found a pair with a rather strong distance area and a weak plus for the add segment your eyes would be able to see very good both at a distance, since you already have proven that by being able to wear -3.75 glasses, but now with a weak plus for the reading add those glasses would be perfect for your eyes. It sounds like you have been wearing them enough now that you even know how to sue them properly. It takes a little getting used to when you first start wearing progressives because you have to learn to only move your eyes downward when you want to read something. And you really needed to be very careful walking while wearing them until you got used to them. Many women have taken bad falls going down steps while wearing progressives because they look down and you don't want to do that.  </p><p>I'm also happy to hear that you have gotten brave about wearing glasses around your one town. It was just as I told you even though you had never been see wearing glasses before people weren't going to question you about wearing glasses. They would just assume that you just got glasses or that you may have been wearing contacts before. So now you should make a point now to wear glasses anytime you go out of your house. Actually I think you're really wanting people to ask you about your glasses now.  </p><p>Have fun this weekend!   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2016, 10:51</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Glad toy hear that you're eye's are getting used to seeing through a stronger prescription. I'm sure the difference is noticeable to you. If you think about it you had a rather decent increase when you combine the +.75 SPH and the -.25 CYL. Your first glasses were +.75 / +1.00 so the increase you just got is nearly as much as your first glasses were. So do you remember when  you first got glasses how strong your glasses seemed at first?  </p><p>You did the right thing by wearing your own glasses when you went for your eye exam. I assume that Gemma and you went to the same place you got your previous eye exams at. So of course you always should wear the glasses they prescribed to you. If you had wore your cousin's glasses and they would have checked the prescription on them and found it didn't match what was on your chart from your last exam they may have wonder why you were wearing glasses with a different prescription. Now they probably wouldn't have said anything considering the prescription was very close to being what you were prescribed. They would have only thought that you maybe lost or broke your glasses and someone gave or loaned you those glasses. So the difference between your glasses and the new ones was more than enough to make you say "Wow" when they put them on you. So since you enjoy having your hair brushed back and someone remove and replace your glasses I think you should probably stop in every month or so to get your glasses adjusted, don't you think? You do know that you can stop at any optical shop and have them adjusted? So if you happen past a shop and their just happens to be an attractive assistant wearing glasses working you may want to take a minute to get an adjusting done.  </p><p>One of the best things about getting new glasses is getting all those nice complements on your glasses.  </p><p>Have you seen the friendly customer that you really liked that was in your store a while ago wearing new glasses? She told you that she had gotten an increase and she was now wearing her glasses full time. She said she would be back in more often because she was working out of her house.  </p><p></p><hr>

It has ended now, so I'll be able to make one of my glasses trips next weekend! </p><p> </p><p>Soundmanpt, yes I'm starting to get brave about wearing glasses! And about the last pair I talked about, yes it surprised me! I thought progressives where plus to more plus or minus to less minus. I guess I was wrong! That pair fits me wery well, and I have been wearing it a lot. Yes I guess I could drive using those glasses, but I prefer to stick to my pair for that!

I like both pairs, as they are very nice, light and discreet. I'll show more pairs soon, including some strong ones! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2016, 16:19</p><p>We've both had lovely compliments from family, friends and colleagues about our new glasses. </p><p>I think I am almost fully used to my new prescription now. +0.75 doesn't look much of an increase when just written down but I find it quite noticeable. I find it most noticeable when I take my glasses off and putting them on. Everything does seem clearer. I think my eyes are still trying to fully relax all the time but otherwise they feel good. I walk to work so I don't need to worry about being able to see clearly far enough when driving but I think I am ok now anyway. </p><p>Plus Tony - I didn't ask the optician to use the full reading they decided to do that. </p><p>Soundmanpt- I wore my own glasses to the eye test and when I went to collect my new glasses. I love the cat eye style. So pretty and feminine. I am definitely one of those women who very much likes her glasses being removed and replaced and Gemma knows this. She also knows that brushing my hair back behind my ears after it has been untidied by the arms/ear pieces of the glasses feels incredible for me. It was lovely when the attractive assistant did it. It would have been a bonus if she had worn glasses. I don't think I would have wet myself but it would have been even more arousing. Obviously it's best when Gemma does it especially as it usually leads on to other things!&#128521;</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2016, 15:25</p><p>Grace- Very good news. And now hopefully her two younger sisters will follow suit. Children often will follow the lead of their older siblings. But your daughter might have discovered or will discover just how blurry her vision is without glasses.Did she make this decision on her own or did you say something to try to encourage her?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2016, 13:09</p><p>Grace </p><p>That's really good news. Seeing her come out of school wearing her glasses you had to be quite pleased? So you almost have to assume that she was also wearing them all during class as well. So you didn't say if she kept her glasses on the rest of the evening. If she wore them all day at school it's safe to think that after having them on that long that taking them off now leaves her with very blurry vision. So she may not be thrilled with wearing glasses but i'm sure she is a smart enough to realize how much they help her to see things. Now watch and see if the other girls don't start wearing their glasses too. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Grace</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2016, 12:55</p><p>My nine year old took her glasses to school for the first time today, and she had them on when she was walking out of the school!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2016, 12:11</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I was just thinking about you and Gemma the other day wondering how your search for new glasses was going. Even though there was no great rush for either of you to get new glasses since i'm sure you were both still seeing good enough with your current glasses. But generally once anyone finds out that their glasses are not really providing perfect vision they usually don't wait too long to get their new glasses. Your new glasses sound nice and I like the idea that they have a cateye shape to them. but i'm not surprised that they are similar to what was your current glasses. It seems once you get used to seeing yourself in certain style frame and it is comfortable to wear most tend to get the same style of glasses. There is nothing at all wrong with doing that. You've been wearing glasses long enough now that you know what style frames fits your looks best.  </p><p>Most likely that dizzy feeling you were getting when she was fitting your glasses was caused by the increase in your astigmatism. Even though it only changed by -.25 it can tend to effect your eyes much more than a change in your SPH. Some people can get astigmatism correction and not even notice it but others like you feels dizzy and even feels as if the floor is tilted and you can even get a headache from them. So the optician was very smart in suggesting that Gemma should probably drive home. The best way to know that it was the astigmatisms causing you the problem was when you tried on your cousin's glasses which had a +.50 stronger SPH than your glasses and you could see perfectly with them and you didn't feel dizzy wearing her glasses. When you and Gemmea went to pickup your glasses were you wearing your own glasses or your cousin's glasses? If you were wearing your own glasses i'm sure your new ones did feel quite a bit stronger than your own glasses. But if you were wearing your cousin's glasses the they should have only felt slightly stronger to you. There is something about having someone removing and replacing their glasses that seems to cause a reaction for some women. Good thing she wasn't wearing glasses when she was fitting your glasses or you might have wet yourself. So your eyes seem to be adjusting to your new glasses pretty well. As you know anytime you get an increase in your glasses your close vision will adjust very quickly but it takes a bit longer for distance to clear up completely. You're right that once your eyes have fully adjusted to your glasses you may want to see how well you're able to see with your cousin's glasses. I think you will still be able to see pretty well wearing them but just nit as sharp and clear. In other words just a little bit fuzzy. That will be because you will be missing the astigmatism correction you have in your glasses. But if something were to happen to your new glasses they would probably get you by. Still probably a good idea for you and Gemma to find another pair each on line as a backup and just nice to be able to change from one pair of glasses to another pair for fun. But if your going to get your "Carrie" glasses changed to your new prescription then you will have a backup. But a 3rd pair still might be fun.   </p><p>       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2016, 11:07</p><p>Plus Tony- Good luck on Tuesday when you have your eye exam.Hopefully it won't have to be rescheduled again. It is a pain for me when any doctor's appointment has to be rescheduled for whatever reason. </p><p> </p><p>As for me my ophthalmologist always does a dilated exam. She does it for all of her patients I believe. I wonder why some doctors do it and others don't. It seems to me an ophthalmologist might be more likely to do the dilated exam than an optometrist but I could be wrong about that.  </p><p> </p><p>And what is the auto refractor? When I get my close vision checked the tech puts in lenses that I am guessing is my current reading add to make sure I can read the 20/20 line. I have read that some doctors as a guideline use your age to try to determine your reading add especially if you are going there for the first time. </p><p> </p><p>And don't study too hard for your eye exam. You don't want to cram and give yourself a headache from studying too hard. LOL    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus Tony</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2016, 03:35</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Good to hear that you and Gemma picked up your new specs and that you found the fitting process as pleasurable as usual! I don't have much hair to brush away from my ears but I also got a little thrill when having glasses fitted. I imagine the dizziness was caused by your eyes enjoying the benefit of your new prescription and then having it snatched away again for a few seconds. How does it feel 24 hours in? </p><p> </p><p>When you had your test did you ask the optician to use the full reading from the auto-refractor at the start of the test or was that his/her decision? The reason for the question is that I'm finally going for my eye test on Tuesday and I was wondering whether I should ask them to do that. I'm not sure whether British optometrists generally start from the full auto refractor reading or not. Maybe I should ask for a dilated exam as I'm over 40. </p><p> </p><p>I'm fairly sure that I will be getting an increase. I tried some readers in various strengths when I was in a shop yesterday to try to predict what my increase will be. I found that distance was clear with my left eye (currently +1) at +1.50 and +2.00, required effort at +2.50 but blurry at +3.00. My right eye (+2) was best at +2.50.  Having said that I can still see pretty well with my current glasses and self testing with readers is always going to be a bit hit and miss because of the different PD etc.  </p><p> </p><p>Anyway I'm off to study Cactus Jack's eye test preparation notes to make sure that I'm as ready as I can be. Enjoy your new specs (and looking at Gemma in hers of course!).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2016, 10:44</p><p>We both got our new glasses today. Mine are similar in shape to my previous pairs that I got last year but slightly more cateye shape which I think is really pretty. I got prescription sunglasses made in an identical frame. The assistant that fitted my glasses was lovely looking but no glasses. She did the brushing my hair over my ears thing that I find very arousing. Like last year, at a different opticians, that brought me near to orgasm level!&#128512; As soon as she put my new glasses on my face I could feel my eyes working to focus with the stronger prescription. She had to adjust the ear pieces a couple of times and I got a little dizzy for a few seconds every time she took them off and put them back on me. She told me that it would take a few days to adjust fully to the new prescription and suggested that I either wore my old glasses to drive home or Gemma should drive. Reading with the new glasses is intensely clear. Distances are almost back to perfect. Actually when I concentrate I can see perfectly but if I look away at something else I have to start again. I probably would have been OK to drive but I took the lady's advice and Gemma drove us home. Once I am used to my new glasses I will try my cousin's old glasses which are +0.25 weaker than my new prescription and don't have any astigmatism correction. That might help me work out how much help the -0.50 astigmatism correction in my prescription is. </p><p>Gemma's new glasses are a sort of Wayfarer style. They look very nice on her. She also got prescription sunglasses made in an identical frame. I love it that she is still going for bold frames. When we first got together her glasses were barely noticeable. She was just so shy about wearing glasses she didn't want anyone to see she had any on, thanks to being bullied at school for having glasses. </p><p>We both paid a bit extra for thinner lenses. Not just for cosmetic reasons but to make them lighter which is quite important for full time wearers. </p><p>To answer some earlier questions: No, I didn't get my eyes dilated. The optician took the power of the test lenses up to the reading from the machine that tells the optician what sort of prescription power the patient needs. The reading was higher than the prescription in my glasses so they tried me with that prescription and after a few adjustments and fiddling around getting the astigmatism prescription sorted they were happy that I could see with the stronger prescription. It seems that this is my full prescription and probably won't need a change, or much of a change until my late 30s early 40s. The "+" is likely to stay the same until then but there is a chance the astigmatism correction might change. As I suspected I have always been more long-sighted than the prescriptions I was given. My full prescription would have been too much for me straight away and may have actually given me headaches and made me feel,or actually be, sick. </p><p>Gemma could see better immediately she got her new glasses. She feels that if she needs glasses all the time she might as well see perfectly even if it is a 0.50 increase. </p><p>I might get my Specsavers "Carrie" glasses reglazed with my new prescription as I am still very fond of them. </p><p>We're both still looking online for at least another new frame each.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael </b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2016, 13:35</p><p>Plus Tony- Chris is wearing her glasses much more than she wore her old ones. Which is good. But not much for driving.I took Soundmanpt's advice and ordered her a pair of single vision sunglasses from Zenni Optical and she   didn't like them. I try to help her and she doesn't like what I did for her. So no more. </p><p> </p><p>But she continues to wear cheap non prescription sunglasses when driving that might block out the sun but don't help her see any better. But she thinks they do and if something is in a person's head especially Chris' you can't get it out.But now when she leaves for work in the morning it is still a little dark out. What I don't know and I wouldn't dare ask her is does she wear her regular glasses when driving when it is dark out or when the weather is inclement. I would hope so because sunglasses sure wouldn't help her then. And her distance vision is way past the point where she could pass a DMV vision screening without corrective lenses and it is a good thing for Chris but not for the people who are on the road when she is driving that we live in CT and it is one of the few states that doesn't require a periodic vision screening when renewing your license. </p><p> </p><p>She had a problem and I had a solution but she didn't like my solution so I give up. Let her do what she wants to do. And since she doesn't have any money I paid for the sunglasses.Thank goodness they didn't cost much more than 20.00. She is so fussy. They are just sunglasses and  not many people would see her wearing them since they would be mostly for driving.No need for her to get an expensive frame like she did for her regular glasses. And Zenni Optical doesn't sell the kind of frames she would like because they are not brand names.But she makes no sense because the drugstore sunglasses certainly are not  a brand name. I bet they cost no more than 10.00. Probably even less.               </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus Tony</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2016, 11:58</p><p>Michael  </p><p> </p><p>Hope you are well. It was our previous discussion that I was thinking of earlier. Is Chris wearing her glasses now?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2016, 11:38</p><p>Soundmanpt-Excellent advice for Grace. Both returning to the store where the glasses were purchased and the idea of rewards. Offering children rewards to get them to do something may sound like bribery but sometimes you may have to resort to that if nothing else works. Parents I know have done things like that to try get their children to do better in school. Like offering them a financial reward for each A they get on their report card or rewarding them if they get all A's and B's. Maybe we need to start a child psychology thread here.  </p><p> </p><p>But once Grace's daughters especially the oldest and youngest ones begin wearing their glasses I am sure they will see the benefit of wearing them and hopefully will then wear them. I do worry a little bit about the oldest daughter because her glasses are going to look a lot different than most if not all of her schoolmates glasses and wonder if that will be an issue going forward.It also might not hurt for Grace to notify her children's teachers that her daughters have just gotten glasses and that they should be wearing them in school.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2016, 11:19</p><p>Soundmanpt- That has always been a pet peeve of mine and have mentioned it here many times and I am sure I said that specifically to Grace.My roommate Chris was very surprised when she went to an eye doctor who actually told her she needs to wear her glasses full time.When she asked me why she wasn't told that before by other doctors all I said is most of them don't say anything. They just hand you the glasses and send you on your way.I have found that to be the case most of the time both from personal experience and by asking other people who have gone for eye exams. </p><p> </p><p>It seems with Grace's 9 year old in particular she knew her daughter should wear her glasses full time given that she was prescribed trifocals but I don't think the doctor specifically said anything. And he or she should have particularly that we are talking about somebody being prescribed glasses for the first time.I don't think Grace had any idea how much her two younger daughters should wear their glasses. So the doctor should have said something to them too. </p><p> </p><p>This way Grace won't come across as the bad guy. She can always tell her girls the doctor said you need to wear your glasses. I wonder why these doctors don't offer advice. Children need to have things spelled out and often adults too. Doctors can write out a script but to most people the numbers aren't going to mean anything. You might as well write them in Chinese. So even adults like my roommate need things spelled out. </p><p> </p><p>I have often said that if you are prescribed multi focal lenses generally they are meant to be worn full time unless the distance script is very mild. But some people can't figure that out like my roommate. Chris thought because her other doctors never said anything that she only needed her glasses for reading.Doctors will offer advice if you ask them but why should you have to ask?  </p><p> </p><p>Why do doctors assume and it is not only eye doctors that their patients know more than they actually do?           </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2016, 10:56</p><p>Grace </p><p>In replying to "Plus Tony" I came across another thing you may want to do if they continue to refuse to wear their glasses. Just call the store where you got their glasses from and tell them that your girls are refusing to wear their glasses and that you're going to bring them in because you were told to come back after 2 weeks to have their glasses checked to be sure they are properly fitted. Tell them that you are going to ask when the girls need to wear their glasses while he or she is pretending to be checking the fit.  </p><p>Also another good thing to use as an award for wearing their glasses is taking them to see a movie that they want to see and again only if they wear their glasses for 4 hours before going to see the movie and during the movie as well.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2016, 10:46</p><p>Plus Tony </p><p>I couldn't agree with you more at least in some cases. I think the optician or optical assistant just assumes that the patient will know when tot wear their glasses. They don't seem to understand for someone getting first glasses they have no idea about these things. I'm sure Grace being new to all this just didn't think to ask while her girls were getting fitted with their glasses when they should each wear their glasses. If she had asked i'm pretty sure that he or she would have told them when to wear their glasses and coming from that person they would have likely done as told.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus Tony</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2016, 10:26</p><p>Grace </p><p> </p><p>I think Soundmanpt's advice for encouraging your girls to wear their glasses is sensible but I also feel that eye care professionals need to be much clearer in explaining when glasses need to be worn. There have been many discussions in here about the lack of guidance given by ECPs about when glasses should be worn. </p><p> </p><p>Bluntly your ECP should have told your 9 year old that she must put her glasses on as soon as she gets up in the morning and not take them off until bedtime (except when washing or playing sport) and that there is no choice involved. I know that sounds harsh but it really is essential that she wears her glasses full time and it should have been her ECP that impressed that fact upon her. Nobody is pretending that wearing lined trifocals when you're 9 is going to be great fun but the reality is that if she wears them she should be able to revert to single vision lenses within a reasonable time which will be much more cosmetically appealing for her. </p><p> </p><p>Your youngest's eyes are still developing at quite a rate and I would say that the same rules really need to apply to her too. Given that your 7 year old will only benefit from wearing glasses I would try to get her to wear them full time too. That way all three would be in the same position and although it wouldn't do your 7 year old any harm to wear her glasses less, by wearing them more it may make it easier for the other two.  </p><p> </p><p>I understand that the reality of getting children to do what they should is  complex and I hope the idea of rewarding them for compliance will work and that they will start to realise they need good vision all the time not just on the way back from the opticians! </p><p> </p><p>If it doesn't you may need to adopt a more hard line approach such as notifying teachers, other parents etc so they will tell them to put their glasses on if they see them not wearing them. I hope you don't have to go down this route but presumably their school will be expecting to see them in glasses anyway following their recent medicals. </p><p> </p><p>Good luck. I hope it works out. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2016, 09:49</p><p>Grace </p><p>Sorry to hear that your girls aren't wearing their glasses like you hoped they would. So you need to come up with some ideas to encourage them to start wearing their glasses. There are a few ways to maybe get them started wearing their glasses. Since you say that you always wanted glasses yourself you need to convince your daughters that your going to get your eyes checked to see if you might need glasses. If you haven't had your eyes checked for a while it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to get them checked anyway. Now if you do go for an eye exam if you complain about having trouble with seeing at night when driving that should get you glasses with a very weak prescription that you wouldn't have any problem seeing with, And because you have insurance they would be paid for. Otherwise you can always go to a boutique and pick up a pair that way but the quality of the lenses isn't as good. Anyway if you're close with your older daughter, if she sees you wearing glasses she will be much more likely to start wearing hers as well. Another thing you might want to try is awarding them. In other words i'm sure you know what all 3 of their interests are. So for example if the oldest girl likes going out for pizza you make a deal with her that if she wears her glasses for 3 hours before and while at the pizza parlor you will treat them to pizza. The more they wear their glasses the more they will each see the benefits of wearing their glasses. Like now it is getting close to Halloween so maybe make a deal with them to take them to a pumpkin patch if they wear their glasses for several hours before and during. Trust me after wearing their glasses for several hours the 9 and 5 year old girls will be very surprised once they get home and take their glasses off because everything will be so much more blurry even after wearing their glasses a few hours. Hope this helps. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>iDetective</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2016, 06:31</p><p>Yes, gwgs.  I did a little checking.  You are spot on.  "Grace" is a fake of someone else on this board right now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2016, 00:34</p><p>Grace, </p><p>I would recommend that your 9 and 5 year olds wear their glasses full time.  7 is somewhat optional, but wearing her glasses will help her eyes learn to work together as a team so she develops good 3D vision. </p><p>The 9 year olds need for trifocals is difficult to predict. In terms that are understandable for someone not familiar with vision and optics, she has been wearing very strong built-in reading glasses, probably for several years.  If you go to the Reading Glasses display in a local store, try on the +3.50 (the opposite of -3.50) glasses (probably the strongest they have) and that will give you an idea of her distance vision without correction.  I suspect that she has been used to holding books at about 11 inches or 28 cm to read. (BTW what units of measure do you prefer?) </p><p>The unknown factor at this point is: Can she develop the ability to use her Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline lenses to focus close  with glasses that correct her distance vision and DO NOT have an Intermediate and Close Add?  If she can, then the need for trifocals will ultimately disappear. </p><p>If her distance vision is fully corrected with her current prescription, (not always with first glasses) her +2.50 reading segment would focus at 16 inches or 40 cm.  Out of habit, she may want hold books closer than that to read.  Actually, that may be a good thing.  To focus closer with her glasses, she would have to use her Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses to add a bit of extra PLUS, which is a way to exercise her Ciliary Muscles.  It would be useful to ask her to hold a book at the furthest  distance where the text is clear, while she is looking through the reading segment of her glasses.  Then, measure and note that distance. That number is important for estimating any under or over correction in her current glasses AND for measuring progress in developing the ability to use her Ciliary Muscle and Crystalline Lenses.  That progress will determine when she would benefit from a prescription change.  You might be able to make a game out of monitoring and measuring visual progress.  More on that later, if you are interested. </p><p>I think Vision Therapy would be very useful for your 5 year old.  When she said that she saw two images, it initially meant that the the doctor wanted to measure any eye misalignment.  She may have occasionally seen double, but I doubt it had occurred all the time. </p><p>Typically, there is a check for muscle imbalance problem just after each eye is checked individually and the shutters are opened for both eyes.  There is a small prism device that is rotated into place and it is intentionally set to cause the patient to see two images.  The prism is adjusted to bring the two images into alignment, both in the vertical and horizontal direction.  The doctor can then read how much prism was required to align the images.  Ideally, it is 0,  If it is not 0, the doctor can read how much prism correction was required to align the images. Something your daughter said must have caused the doctor to investigate  further and prompted the inclusion of 3 BO in each eye. </p><p>With mild muscle imbalance, it is very likely that your daughter did not have much problem keeping images fused, but it probably required constant effort.  Typically, the fact that a person is having to work to keep images fused will be more noticeable if the person is tired.  It is very hard to spot, unless you know what to look for. </p><p>Vision therapy for mild Esophoria, where the eyes want to turn inward or converge, is painless and not hard to do.  One popular method is to put a large bead or small ball on a loop of string.  The string is then looped  around two pulleys about 5 or 10 feet apart.  The patient is asked to sit near one pulley and look toward the other pulley while looking at the ball or bead.  The patient can then pull on the string to move the bead/ball closer and farther away while tracking the bead/ball. Prisms with different values of prism and different orientations may be used to exercise and strengthen specific muscles.  In your daughters case, it is probably desirable to strengthen the outer eye positioning muscles. </p><p>Please remember that any thing we post is essentially speculation on our part.  None of us are on the scene and your ECP is.  She has the tools and knowledge to make the best specific recommendations about what is best for our daughters. </p><p>I hope this is helpful.  Please keep us posted on your girls progress and dont be hesitant to ask questions. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2016, 16:51</p><p>Grace-I will chime in first. I can tell you are disappointed that none of your girls have worn their glasses since the car ride home. All I can say is give it time and try to encourage them without being pushy. If you are too pushy it might have the exact opposite effect. The key to this is your oldest daughter. She is the one who needs glasses the most and if she begins wearing her glasses  I think there is a good chance your two younger daughters will following suit. Not sure what else I can tell you. Let's wait and see if other people have some different advice.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Grace</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2016, 15:17</p><p>Well. It has been a couple of days since the girls got their glasses, but none of them have worn them since the car ride home from picking them up. I don't know what to do. I do not want to push them, it needs to come from them. I mean if that was me I would be excited. It is a new look, like getting bangs. Growing up, I always wanted glasses, I thought (still think) they are so cool. Guess my girls don't share the thought. </p><p></p><hr>

Sometimes the eye doctor will undercorrect with a strong first prescription as they have,because it is easier to get used to. </p><p> Once you have a baseline on all of them,you should do a monthly recheck. </p><p> If their baseline is 20/20,and in a few months it falls to 20/40 or greater,then you need to get her back for another exam,as she most likely would need stronger lenses.{ Quite common } </p><p><a href="http://visionsource.com/patients/free-eye-chart-download/" target="_blank">http://visionsource.com/patients/free-eye-chart-download/</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2016, 13:00</p><p>Grace- I apologize if I implied that you are a phony. That was never my intention.I am sure all of your girls look great in their glasses and you wanted them to know that Which is exactly the right thing to do. The key is having them also believing that is the case.What Soundmanpt said about me is 100% correct. Let your girls know they look great in their glasses but no need to keep telling them. It would be like if you went to a dinner party and told the hostess ten different times how great the food was. One thing to remember about your girls.If they like their glasses and think they look good in them they will wear them. But if they don't wear their glasses it is fine to encourage them to do so without being pushy.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>minus5wholuvsgwgs</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2016, 10:43</p><p>Just a thought Grace glasses are so trendy have you thought about getting a pair of non prescription glasses yourself to encourage your girls ?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2016, 09:59</p><p>Grace </p><p>The fact that you're very close with your girls should be a big help with getting them to wear their glasses. Like the others have already said you don't want to push them too much but at the same time encourage them to wear their glasses. Actually a lot depends on the 9 year old and how she gets along with her glasses. If she quickly finds that the advantages of wearing glasses is so much better than going around without them then I have a feeling the other 2 girls will follow her lead. The fact that her glasses are going to make a bigger difference for her much more than her sisters should cause her to put her glasses on as soon as she gets out of bed. If she does that that is like her telling her sisters that it's okay for them to wear their glasses too. Like the others have stated the 5 year old is nearsighted enough that she is on the borderline for needing her glasses full time but because she also has prism correction in her glasses she really should wear her glasses full time anyway. The 7 year old came away the best since her glasses have about the weakest prescription she could have gotten. Yes like Cactus Jack said in way she has Mono vision because with one eye she can see distance perfectly and the eye she can see close up fine. So i'm sure she doesn't feel like she needs glasses at all and I wonder because her glasses are so weak if she will even be able to see any difference when she has them on. But wearing glasses full time if she chooses to isn't going to hurt her eyes. So mom if she tends to not wear glasses as much as the other girls it isn't anything to worry about. But I have a feeling if the doctor hadn't prescribed her with glasses she would not have been happy because she would have likely felt left out.  </p><p>And no I don't think you were being "phony" at all and I don't think Michael meant you were either. Just that by going on too much about how cute they looked wearing glasses might have seemed over the top to them. But i'm sure you were just being a loving mom. And even though i'm sure you're not happy about all of them having less than perfect eyesight and having to wear glasses you were very serious about how cute you thought they looked. Not only are your girls adjusting to wearing glasses but your going to have get used to seeing them wearing glasses from now on.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>George1968</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2016, 08:56</p><p>Hi Grace, </p><p> </p><p>Your 7 year old should wear her glasses for TV watching, seeing the board and reading.  </p><p> </p><p>Your 5 year old needs full time wear, at least until her eyes straighten out.  But, it is likely Kelly in a couple years she may need to wear full time. </p><p> </p><p>Even when your 9 year old works her way out of trifocals, she will be wearing glasses full time (or contacts) for the rest of her life.  I am surprised she hadn't shown any problems before now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Grace</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 23:20</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p>Thank you so much for the indepth explanation of all the girls' presctiption. No need to apologize for being long winded, you were very informative, and all this glasses and vision stuff is very interesting. Howevever, as they say knowledge brings more questions than answers. That being said, I will not overdue it, so here are a few questions/clarrifications.  </p><p>So, would you reccomend all the girls wear their glasses fulltime, or can one or two of them get along fine with sometimes? </p><p>You mentioned that my 9 year old's need for trifocals will likely disapear, and that at some point she should not relay on the intermediate and reading sections much, I am wondering when would you recomend she start doing that? </p><p>For my little one, the doctor recomended vision therapy. What do you know about that? </p><p>During the exam at the end when the doctor opened up both eyes and asked if she saw one or two images, she said two. So, I am wondering does this mean without her glasses she sees double all the time? </p><p>Lastly, if you can, can you explain what the doctor was doing/looking for after she said two. The other girls did not have that part. </p><p>Thank you, and now I apologize for being so long winded. Hope to hear back. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 21:38</p><p>gjassesmayb- Yes it is a very high first prescription.But overall you are considered to be moderately nearsighted. My guess is you have been nearsighted for a while and gradually it kept on getting worse. Did anything specific prompt you to get an eye exam? But your prescription is very simple. Just nearsighted with no astigmatism.And the vision in both of your eyes is almost the same. </p><p> </p><p>Seeing things in the distance had to be very difficult for you. I would definitely wear the glasses full time. You are well past the point where full time wear is recommended.Although the ultimate decision as to how much you wear your glasses is yours except for driving of course. There is no way you could pass any DMV eye exam without correction.What is it you are scared about? Having your friends see you wearing glasses for the first time? Did your doctor advise full time wear? I have found that most eye care professionals do not offer advice as to when a person should wear their glasses. But your glasses are going to make a huge difference in your vision. You may not realize just how poorly you have been seeing until you begin wearing your glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>And as I said your eyes didn't get this bad overnight. It was likely a gradual process that happened over a long period of time. But most people do visit an eye doctor before their vision gets to where yours is now. Your doctor probably wonders how you managed until now.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gjassesmaybe</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 21:09</p><p>hey so i came back from the doctor and she said i had a high first prescription??? idk this is what she wrote:  can someone please explain </p><p>OD (Right Eye) Sphere -3.5, Cyl. n/a.

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 19:42</p><p>Grace-Glad to hear you and your daughters are very close.I think it comes down to whether your daughters like their glasses. If they do and realize they can see better when wearing them they will wear them.And if your two younger daughters see their older sister is wearing her glasses that may help and encourage them to wear theirs as well.  </p><p> </p><p>It is also good your oldest daughter is OK with the lines in her glasses. At this point being able to see may be more important to her than vanity. It will be interesting to see what happens when she goes to school tomorrow. Does she plan on wearing them to school? Does the teacher know she is getting glasses? And how about some of her classmates? If they already know it might make it a little bit easier. Maybe the lines won't be as noticeable to other people as they are to you because you know they are there.  </p><p> </p><p>Back when I was a kid when I went for a checkup I don't think the doctor ever did a vision screening. At least I don't remember it. The only vision screenings I had were by the nurse in school.  </p><p> </p><p>Did the doctor recommend a large frame for your oldest daughter? I think that is the way to go when you get multi focal lenses for the first time no matter how old or young you are.  </p><p> </p><p>And as for my mother being in the examining room with me it might have been OK when I was 9 years old but she did it when I was a teenager too and I didn't like it but didn't have the nerve to say anything to her. And the doctor had no problem with it or would have asked her to wait outside. I remember one time he was examining my eyes and my mother actually said to me something like you mean you can't see that.I should have then asked to do the same thing when it was her turn to have her eyes examined. I don't think she would have liked it very much. When she had her eyes examined I sat in the waiting room.  </p><p> </p><p>Good to hear that everybody was involved with the selection of frames. If they help pick out their own frames there is more of a chance they will want to wear their glasses. I bet picking out the frames took a while for your 3 girls. Did any of the store associates try to help you?      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 19:36</p><p>Grace, </p><p>Optical Prisms are used to bend or change the direction light rays.   If you look at a prism from the side, it looks like a triangle.  The tip of the triangle is called the Apex and the side of the triangle opposite the Apex is the Base, </p><p>3 BO means that the Prism prescription is 3 Prism Diopters oriented with the Base of the Prism toward the Outside of the lens. </p><p>A Prism Diopter was defined by Sir Isaac Newton, of Gravity fame, about 300 years ago. He defined 1 Prism Diopter is that amount of Prism that will deflect a ray of light 1 cm at a distance of 1 meter.  Without going into the math, 1 Prism Diopter will deflect a ray of light 0.57 angular degrees.  3 Prism Diopters, Base Out is a very tiny amount, but it is enough to make vision more comfortable, if a person needs it. </p><p>If you look closely at your 5 year old's glasses, you may notice that the outside edges of the lenses are thicker than the inside edges by a mm or so.  If your daughters eyes are turned inward (converged) slightly, she will have to work a bit harder to keep the two images fused.  The Base Out prism in her glasses will do that work for her. </p><p>There are pros and cons to wearing prism correction, but your ECP is well aware of them.  She may need additional prism in the future, eye exercises, or even muscle surgery to reduce the need for prism.  At some point, your ECP may suggest that she see a Pediatric Ophthalmologist.  That is an MD who species in Strabismus issues in children and also adults. </p><p>It is very rare for small amounts of prism in glasses to be noticed by others. </p><p>Hope this helps a bit. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 19:03</p><p>Grace-I think your 5 year old  has strabismus which is cross eyed or a misalignment of the eyes. That is why she needs prism in her glasses. Honestly I didn't pay any attention to that when I saw her script. I looked more at her sphere and cylinder numbers. And Likelenses is right. Because of the prism I think it would be best if she wore her glasses full time just like your oldest daughter. Some of these words can be confusing or hard to remember but I think that was the word the doctor used.  </p><p> </p><p>Did this doctor do a good job trying to explain things? A lot of them don't. I still think he should have offered advice as to when your two youngest daughters should wear their glasses.It was pretty obvious that your oldest daughter would need to wear hers full time having trifocals but not nearly as obvious with your two younger daughters especially the middle one. Still not sure how much the glasses will benefit your middle daughter. And I don't think one eye being slightly nearsighted and the other one slightly farsighted is all that unusual.          </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Grace</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 19:01</p><p>Michael, </p><p>I do not know where to start. First off, thanks for your concern, my daughters and I have a very special relationship, we are really close. I do not think I was being phoney, or that they thought I was being phoney, it is just our relationship.  </p><p>My 9 year old did not say much about the lines on her lenses, she just made a little sarcastic comment. The lines are pretty noticeable, but I might just think that because I know they are there. She is a big girl, she will just explain that she needs trifocals to see because of she had normal glasses she would not be able to read.  </p><p>As for the mom in the room thing, I will admit I was in the room with all my girls. It just seems like something a kid needs to go through with their parents. Having a parent there seems to make it a more comfertable scene. I guess the good thing is if me being there made any of my girls nervous I am certain they would tell me. </p><p>Like I mentioned earlier, the girls failed the eye exam portion of their wellness check up. </p><p>The four of us picked out their frames together, and yes, we made sure the 9 year old got a nice big pair of glasss, so each part of her glassss would have enough space. </p><p>Likelenses </p><p>Thank you for your rundown.  </p><p>I have done my little research, but am still confused about prisms. I would greatly appreciate it if someone would explain it to me. </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 18:51</p><p> </p><p>Grace, </p><p>9 year old prescription: </p><p>OD (Right Eye) Sphere -3.75, Cyl. n/a. Axis n/a Add +2.50 </p><p>OS (Left Eye) Sph -3.50, Cyl -0.25, Axis 120 Add + 2.50   </p><p>Trifocal 50% Intermediate (or +1.25) </p><p>The prescription explains the need for trifocals.  The eyes have an Auto-Focus System that consists of the variable focus Crystalline Lenses, The Ciliary Muscles that have the ability to squeeze the Crystalline Lenses to increase their already considerable PLUS power  of about +20 diopters for distance, and the Focus Control System in the brain. The Ciliary Muscles have NO ability to reduced the PLUS power of the Crystalline Lenses to less than their fully relaxed state. </p><p>The way it is supposed to work is that the Crystalline Lenses are fully relaxed for distance and the Ciliary Muscles squeeze the Crystalline Lenses to increase their power by +2 or +3 diopters to focus close.  Because of her Myopia, your daughters eyes are focused at about 10.5 inches or about 27 cm,  She never has a need to even try to focus close. </p><p>There is no way to know how long she has been Myopic to this degree. It is perfectly reasonable to conclude that her brain does not know how or has forgotten how to use her Auto-Focus System.   </p><p>Now that she has her distance vision corrected,  She would not be able to see close things very clearly with out a trifocal Add.  Using the trifocal lenses (segments) may be a little awkward for a few days, but I suspect she will figure it out quickly.  Hopefully, it will not be long before she starts to use her Auto-Focus System to help with the focusing, rather than relying fully on the Intermediate and Close Segments of the trifocals. </p><p>Newborn babies dont see very well right after birth.  It typically takes about a month for them to figure out how to use their Auto-Focus System but they are starting from zero knowledge.  Your daughter probably is in the habit of NOT trying to focus, because there was no need.  It may take a little longer for your daughter overcome the habit. </p><p>Once she begins to exercise her Ciliary Muscles, they will rapidly become stronger.  In some ways it is like lifting weights in a gym.  You start with very light weights (the trifocals help with this) and many repetitions,  Once the muscles start to become stronger you move to heavier weights.  In a few months, your daughter may only need +2.00 in the reading segment and +1.00 in the intermediate segment,  Then a few months later, maybe +1.50 in the reading segment and +0.75 in the intermediate.  Finally, she may no longer need the Add at all, for many years. </p><p>Your 7 year old has a prescription of: </p><p>OD (Right Eye)  Sph. -0.50 </p><p>OS (Left Eye) Sph. +0.25 </p><p>She is very slightly nearsighted in the Right Eye and very slightly farsighted in the Left Eye.  The difference can cause the brain to use the Right Eye for reading and the Left Eye for distance, depending on the visual task at hand.  It is a mild form of natural Mono Vision.  Mono Vision is often used in adults whose visual system is fully developed, to avoid the need for bifocals.  However, it is not a good situation for a child whose visual system is not fully developed.  You need two equally focused images to enable the Visual Cortex to develop 3D vision and good spacial sense,   </p><p>I have some personal experience with natural Mono Vision.  I was born in 1937 and started school in 1943.  Back then in South Texas, school vision screenings were nonexistent.  I had no apparent difficulty seeing the blackboard or reading.  Little did anyone know that I was using my eyes independently.  The only clue that I did not see very well was that I could not hit a baseball if my life depended on it.  By the time I figured out where the ball was, it was in the catchers mitt.  The problem was not identified until I applied for a drivers training and flunked the eye test.  My first prescription was: </p><p>OD Sphere 0.00 </p><p>OS  Sphere -1.50 </p><p>I was using my Right Eye for Distance and my Left Eye for close up.  One of the big shocks I got when I got my first glasses was that the world was 3D.  I believe the fact that I had natural Mono Vision meant that my eyes were not used to working together, which lead to early need  for bifocals (20) and early need for trifocals (30) and perhaps some other problems. </p><p>Your 5 year old has this prescription: </p><p>OD Sph. -1.00, Cyl. -0.50, Axis 80, Prism 3 BO </p><p>OS Soh. -1.75, Cyl. -0.25, Axis 85, Prism 3 BO </p><p>She is moderately nearsighted and has Strabismus (general term for eye misalignment) and more specifically, perhaps Esophoria which is problems with convergence.  Hopefully, your ECP checked for symptoms of Amblyopia.  She might have a tendency toward double vision, which could cause the brain to ignore one of the images, this isnt a good thing.  She should probably wear her glasses full time. </p><p>I apologize for being so long winded, but there was a lot to explain.  I urge you to learn as much as you can about vision and symptoms of problems so you can follow your daughters needs closely.  Here is a like to a white paper about The Eye that you might find interesting, </p><p><a href="http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/scenario/labman3/eye.htm" target="_blank">http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/scenario/labman3/eye.htm</a> </p><p>May I as where you live?

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 18:28</p><p>Grace   </p><p> I was pretty close in your girls prescription estimates. </p><p> The oldest has a fair amount more sphere than my estimate,and only minimal astigmatism in her left eye. Part of the reason for the trifocals is because her distance prescription is so strong,for a first prescription,she would find that intermediate,and especially close up things would look very small without the trifocal segments.With myopia she is used to them looking very large.And without her glasses on she would be holding near work way too close,causing strain on her eyes.She may complain at first that near things look too small,but you must insist that she wear the glasses all the time,and in a week or so she will be used to them.Do not allow her to read without them. </p><p> The seven year old has a weak prescription,but is nearsighted in one eye,and farsighted in the other.It would probably be best if she wears glasses full time,and do not be surprised if at her next exam both eyes are nearsighted. </p><p> Now as for the five year old,her sphere is close to what I had thought,and her astigmatism is about what to expect with a first prescription.The fact that she has a fair amount of prism will require that she also wear glasses all the time,for distance,and near.She is very likely to comment,or complain about close up things looking too small,but like her oldest sister if she wears the glasses full time for a week or so ,she will get used to it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 17:25</p><p>Grace- I hate to be a pest but one more question. Did your girls pick out their own frames or did they get some help from mom? I am sure your oldest daughter in particular had some idea what she liked but might have been limited with her choices because she needed a frame that would work with trifocals.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 17:17</p><p>Grace- Another thing I just thought of. My elderly aunt who is now 89 years old when she was in her 40's I guess complained to the eye doctor about her intermediate vision so he prescribed for her trifocals instead of the bifocals she was wearing. She worked as a secretary and did a lot of typing using a typewriter which in itself tells you how long ago that was. She claimed to have trouble reading what she typed. But I don't think she ever got used to the trifocals.  </p><p> </p><p>I hope your daughter gets used to hers without too many problems. I guess the same rules apply for trifocals as for bifocals that you have to make sure you are focusing in the correct portion of the lenses.  Walking down stairs in particular may be difficult.Are the lenses in her glasses on the large size? Hopefully she will have a wide enough field of vision in each part of the lenses to be able to focus. Somebody here will correct me if I am wrong but I think for trifocals the intermediate part of the lenses is usually very narrow.I remember when I got my first progressives the doctor suggested getting a larger frame so it would be easier for me to get used to them. And I guess it worked because I pretty much got used to them in a couple of days. The key to me was to keep them on and not keep on taking them off and putting them back on. If you do that you will never get used to them.  </p><p> </p><p>Bifocals, trifocals and progressives unless the distance part of the lenses is pretty weak I think are meant to be worn full time. And your oldest daughter's distance prescription is not weak.It is very strong for a first prescription.          </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 16:47</p><p>Grace- One more question. What prompted you to take your daughters for eye exams? Did they fail vision screenings at school? That is what happened to me when I was 9 years old so my mother brought me to the eye doctor. And because I was going my sister who is three years younger than me told my mother she wanted to go too so my mother made an appointment for the three of us. But my sister didn't need glasses. Which is what my mother thought because she didn't fail her vision screening at school. But she wanted to go because I was going.I don't think my sister at 6 years old really wanted to get glasses.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 16:33</p><p>Grace-My advice would be not to make a big issue out of your girls glasses.If you overdo it it may come across as being a little phony and I don't think you want that. Just my opinion. You can encourage them to wear their glasses if they are not doing so but don't push it.  </p><p> </p><p>There does seem to be a lot of poor vision in both your family and your husband's but you seemed to have escaped. Hopefully you won't have to worry about it for while until presbyopia sets in and that may not be for a number of years since you are only 27. But presbyopia eventually gets everybody.  </p><p> </p><p>Did your oldest daughter say anything about the lines in her glasses? Her glasses are going to look different than any of her schoolmates in all likelihood and I wonder if that will be an issue. How noticeable are the lines? What will happen if any of her schoolmates ask to try on her glasses? That often happens in school when a student gets glasses for the first time especially if the other student wears glasses as well. Kids love to compare. And they will know right away that your daughter's glasses are different and may wonder why.  </p><p> </p><p>I am not an eye care professional but do find it unusual that your daughter was prescribed trifocals before bifocals. That may make them harder to get used to. But I guess he feels she needs a lot of help with her intermediate vision like when using a computer. But some adults have trouble getting used to bifocals never mind trifocals. And some people love progressives and others hate them. It is personal choice. The problem with standard bifocals is they are not good when using a computer. So those people if they use a computer a lot may need a separate pair of computer glasses. I am 63 years old and have worn progressives since my mid 40's and love them. Never had standard bifocals. But everybody does not share my opinion.  </p><p> </p><p>I knew this elderly gentleman who used to live in the building I lived in and we had a community room there with a TV and computers and when he used a computer his face would be so close to the screen it looked as though he was kissing it. And this man wore standard bifocals. His vision may not have been good enough to try using the computer with his glasses off but what he wound up doing wasn't good either. As I said standard bifocals do not work well for the computer.  </p><p> </p><p>And one of my pet peeves with eye care professionals in general is most of them do not advise their patients as to when to wear their glasses unless you specifically ask. I think they should automatically offer advice especially to first time glasses wearers but for some reason they generally don't. I have worn glasses since I was nine years old so I would know. Plus I have also asked other people when I knew they went for eye exams and most of them told me the glasses were prescribed and nothing else was said. Even as a kid when I went with my mother for an eye exam the doctor said nothing and it was my mother who always asked. And I dreaded the question because I was afraid one time the doctor would say I needed to wear glasses full time which I would have dreaded. But as a kid my eyes never got that bad even though I got my first glasses for myopia when I was nine years old.So nobody can predict how bad your girls' eyes will get.  </p><p> </p><p>And another thing I dreaded was the doctor let my mother into the exam room with me and that made me very nervous. Not sure why he did that. The doctor was examining my eyes so how could my mother help me? We often had our eyes examined at the same time and when it was her turn to have her eyes examined I stayed in the waiting room.          </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 15:49</p><p>Grace- I rechecked your posts and saw that your husband is nearsighted. Sorry about my mistake.I do think poor vision can be hereditary but sometimes it skips a generation. At this point I wouldn't worry about how bad your girls eyes will get. Because there isn't anything you can really do about it. Yes myopia seems to be setting in at a younger than average age for your youngest daughter. Which may mean it will eventually reach a pretty high level but nobody knows for sure.But good luck with your girls and their glasses. Your oldest daughter once she puts them on may not want to take them off. And your youngest daughter should notice a big difference in her distance vision as well so hopefully she will wear them.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Grace</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 15:47</p><p>Michael </p><p>Yes, my nine year old has lined trifocals, her doctor thought they would be easier to adjust to becasue the lines will help her figure out where she should look when doing certain tasks. The doctor did not mention anything about when to wear glasses for the younger two, for the oldest it is implied with the fact she has trifocals. I do not need glasses, but my husband does wear glasses, he is nearsighted. What I had said was that it is surprising our daughter needs reading help before us, but we are only 27, so I guess our time will come. Also, as discussed previously both our families are jam packed with glasses wearers, it is a miricale I have lasted this long. </p><p>The girls just picked up their glasses, they wore them on the car ride home, but took them off as soon as they got home. I guess it will take time for them to realize the benefit of their glasses. In the car my oldest seemed satisfied wearing her glasses, and I must say she looked nice wearing them, as did my other girls. I may have embarresed them out of wearing them for a while by going momma crazy over how cute they looked wearing them and talking about how glasses are so cool. I mean they are, someone has trouble seeing, and they "magically" enhance their vision. They probably also did not like having their mom ask them to read things to her. They will get over it, change is always so exciting, and what can be more exciting than a chnage that also helps you see better!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 14:50</p><p>Grace- I am assuming your oldest daughter is getting lined trifocals rather than progressives. Am I correct? She definitely needs to wear her glasses full time.  Your 7 year old doesn't have much of a script at all. Probably doesn't even think she needs glasses. The thing I noticed is one of her eyes is slightly nearsighted and the other one slightly farsighted.Was your 7 year old advised as to when she should wear her glasses?Your 5 year old doesn't have a horrible prescription. But she is nearsighted with a small amount of astigmatism with one eye being worse than the other one. She may not need to wear glasses full time unless she wants to. But I think she will need to wear them in school as well as watching TV and other activities which require good distance vision. They will definitely make a difference.  </p><p> </p><p>Your situation seems very similar to another woman Jamie who wrote here a number of months back. She had 5 sons who all needed glasses and they all seemed to have different eye problems. Including a baby. And all of us told her not to force her sons to wear their glasses because that may make them resist even more. And like you and your husband Jamie said neither she or her husband had any eye problems. Sometimes that happens. Just because parents have good vision that doesn't necessarily mean their children will.  </p><p> </p><p>Did you say your girls were going to get their glasses today?Make sure you keep us informed how everything goes. Jamie was a nervous Nellie and worried what she would do if her boys refused to wear their glasses.But the best thing to do is not force them. The toughest one for you might be your middle daughter because her script is so mild she may feel glasses make no difference in her vision.But your oldest daughter is the one who really needs glasses the most and if she wears her glasses that may make her younger sisters want to wear theirs as well.             </p><p></p><hr>

I did some research and found that most people start needing reading help in their early to mid thirties, she is 9. Is likely that she will grow out of the need before eventually needing it later in life. Her father and I do not even need reading help yet.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;17 Oct 2016, 02:42</p><p>It is not unheard of for a young person to need trifocals.  It can happen when a person, no matter what their age, has uncorrected myopia in the -2 to -3 range.  They have no reason to use their Ciliary Muscles to focus their Crystalline Lenses.  True Presbyopia is caused by stiffening of the Crystalline Lens, usually with age, but there is another factor in Accommodation to focus close, the strength (condition) of their Ciliary Muscles.  The Ciliary Muscles are like any other muscles in the body, they need to be used to stay strong and be functional.  If the ECP detects Accommodative response, they will often undercurrent the prescription in first glasses or prescribe temporary bifocals, to give the Focus Control System and the Ciliary Muscles an opportunity to get stronger.  If there is little or no Accommodative response, it may be necessary to consider trifocals.  Young children today have a visual environment that is more complex than distance and reading.  They also are using computer displays that are located about twice typical reading distance, making trifocals a good, hopefully temporary, solution. </p><p>The Focus Control System FCS) and the Eye Positioning Control System (EPCS) are very complex interactive systems with multiple inputs.  In engineering language they are Open Loop Servo Systems.  There is an interconnection between the FCS and the EPCS that cause the eyes to converge as a result of focusing effort.  If a person has uncorrected Myopia, it is like wearing reading glasses full time.  Depending on the actual refractive error, it may not be necessary to expend any focusing effort to read or see close objects, clearly.  In that case, the EPCS may  not be triggered to converge the eyes.  Typically the result would be double vision, However, if the person is young enough, they may not be aware that there is something wrong with their vision.  Remember, vision always occurs in the brain.  The eyes are merely biological cameras.  The brain's typical response to confusing images is to use the best image and ignore the other image.  In young children, whose brains are still developing, the result is Amblyopia which, if not recognized and treated by the age of around 6, can result in permanent loss of vision in one eye. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2016, 11:32</p><p>glassesmaybe </p><p>What are the symptoms your having that causes you to think that you might need glasses? You seem excited about the possibility of being prescribed glasses. If yo aren't sure and you really want glasses one thing you can do which will guarantee your getting glasses is too complain about your eyesight when driving at night, even if you don't yet drive. This will get you at the very least a weak prescription for glasses. Make sure to complain while getting your eyes examined by the doctor. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2016, 10:57</p><p>gjassesmaybe, </p><p> </p><p>You might find this helpful. </p><p> </p><p>HOW TO STUDY FOR AN EYE EXAM </p><p> </p><p>An eye exam is not like an exam that you might take in school and there is really no way to study for it.  However, you can prepare for it and learn about your role in the exam.  The best eye exams are a team effort between you and the Examiner.  Part of the preparation is to learn what to expect, particularly if this is your first eye exam. </p><p>One important thing you need to keep in mind is that the Examiner has no way to experience what you are seeing.  He/she has to depend on your answers to questions. </p><p>There are two parts to an eye exam.  The first part is the Objective part. This part consists of: </p><p>1. Taking a Visual History where you describe your vision and the kinds of problems you are having. </p><p>2. Checking the internal pressure in your eyes for symptoms of Glaucoma.       	This is one of the very few parts of an eye exam that is even mildly 		uncomfortable and the discomfort only lasts for a few seconds.  		There are two basic ways to do the pressure test. </p><p>	A. Using a special instrument to lightly touch your Cornea.  Not to                      worry here.  Before doing this type of test a drop of mild anesthetic will make sure you dont even feel it. </p><p>	B. There is a new type instrument that uses a puff of air directed against your cornea.  No anesthetic is required, but the puff will startle you.  The puff of air is harmless and there are huge benefits of detecting Glaucoma early before it can do damage. </p><p>3. Obtaining a preliminary estimate of your refractive error using an Auto-Refractor, or manually by using a small hand held instrument called an Ophthalmoscope or Retinoscope. </p><p>The Auto-Refractor is a relatively new instrument that was developed in conjunction with NASA to check Astronauts vision in space.  You look into the machine with each eye individually at a scene or a pattern and the machine will adjust its internal lenses to focus the image you see on your retina.  The Auto-Refractor only takes a few seconds for each eye and it then prints out your estimated prescription. </p><p>Some Examiners prefer to use manual methods that have been used for many years.  Using an Ophthalmoscope or Retinoscope and a Trial Lens set or a Phoropter (a fancy machine with a built in lens set), the Examiner will look into your eyes and select the lenses that allow him to see your retina, most clearly. </p><p>The object of this part of the exam is to get a starting place for the Subjective part of the exam where you have to describe what you see. </p><p>Typically the Subjective part of the exam starts with the Right Eye shutter open and the Left Eye shutter closed. </p><p>Step 1 is typically determining the cylinder and axis of any Astigmatism correction you need. This is actually the hardest part of the exam because you will be asked to judge relative blurriness of two images rather than the sharpness of an image. </p><p>You will be shown a line of text and a supplemental lens will be rotated into place.  This lens is a cylinder lens that is mounted on a 45 degree pivot and can be flopped back an forth to bracket a trial axis or orientation of the long axis of the cylinder lens.  The thing that is confusing about this test is that the straight lines (strokes) of the letters will alternate in clarity as the lens is flipped back and forth depending on their direction.  I suggest concentrating on an O if possible.  Depending on your answers, the examiner will adjust the axis knob unit the image you see is equally blurry with the supplemental lens 45 degrees each side of the selected axis. </p><p>At this point the Examiner will probably swing the supplemental lens out of the way and may change the cylinder power while asking you which lens in clearer. </p><p>You may be uncomfortable, for your first exam, asking the Examiner to let you fine tune the axis, but I have found that most will appreciate your wanting to actively participate.  The way that works is that he will place your hand on the Axis control knob and you move it back and forth a few degrees of the sharpest image, this time. </p><p>The next step is determining the Sphere correction.  This is an easy part of the exam because all you have to do is pick the sharpest image, but there is a tricky part.  Your auto-focus mechanism will try to help, if it gets a chance.  The Examiner has a couple of ways to minimize the action of your ciliary muscles and crystalline lenses. </p><p>The Examiner can in effect sneak up on your Sphere prescription or he can use drops to Dilate your eyes. Lets talk about sneaking up on your prescription first.  There are actually 4 lenses in your eyes lens system.  All of them are PLUS lenses and the total power is about +56 diopters.  The only variable focus lens is the crystalline lens whose PLUS power is controlled by your ciliary muscles.  For distance, your Crystalline lens is fully relaxed and has somewhere around +15 diopters.  When you focus to read, your Ciliary Muscles squeeze the Crystalline lens to increase its PLUS power by the amount necessary to focus which depends on the distance to the object. </p><p>This will take a little thought to get your mind around, but if you are nearsighted, your lens system has too much PLUS for the distance from the lens system to your retina and you need MINUS lenses to neutralize some of that excess PLUS power.  You ONLY have the ability to increase the PLUS power of your lens system.  You have NO ability to reduce the PLUS power of your Crystalline lenses more that fully relaxed. </p><p>To try to keep your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline lenses from getting in the act, the examiner will start with NOT ENOUGH MINUS or TOO MUCH PLUS (same thing) and gradually increase the MINUS one or two steps at a time, while reducing the size of the line you are asked to read. He will not tell you what power lens or what line you are looking at.  Eventually, he will reach the 20/20 line and a lens power that lets you read it with no mistakes. </p><p>He will then follow the same procedure with your Left Eye. </p><p>When he has completed both eyes, he will open the shutters and you may see two images.  This part of the test is to check your muscle balance using some prisms.  He will probably ask you to tell him when the two images are aligned horizontally and then vertically.  While the images are separated, you have an important check to make.  Compare the sharpness of the two images.  If they are not equally sharp, be sure and tell the Examiner which image is clearer.  If there is a difference, he will likely reduce the sharpness of the clearest image until they match.  The important thing at this point is that they match.  That lack of sharpness will be corrected in the next phase with both eyes working together. </p><p>Next he will fuse the images so both eyes are working together and repeat the Sphere procedure by gradually increasing the MINUS or decreasing the PLUS until you see the smallest line of letters very clearly. </p><p>That pretty much completes the exam except for checking your near vision with a small chart about 14 to 16 inches from you. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2016, 07:52</p><p>Grace - if this is Grace, on this board where not everyone is who they say they are, I'm beginning to wonder about this. The appointment with the eye doctor seems remarkably quick after the original posts on here and to be prescribed trifocals after the comments on bifocals for a young kid is an extremely rare occurrence and something I would've thought any practicing optician would want to ease their patient/client into instead of giving it to one as a first time wearer. At least see how she gets on with her first glasses before this . If it is genuine then my apologies!! </p><p> </p><p>The other thing that got me wondering is the comments on bifocals and now suddenly the optician has prescribed trifocals - which are incredibly rare - as a first time prescription. These will definitely take some getting used to but again, if his is a bona fide user / post I hope they are what your daughter needs. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Grace</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2016, 07:02</p><p>Well, the girls had their appointment yesterday, and we are going glasses shoping for them today. Either later today or tomorrow my girls will have their first glasses. I guess, if what likelenses has said is true, then the uounger two will be taking off their glasses for reading. My oldest will have to keep them on at all times, the doctor said her glasses will have a part for distance, intermediate, and near vision.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2016, 00:17</p><p>To Grace </p><p> Some eye care practitioners will recommend bifocals to slow down progressive myopia. The ones that do not, usually recommend wearing the glasses for close work if the Prescription is -3.00 or greater,because reading without the glasses would require holding the reading material too close,causing strain.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2016, 14:14</p><p>I would say having bifocals is another ridiculous point that is being made and only her optician should advise what prescription and type of lenses her children should wear. </p><p> </p><p>Having done GOC (see other thread Grace if you want an explanation of this) quite a few times and having a few pairs of bifocals in my collection, I have found bifocal lenses are a severe distraction if they are not needed and make things in the distance appear more blurry and the small print close not as clear as it would normally be. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>To Grace </b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2016, 12:24</p><p>It is hard to predict what will happen, but I would suggest having them either take their glasses off when reading/ close tasks or getting bifocals to help alleviate the near demand. Also with all getting glasses together they probably will adapt well and can support each other </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark </b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2016, 10:56</p><p>Grace - this is why I posted, as after reading some of the posts I was concerned about reading it from the view of a parent but hopefully cactus Jack's post and mine were comforting to you and as Cj has said, one cannot speculate on something that hasn't happened in the future, it's like asking what the weather will be like in 5 years time on a certain day.  </p><p> </p><p>I think the most important factor is like any medical ailment and that is if it needs treating don't ignore it as it could get worse. Hope this helps </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Grace</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2016, 10:19</p><p>Thank you guys, likelenses' post really had me upset, and anxious. Tgise numbers he gave were big, and those glasses he linked were really thick. Thank you for clarifying everything.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2016, 07:39</p><p>I would like to suggest that trying to predict future prescriptions is a bit like fortune telling by examining tea leaves.  It may be fun, but it had little practical value. </p><p>We really don't know the exact cause of Myopia, Hyperopia, or Astigmatism.  We can infer from empirical evidence that genetics play a huge role, but the visual environment is also an important factor. </p><p>I would like to suggest that some of the posts in response to Grace's questions were not beneficial and probably caused her some upset and confusion.  One implied that extreme Myopia was inevitable for all her daughters.  Another suggested that vision correction was unnecessary and undesirable until mid teens.  </p><p>The cold equations of optics indicate that if a person has -1.00 of myopia, things beyond 1 meter or about 40 inches are increasingly blurry.  -2.00 = 0.5 meters or 20 inches. -3.00 = 0.33 meters or about 13 inches.  How can a child learn much of anything, if their visual world is a meter or less.  Children with Hyperopia have an advantage because they can correct most out-of-focus situations, internally, unless they also have Astigmatism or they are not able to use their Ciliary Muscles or Crystalline Lenses, effectively. </p><p>The point to all this is that Grace really needs to make sure that her daughters have good vision.   It is estimated that 80% of human leaning is acquired through the visual channel.  There was an ad a few years ago with the tag line: "A mind is a terrible thing to waste".  Learning and mental development depend on good vision and learning is vital in our increasingly high tech world.  If it takes Minus, Plus, or Bifocal glasses to provide good vision, so be it.  Cosmetics and Vanity be damned.  Learning from 4 or 5 to age 25 is vital to the long term welfare and life experiences of a person.  Can a person have a good life without good vision? Yes! But, it is a lot easier with good vision. </p><p>Enough said. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mark</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2016, 01:30</p><p>I dont necessarily go along with Likelenses theory as although lots of the posts on here are informative, how many short sighted people ACTUALLY get an increase of -1 every year until they are 20? I would hazard a guess at very few as otherwise they would be a huge amount of highly myopic people in the world, and if i recall correctly from a post on a blog of a highly myopic woman who was wanting to get lasik, according to her eye doctor, only 1/8th of glasses wearers have a prescription above -9. This seems quite a high statistic from my everyday viewing of the glasses population though. </p><p> </p><p>I wouldnt want any of what been posted on here to detract from you looking after your children and their vision and as an example, an Asian girl who used to work with me who had very strong glasses (just about to get -13 glasses when she left) has a young son who is probably just under 5 and whilst he got glasses at 3, whenever ive seen him and my work colleague, his glasses havent changed. Can anyone cross relate this to the original post as it may help.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2016, 20:54</p><p>Grace </p><p> Assuming that the nine year old gets a first prescription of -3.00,and as many experience an increase of an average of -1.00 per year,at age twenty her lenses would be -14. </p><p> And if the five year old gets a first prescription of -2.00,with the same progression of -1.00 per year would be -17. </p><p> The seven year old may be better off.If her first prescription is -.75,she MAY have smaller increases.She may wind up at age twenty with -9.75. </p><p> Keep in mind,these are only estimates,but because all the girls are starting out younger than many children,and two with unusually high  prescriptions,and high myopia does appear to run in the family on both sides,my guess is that all will require strong thick lenses by their twenties. </p><p> When you take them to the optometrist,you should ask him,or her about these things,and please keep us informed as to what their actual prescriptions are. </p><p> When lenses for myopia reach around -9.00 and above, the front surfaces are usually perfectly flat,and due to the lense thickness they have white rings that are noticable.The strong lenses also make the eyes appear very small,and when looking straight on at the person,their outer face is somewhat distorted by the lense power.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2016, 14:39</p><p>I would like to add that wearing glasses is not mandatory for anyone, especially kids. Glasses do not stop myopia, neither decrease it, they are just a way to see clear when needed. Children that age can perfectly play, study, do sports ecc... with the small degree of myopia reported by the Grace's daughters. The oldest may have troubles with the board, but only if her desk is far from it. Even recognising people may not be easy, but this is rarely a problem for children. They don't have to drive, navigate alone,recognize labels, read signs ecc... Moreover wearing glasses full time including reading and close works is thought by many eyedoctors as a bad idea, since myopic eyes can perfectly see close things with less strain than a normal eye (which is able to see clear in the distance, but needs accommodation for close vision). </p><p>Having said that, I would not force a child younger than, say, 14 to wear glasses. It is possible that Grace's daughter will appreciate a good vision and will ask for glasses to wear full time (anyway not for reading!), but it is also possible that they will prefer to cope with their small defect until impact on their social life will be significant (which could happen soon for the older daughter, unfortunately) and I don't see any drawback on this.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2016, 12:02</p><p>Grace </p><p>What "Likelenses" has already told you is pretty much dead on. For the older 2 girls i'm sure glasses are going to make a big difference to them in their ability to see properly. Of course they think they are seeing fine because they have nothing to compare their vision to. So the way they are seeing, or not really seeing, they just assume that is the way everyone sees. That being said hopefully once they put their glasses on and suddenly are shocked at how clear everything is they may not be so opposed to wearing their glasses. The one that needs glasses the least should even notice enough difference to cause her to want to wear her glasses and also if she sees her older sisters wearing their glasses all the time she is almost certain to want to follow their lead and she may decide to wear her glasses all the time as well. Most likely your daughters acquired the genes for their eyesight from your husband since you apparently don't wear glasses. If your daughters still are reluctant about wearing their glasses one thing that might help is for you to go a boutique that sells fake glasses and buy a pair of them to wear. If your daughters see you wearing glasses that should make a big difference to them. Like "Likelenses" said until your daughters reach their mid twenties you can expect that all 3 daughters are going to require new glasses every year as their eyesight continues to change.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Grace</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2016, 09:25</p><p>I actually mentioned the 5 year old before the 7 year old. In my family, my grandma, and a cousin have some really strong looking glasses. My husband has normal glasses, but a lot of his family have pretty thick lenses. One of his brothers, and a niece have such thick lenses that you can barely even see their eyes through all the lens, and when you can (when looking straight into their eyes) their eyes look so small behind the glasses. He also has another niece that has these really strong looking glassss with circles in the mddle, and they make her eyes look so tiny.  </p><p>So, will my girls have to wear their glasses all the time? Even when reading? What would happen if they are too close to a computer screen, or study/read too long before finally taking a break? My girls love reading and my 9 year old is always studying/ doing homework. </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;13 Oct 2016, 22:16</p><p>Grace </p><p> I assume that the 9 year old is the one that could not read the big E,and the 7 year old was the next that you spoke of,and 5 year old the last one. </p><p> If that is the case,that would be about right for their respective ages.The only thing that I can add is that all three prescriptions would be rather high ,for their first ones. </p><p> Not that it is carved in stone,but usually myopia sets in about 8,to ten years of age,and progresses until the twenties. </p><p> Since two of the girls have become myopic earlier,and one has such a large amount,they all will probably be very myopic with high prescriptions, by their twenties. </p><p> When they get their glasses,there are a few things that you can do to possibly slow down the progression. </p><p> 1. Monitor their reading distance,and insist that they hold books,or other reading material NO CLOSER THAN 12 INCHES,and when working on a computer,NO CLOSER THAN 20 INCHES. </p><p> 2. Do not allow them to do close tasks for hours on end.They need to take frequent breaks from close work,and do something that utilizes distance viewing. </p><p> 3. If you notice them squinting while wearing their glasses,get their eyes examined,as they would be a at point of needing stronger lenses. </p><p> Myopia is hereditary,and it seems that there is a lot on both sides of the family.Do any of the family members have what looks like very strong,thick lenses?  </p><p> Hope this has been helpful.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Grace</b>&nbsp;13 Oct 2016, 21:40</p><p>Yes, it does. My husband is nearsighted, and in my family my grandma, both grandpas, four aunts, two uncle, two of my three sisters, (I think) 9 of my cousins and all but three of my nieces and nephews are nearsighted. Most of my husbands family wear glasses except his mom, a cousin and a nephew. My oldest is 9, middle is 7 and youngest is 5.  </p><p>Even with all of these nearsighted people in my family, I do not know much about prescription numbers and how bad really bad eyesight/ prescription numbers are.

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;13 Oct 2016, 17:36</p><p>Grace </p><p> The one that could not read the big E most likely has about 20/300 vision,and will have pretty strong lenses of about -3.00,and will need to wear them all the time. </p><p> The second one is not far behind,with approx.20/200 and her lenses will be in the neighborhood of -2.00,and she too should war glasses all the time. </p><p> The third is around 20/40, and her Prescription should be around -.75 that she will only need for TV,sporting events ,and the board at school. </p><p> These numbers are only estimates,and other factors could include astigmatism. </p><p> Does myopia,or more commonly called nearsightedness,run in your family? </p><p> It would also be helpful to know their ages. </p><p> Myopia does increase with age,so all of their prescriptions will increase every year until they are in their twenties.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Grace</b>&nbsp;13 Oct 2016, 17:09</p><p>Looks like my little girls will be getting glasses soon. They failed the eyechart part of their annual wellness checkups. One of them did not even get the big E correct. She said it was three lines, and only went as far as the second line before admiting she could not see. The doctor made her move forward ten feet, and she was able to get the big E correct, and attempted the second line, but could not make out the first letter at all, and got the seond letter wrong. My other daughter did slightly better. She was able to make it down to the the third line without making a mistake, and got two correct on the fourth line. The middle one did the best, but she too will need glasses.She was able to make it until the green line, but messed up on the line below the green line. They are all bummed out by the news. Bone if them want glasses. They are refusing that they are having trouble seeing, and trying to get me to not get them appointments with an eye doctor. Any tips on how to get them excited about this? How bad do their vision look,are they normalish (well, for people that are nearsighted)?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2016, 23:37</p><p>Carrie </p><p>  Wow,what a nice hefty increase,with some more cylinder as frosting on the cake. </p><p>  As I had predicted at your last increase,at the rate you are going,considering your age,you should be getting a first bifocal [prescription slightly before turning thirty.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jim H</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2016, 20:33</p><p>Carrie </p><p>That is fun going for eye exams together!  I was able to this recently do that with my wife, however the outcome was not the same as both of our prescriptions stayed the same.  I was hoping my wifes would increase a little but she stayed at +2.50 with -0.75 astigmatism.  She is also very pregnant which I have read can tend to shift eyesight towards more minus so I should just be thankful it didn't go down!  She is excited to get new glasses so we may go shopping soon depending on how things are going with her. </p><p>I am surprised with the increase you got.  Did you get your eyes dilated for this exam?  That will feel like quite an increase when you get them.  Enjoy shopping with Gemma</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus Tony</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2016, 10:53</p><p>Carrie </p><p> </p><p>Good to hear how you and Gemma got on. Based on your experience with the slightly stronger glasses I'd guessed that they might have given you an extra 0.25 or maybe 0.5 but 0.75 seems quite a lot (my guess was based on the typical British optician's apparent preference to under-prescribe).  </p><p> </p><p>I hope you like the extra power when you get it and that your distance vision doesn't take too long to become crisp and clear. I wonder if the little bit of extra cylinder will take any getting used to? I am sure that your lenses will look great on you whether you choose standard or thinner ones and I have no doubt that the same will be true for Gemma. I think the frame is the most important thing anyway as that is what people notice when they see you.  I was with a friend who is about -6 the other day and someone asked her if she was long or shortsighted. After she had answered, they asked me the same question . Most people in here would have realised that we had completely different types of prescription but in the real world I don't think many people can tell (including the vast numbers of people who never even ask for a copy of their prescription!).  </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if you have always been a bit more longsighted than the amount that your glasses corrected? I guess it is possible that they have been working you up to your full correction over the last few years or maybe it is simply that your eyes have gradually changed to get to your current prescription. Did your optometrist ever say anything about that? It is a question that I must remember to ask when I go for my rescheduled eye exam next Tuesday.  </p><p> </p><p>I know that like me you always wanted to wear glasses full time but I wonder do you ever have any moments of regret about your decision to go full time early on and wonder what might have happened if you hadn't? Anyway I hope you and Gemma enjoy your glasses shopping and that you each find a pair that makes you think the other looks even lovelier than before!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2016, 10:05</p><p>Nice to hear back regarding your visit Carrie, what a wonderful pair you two must look like, and I look forward to hearing which pairs you pick. As Soundman said, you can get some bargains online with Zenni or Glassesshop, goggles4u etc compared to the high street. </p><p> </p><p>With regard to lens thickness, I'm pretty sure that neither of you will need it, depending on which frame you go for, as a plastic frame will conceal the lens for both of your prescriptions, with yours being thicker at the opposite end of the frame compared with Gemma. </p><p>If you opt for a metal frame there may be 1 or 2 mm protuding  -if that - but I doubt it. I've normally worked on the perameters that each diopter (e.g. -1 or +1) equals 1mm of lens thickness, so your lenses will only be approx 3mm thick at the most and barely visible, not only will they be more expensive, but I've also found - as I'm sure many other people have on here - that high index lenses aren't as good visually compared with normal index lenses and ones vision isn't as clear with higher index lenses.  </p><p> </p><p>Let us know which ones you pick, and if you want to post a photo of them I'm sure we'd like to see them, with your new lenses in, or just library images.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2016, 09:27</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I'm not at all surprised that you both needed increases. But I expected that Gemma would need a bit more of an increase since she seemed to notice her glasses weren't quite strong enough anymore. You still seemed to be okay with your own glasses even though you were able to see pretty well with your cousin's glasses. It was very understandable that her glasses were comfortable to your eyes because nearly everyone enjoys a slight over correction. And you may remember that at the time she gave them to you you also tried on her new glasses which were I think +1.00 stronger than your current glasses and they were a little too strong for your eyes at the time. Now as it turns out when you get your new glasses they are only going to be about +.25 weaker than your cousin's current glasses. So aside from your need for astigmatism correction her current glasses should almost be perfect for you. Are you surprised that your eyes have changed so much from when you first started wearing glasses? I doubt you ever thought you would ever be talking about getting your lenses thinned out.  </p><p>Many of the4 online places are a good deal cheaper for high index lenses that they are at your local optical shops. For example i know Zenni has several different options for thinner lenses the first being an additional $19.00 and the even thinner option is $34.00 extra. they also have one that is still thinner but you or Gemma don't need that one. Actually I think you both would be okay with the $19.00 option for your glasses. None of your current glasses will be much use to you once you get your new glasses. Only your cousin's glasses might get you by in an emergency but i'm sure you would soon miss her glasses not having your astigmatism correction in them. Gemma should be able to get by with only buying one new pair since she should be okay with her current glasses as a backup.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;10 Oct 2016, 10:18</p><p>We both got new prescriptions on Saturday but neither of us could decide on new frames so going to do a bit of browsing online and also another look in a couple of opticians shops next weekend. </p><p>Gemma's prescription went up by -0.50 to L-4.75 and R-5.25. She was a little bit down that her prescription has increased but pleased it was only by -0.50 this time. Mine also went up by +0.75 in both eyes and another -0.25 astigmatism correction in both eyes. My prescription is now L+3.25 and R+3.75 and -0.50 L&amp;R; for astigmatism. I was bit surprised by the amount the + has increased. I'm not that bothered that my prescription has gone up. I'd have been perfectly happy if it remained the same. </p><p>Whatever frames we choose we will certainly ask for thinner lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2016, 11:58</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Well it isn't a bad idea to get your eyes checked even if it has only been a year since you had your last eye exam. In fact i'm a little surprised that they don't want both of you to come in yearly anyway. For the most part I think most doctors suggest getting your eyes examined every 2 years if you have perfect vision, but yearly once you start wearing glasses. At least during the years where your eyesight is prone to changing. This is just a guess but I think since you are able to see so good with your cousin's glasses but only seem to miss the astigmatism correction. You will almost certainly get at least that much of an increase. It will be interesting to see what they prescribe this time for the astigmatisms&gt; That could increase slightly, stay the same or even not show up this time since it was only -.25 in the first place. But whatever it makes a great excuse to get new glasses. You can ask, but unless you more of an increase than I think you should still be able to wear your cousin's glasses as often as you wish if you don't want to spend the money on 2 new pairs. And sorry to tell Gemma that if she even slightly feels like she might need an increase then she almost certain she does. Gemma has been wearing glasses long enough now that i'm sure she is able to tell when things just aren't quite as clear with her glasses as they used to be. Not sure about Gemma, but I know you enjoy glasses shopping, just not the price. Have fun!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2016, 04:24</p><p>We are off in to town shortly as we are both getting our eyes tested at the same place. Gemma first, then me. I am not due for an eye test until next year but it was Gemma who suggested I go this year because I can see so well with my cousin's previous glasses that are exactly +0.50 stronger than my current prescription. Gemma is going because it's 2 years since her last eye test. She's hoping that she doesn't need another increase but has a feeling she does. She can still see fine with her current glasses but says things are not quite as sharp as she remembers. She wants to get new frames whether or not she needs a new prescription. </p><p>I shall also look for new frames even if my prescription doesn't change. </p><p>So an afternoon of glasses shopping with my beautiful girlfriend lies ahead.&#128522;</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2016, 09:01</p><p>Caroline </p><p>I am not at all surprised that you already have a backup pair. You seem to not enjoy wearing your glasses but also shopping for new glasses as well. Their is no doubt that you have very good taste in eyewear or at least expensive glasses. Gucci is a very well known designer brand in glasses. If I recall you get your eyes examined at an eye clinic which has a number of optometrist and opticians. It makes sense that most of them would be wearing glasses because they know that tends to make patients more comfortable seeing them wearing glasses. You have to feel very good getting complemented on your choice of glasses from them. Very happy to hear that with your glasses on now your not having any double vision problems. Is this even the case when your eyes get over tired? I seemed to recall that one evening when you were out that even with your glasses on you had to call one of your daughters to drive you home because you were seeing double. But you had also been drinking and that might have been more the reason. Actually if you're still able to fuse things together, as you say with some effort, without your glasses that is really quite good. But i'm sure the amount of effort in doing that isn't worth it when just wearing your glasses is so much easier. Needless to say your daughters don't have the same desire to wear glasses as you did when you were their ages. In your early days of wearing glasses you really didn't need your glasses but you just enjoyed wearing them. Right now i'm sure your daughters because they are still young are able to see fine for reading without glasses but at some point they will find that their eyes will benefit from glasses and then they might appreciate some of your expensive previous glasses that you can't wear anymore. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Caroline.</b>&nbsp;06 Oct 2016, 04:23</p><p>YES Soundman, I am enjoying my second pair, the yellow Gucci ones, with gold inlay on the arms, and get some comments, mostly from the doctors, who nearly all wear glasses, so I respond  </p><p>"yours are pretty speccie too Doc!"! </p><p> so I always wear that beautiful  pair at work. Use the others as backup &amp; in the sun, as only they have photochromic lenses. </p><p> </p><p>Double vision is the norm with specs off, but I can still overcome it with effort. </p><p>Daughters are still resistant to getting specs, so I told them of the survey, showing that about 65% of men prefer their women in specs, but no response. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;03 Oct 2016, 10:23</p><p>Maria </p><p>Glad to hear that you like their music. Most of all their gits were written and sung by Michael. That would include "Minute by Minute"  "What a Fool Believes" and "Takin it to the Streets" as well as many others. I actually have the first song he ever wrote on tape and now on CD. He didn't know i had a copy until I sent it to him. It meant a lot to him because he wrote it with his dad. His dad has since passed away.  </p><p>Anyway even though it is getting closer to when you will be able to make some trips to the city you seem to have gotten much braver by quite a bit about wearing many of your glasses around your town. Now it seems you are even trying to interact with people you know with your glasses on. It wasn't that long ago that you feared even being seen wearing glasses by strangers in your area. Now i'm sure you knew that there was sure to be several people that still knew you at that supermarket if you once worked their. I have  a feeling that you were excited that a woman that you used to work with commented on seeing you wearing glasses. Even better when she complemented you on how nice you looked wearing glasses. You had the perfect reply to her that you wear glasses to drive and you just left them on to do your shopping. If those progressives only have about -1.00 in the distance part that is only very slightly stronger than your own prescribed glasses i'm guessing that you did actually wear them to drive to the supermarket. If you didn't you could have. You seemed surprised that these glasses are minus in the top and the add is a plus? That's actually the most common way for minus progressives to work. Those glasses look very nice. How well do they fit your face? As you know the better the fit the more comfortable they are. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>María</b>&nbsp;03 Oct 2016, 07:27</p><p>That's awesome, Soundmanpt!

Or maybe I'll take these: </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://imgur.com/GgCY0UC" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/GgCY0UC</a> </p><p> </p><p>I'm in love with these glasses! They are blue transparent frames by Pierre Cardin, very nice and flattering, and the prescription is great, because they are minus progresives, but the lower part is plus! The top part is around my prescription, or maybe -1, but the lower part is like +1 o +1.50. I didn't know this was possible, but I love these glasses. I have been wearing them at home for long times, and went to the supermarket wearing them a couple of times.  </p><p> </p><p>I worked in that supermarket for six months when I was 18, so I know part of the staff, including the cashier woman that works in the afternoons, so I was excited when I entered wearing the glasses. When I finished shopping she told me "I had never seen you with glasses, you look great". She wears glasses herself, for reading and such. We talked a bit about glasses, I told her I wore mine for driving but I had let them on as I only was going into the supermarket for a few minutes. She told me she doesn't see anything up close without hers, and that she liked my frame. Because there wasn't anyone in line after me, I actually offered her to try them on, and she said she'd love to! And she offered me hers to try! Which of course I did haha. Hers were rectangular red plastic frames, Gucci branded, and prescription is like +3! There weren't any mirrors around and I wanted to see myself with them, so I took my phone and took a selfie. It was so exciting! I loved the experience. I joked telling her "Well, bye" and walking to the door while wearing her glasses. After a little laugh, we switched glasses. She told me I looked good in hers, and I told her the same, as she actually looked good in mine. We joked a bit about how blind we were, and I left. It was great! As I said, I have gone there a couple other times, and she was there, but we didn't talk more about glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Oct 2016, 11:45</p><p>Caroline </p><p>It has been a while since you last commented in here. Nice to see that you are still around and checking in from time to time. Yes i'm sure with being a nurse it is critical for you to have perfect eyesight with your glasses. Misreading a number could be a serious problem as you well know. It has been several months since you got your current glasses with your first add as well as prism correction. How are your eyes doing with with seeing double? I think you were still having an issue when your eyes got tired that even with your glasses on you were seeing double. Have you managed to get a few more pairs in your current prescription? I know you enjoy having a nice selection to choose from. You already had a huge number of single vision glasses that you collected ever since you first got glasses in high school. You have 2 daughters that both actually have prescriptions the same as most of your old glasses but they both were refusing your offer of some of your very expensive glasses. Has either of them changed their mind? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Caroline</b>&nbsp;02 Oct 2016, 05:30</p><p>And to add, there are no negatives to wearing glasses, once one gets used to putting them on, they become part of your personage, and add to your visage, protect the eyes, and always improve vision,if you are over 40,as there  we are all mildly presbyopic  even if it seems perfect, it isn't till you try some glasses.  </p><p>Its hard to understand folk wanting contacts, or lasic ( unless they are top sports people) as there are such a fuss, and risky, compared with specs.. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Caroline</b>&nbsp;02 Oct 2016, 05:12</p><p>Hmm, Mr new glasses, if you see my previous posts, I was in your position, and could see OK without glasses, and I am + 1 with add another +1  for reading   ( approx.) I am 44, and it has made a big difference to my vision as a nurse, as i see so much better ( I also had a prism correction, but that is another story) </p><p>My advice, get some good quality frames, that enhance your looks and  face and wear them with pride, after a few weeks you will not go back, as the vision is so much better, and easier. If you get photochromic lenses, then sunnies are no longer needed, so save money in the long run, and look so good. </p><p>Go to it, you only live once, so see well, </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;30 Sep 2016, 17:17</p><p>New Glasses, </p><p>Your prescription is: </p><p>OD (Right Eye)  +0.25 -1.50 103  </p><p>OS (Left Eye)  +0.25 -2.00 67  </p><p>add +1.50 </p><p>The first number is your Sphere correction +0.25.  That means that you are a very tiny bit Hyperopic or farsighted.  You could probably internally correct for that, for a few more years, without much problem. </p><p>The second number(s) are your Cylinder correction and the third numbers are the Axis or angle of the Cylinder Correction.  They ALWAYS go together.  They correct for very significant Astigmatism.  Astigmatism is usually caused by uneven curvature of the front surface of your Cornea.  Astigmatism affects your vision at ALL distances and you have NO WAY to correct for it, except by wearing glasses or expensive and hard to fit, contact lenses.  It particularly affects your ability to comfortably read small text.  Your Astigmatism is the primary reason for full time wear. </p><p>The add is there to help correct for Presbyopia (literally "Old Eyes").  What that means is that your Auto-Focus mechanism is beginning to loose its ability to focus close.  Almost everyone is affected by Presbyopia in their late 30s or early 40s, but it actually can happen sooner than that or in very rare instances, later than that.  Over time, you may need more add as your Auto-Focus system looses more ability to focus, however it will probably not exceed +2.50 or +3.00 unless you need to focus very close.  The amount of add you need depends on two things, how close you need to focus and your ability to contribute some of the PLUS power. </p><p>Hope this helps a bit.  It will take about 10 days to 2 weeks for you to get really comfortable with your glasses, but my suggestion is to "bite-the-bullet" and wear them full time.  At some point, you will probably think that the glasses have made your vision worse.  This is not really true.   </p><p>Vision actually occurs in the brain.  Your eyes are merely biological cameras. What has been happening in the past is that your brain has been correcting the distorted images supplied by your eyes.  That works, IF your brain knows what something is supposed to look like, but it takes a lot of work and energy.  You glasses will correct the images delivered to your brain, but it takes a few days for your brain to learn that it does not have to correct the images and will stop doing the extra work (think of your glasses as labor saving tools).  Once your brain has learned that it now has corrected images when you wear glasses, it may complain if you don't wear them by causing headaches etc.  Don't worry that is normal. </p><p>If you have more questions, please let us know.  Millions of people have experienced exactly what you will experience and once they have grown accustomed to effortless vision, they never want to go back to NOT wearing their glasses.  Labor saving tools are pretty addictive.  If you think about it, you have probably become fond of some labor saving tools you use every day.  I have occasion to use screws in my hobby and work.  I originally scoffed at power screwdrivers, until I decided to try one.  Now, if I need a screwdriver, I reach for the power one, even to drive one screw, simply because it is easier. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2016, 13:52</p><p>I thought that was an amplifer in the background. Not sure but is it a Fender? Anyway music has always been a big part of my life. But I really never played an instrument. It goes all the way back to my high school days. My best friend and we are still very good friends decided to start a band. He played guitar and he met soem friends that one played keyboards and his little brother who at the time was still in grade school played bass guitar. Another friend happened to be a drummer. So these were the original band members. These same 4 guys stayed together for over 45 years. In fact they only disbanded abut 5 years ago. The drummer is in poor health mostly with back problems and has had several back surgeries. The other 3 didn't want to make him feel bad by finding another drummer. Those 3 still play music. One plays guitar for an Elvis Show and the other 2 play solo in small wine bars. Back in the early days they added a 5th member and over the year had several different 5th members. Sometimes it was a girl singer other times a singer guitar player. The firs of these 5th members was a young guy about 16 at the time His name is Michael McDonald he was with the band for about 2 years before leaving. He left as a good friend. A few years later he became the vocalist and keyboardist for The Doobie Brothers. You can look them up they have had quite few million seller records. Anyway back in my days with the band I was the sound engineer. That might explain the sound part of my name in here. I ran sound for my friends band for over 20 years. It bought me several new cars. We are still good friend with Michael and he is still preforming on his own. You can look him and The Doobie Brothers up on You Tube if you wish. He won a Grammy for a song called ON My Own with Patti LaBelle. So I assume you must play some guitar? Anyway it's getting closer and closer and closer for you to be able to start making some weekend trips to the city where you can feel free to wear glasses all day long without anyone knowing you. Those glasses in the picture look nice and your right about them being bold. But even so I have a feeling they might be comfortable to wear. But if you need to read anything close up you're not going to be able to see very well. And once your eyes adjust to them even taking them off probably won't help. That's why I have to think those minus progressives you bought may give you the best overall eyesight because you already know your eyes can see fine with up to -5.00 glasses for distance. And with the add you should be able to read small print perfectly as well.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2016, 09:17</p><p>Maria </p><p>So nice to see you in here again. Glad that you have not allowed yourself to run off by the nay sayers in here. I'm not sure how or why they think posting a picture is the answer anyway. Just as someone did to you all anyone would need to do is take a picture of anyone wearing glasses and claim to is them. I don't even want to talk about that nonsense. So if you're looking at mid October for things with your job to slow down enough that you can start making trips to the city and be able to wear some of your favorite glasses all day. Wearing the various glasses around your house is one thing but wearing them outside where your eyes will be seeing at much further distances is lot different as you already know. It should be interesting for you finding the glasses that are the most comfortable to wear as well as being able to see with. You already know that your eyes are fine with -3.75 glasses and they were very comfortable to wear as well. The only issue you seemed to have with those was not being able to see close up as well wearing them. For that reason you will probably find the minus progressives you got very comfortable to wear and be able to see very well at all distances. The glasses you showed in the picture look very nice. By the way you also showed a picture a while ago taken with the same background. You should continue using that as your backgroud then it's easy to know its you. Anyway if they are you think they might be around +3.00 i'm sure they do make your eyes look nice and big. They also probably make reading much easier as well, but probably not so good for distance. Everything has to be extremely blurry when you look into the distance with them on?      </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>María</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2016, 06:36</p><p>Well, obviously, the photo below isn't me, because as I said, I'm not posting any pictures of myself, and I have even less intention after how I have been treated by some annoying and disrespectful individuals in here. Yes, start the barrage of "no picture equals fake", I don't care. I you are goint to tell me that, first post a photo of yourself and show us the way. If not, your point isn't valid. </p><p> </p><p>Also, It would be bad if I was the girl in the photo? I mean, you post that link as it was a bad thing or an insult. How does a person like you, the moral guide of us all, the righteous hammer of truth, the knight of justice, do something like that? Maybe you are a superficial and misogynistic asshole? Could that be? Keep asking me to post photos and accusing me of being a fake, and I'll keep telling you to go fuck yourself. Idiot. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p> </p><p>I have checked, and I can have some of my frames reglassed with anti reflection and such, for around 30. I like some of the frames a lot, so I'm thinking about doing it to a couple of them. Is not that costly.  </p><p> </p><p>I have still one month of hard work coming, but mid-october I'll be able to make one of my trips. I haven't decided which glasses I'll use, but I'm pretty sure that I'll carry several pairs. I guess the minus progresives will be one.  </p><p> </p><p>Here's another of my new pairs. </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://imgur.com/mCA0JOv" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/mCA0JOv</a> </p><p> </p><p>The girl didn't know the prescription, but I'm guessing +3, as they are a bit stronger than my +2 zennis.

Nice glasses, in all. </p><p> </p><p>More to come soon!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maria</b>&nbsp;19 Sep 2016, 22:37</p><p>For those people here that have been asking me to post a photo,here I am posing in my newest pair of glasses that arrived today. </p><p><a href="http://www.instagram.com/p/BKkKXD8hsvQ/?tagged=glasses&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">http://www.instagram.com/p/BKkKXD8hsvQ/?tagged=glasses&amp;hl;=en</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2016, 08:56</p><p>Maria </p><p>I think most people can tell the real posts from you and the ones that someone is using your name in. Getting those boxes was a good idea since you're getting so many pairs of glasses and i'm sure there are many that you're unable to wear or just don't want to wear. Even the ones that you like the frames but the lenses are wrong for your eyes having lenses made in a more desirable prescription will be quite costly I think. Besides you already must have a good number of glasses that you're able to wear that look good on you as well. Just finding the time and opportunity to wear them is hard enough. But it seems as though you're getting more daring about being seen wearing glasses in public. That was why I asked you if you left your readers on intentionally when the post lady came to your door. I thought that maybe you were so interested in whatever you were maybe reading and your glasses were so comfortable that you forgot you were even wearing them. But even better you realized yu had glasses on but were daring enough to keep them on when you answered the door. As were getting closer and closer to the end of the growing season and the lawn care business should be slowing down it may not be too long before you can be making trips to the city where i'm sure you're far more comfortable wearing glasses where no one knows you. So have you decided which glasses you plan on wearing for the day? Do you plan to bring several pairs and switch to a different pair after a while? But until you're able to get away for a day trip I have a feeling you're going to be wearing glasses more and more out in public. </p><p></p><hr>

Then, the rest of us maybe will do the same. Now, please go to hell, thanks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p> </p><p>My last post was the one you answered, the next ones are fakes. Yes my collection is getting huge! I still have them in a cardboard box in my closet, but I'm thinking about buying a couple of expositor boxes to keep them tidy, like these: </p><p> </p><p>https://www.amazon.es/Amzdeal-Organizador-exposici%C3%B3n-sunglass-Almacenamiento/dp/B016BN5OA0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid;=1473878504&amp;sr;=8-1 </p><p> </p><p>The glasses that I can't wear for long periods, I'm still keeping them. Maybe a couple of frames that I like a lot, I'll get them filled with a bearable prescription. But some I like to wear them for some minutes, look me at the mirror and such. </p><p> </p><p>When I was wearing the Max Mara glasses in front of the post woman, it was intentional. I mean, I was reading with them on, and the doorbell rang. I decided to keep them on, and so I did. I was nervous, but I liked it. </p><p> </p><p>The minus progressives are these: </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://imgur.com/FvOgs7I" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/FvOgs7I</a> </p><p> </p><p>I like them, they're a very classic style, very light and fit very well. And they're so comfortable on my eyes! The woman that sold them to me didn't know the prescription, but I estimate around -2.50, and -1 in the reading part. I have worn them a lot around the house, and a few times on the street. I came across a few people while wearing them, but mostly tourists, and nobody said anything to me, except for a couple of "Hello!" from some townfolks. I still get sooo nervous when I go out with the glasses, but I get very excited every time. I will wear them more for sure.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2016, 10:55</p><p>Maria </p><p>You might be very busy at your job but it doesn't seem to have slowed you down with buying used glasses? I am shocked at the pile of glasses that you must have recently purchased and to hear that you have seven more coming in the mail. You have to running out of room to store them all? I love that you keep your favorite glasses that you like to wear in a drawer next to your bed. But once you find that many of the ones you have bought your unable to wear for one reason or another what do you intend to do with those glasses? If your unable to wear them they can't be much fun to just look at. Maybe you need to start a box of the glasses you like the least. Anyway the Max Mara glasses look nice. I'm guessing they were probably expensive glasses judging by how well they are made. Actually I think they might even be weaker than +1.00 based on the lens thickness. Remember if you get readers made at an opticians you can get even weaker than +1.00. After a long day at work i'm sure wearing these glasses in the evening while reading is very relaxing to your eyes. Since they are as weak you should even be able to see pretty well in the distance with them as well. So when you went to the door wearing these glasses did you do it on purpose or did you forget you had them on when the mail lady came by. You do seem to be getting more and more brave about wearing glasses in front of people. Anyway I look forward to updates about each of your new glasses and I really want to hear about the myopic progressives you got? Were they too strong was there something wrong with them that is preventing you from wearing them? I was sure you would find that type of progressives almost perfect for you to wear since you enjoy wearing strong glasses for distance and also enjoy plus glasses. Progressives with and add should allow you to see very well for distances and with an add be able to read with them as well.  </p><p></p><hr>

Think of glasses as labor saving tools.  Once your brain discovered that your glasses reduces its workload, it soon decides that it likes it when you wear your glasses. </p><p>Many people who are Myopic think that glasses made their vision worse.

If you are concerned about what your friends or family will say about your wearing glasses, they will probably be relieved that you got them.

<p><b>uhohfulltime</b>&nbsp;02 Sep 2016, 22:16</p><p>So last week I got my first pair of eyeglasses with a prescription of -3.5 for both eyes.  These were my first pair of glasses ever so I didn't know what to expect,, but when I put them on, I literally could see soooo many details that I didn't even know existed.  Like I could see colors so vibrantly and people's faces were so clear from so far (I used to not know who the person was unless I was 5 inches away from them).  Although they are great, I don't want to wear them often because I don't want to become dependent, but, sometimes I realize that I am wearing them for walking, going around the house, and just buying groceries.  I think that I have become so accustomed to clear vision that I feel like I can't function without my glasses... Like yesterday, I put on my glasses on first thing and kept them on the whole day not even realizing it.  When I took them off, I couldn't see anything and even struggled to read the words on my computer screen.  Now, I feel like I cannot function without them whatsoever so I'm worried since I'm becoming so dependent on them.  I love the glasses, but I don't want to have to use them in situations I don't need them for (like grocery shopping).  Should I just give in and wear them full time or stop wearing them and return to vision before I ever got my glasses which I was able to function with previously???</p><p></p><hr>

Of course there was no real reason except few that only come in here to be disruptive and make false claims. You know i get it all the time. You just have to ignore it know that people are smart enough to know when it's you that is commenting.  </p><p>So are you still waiting for extra money so you can buy more used glasses to add to your ever expanding collection? So are you still managing to get out after work and walk around your town wearing different pairs of glasses? Are you starting to feel even braver wearing glasses in public? Really I don't think anyone if they see you wearing glasses is going to think much about it. The only reason your neighbor even commented was of the way you took your glasses off trying to hide the fact that you were wearing glasses.If you had just kept them on he may not have said anything about your glasses. You even went in to where he was working not wearing glasses and he never said a thing about your not wearing glasses. He just assumed that you had your contacts on. That is exactly what anyone else that might see you sometimes wearing glasses and sometimes not wearing glasses. They will just assume that you wear contacts and you have just started wearing glasses more often to give your eyes a break from the lenses and as you know many people do wear contacts for work and then switch to their glasses when they get home. So you would look very natural doing the same. So I guess you're still looking forward to the end of the lawn care season so you can plan a trip to the city. If you were to go tomorrow do you know which glasses you would want to wear for the day? Would you try wearing the glasses you seem to like a lot, the -5.00/-6.00 glasses, or since you already know that your eyes are very comfortable wearing the -.75 glasses which you say are very comfortable to your eyes for distance as well as seeing close? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;07 Aug 2016, 15:39</p><p>Ric and Patrick B;  thanks for sharing the interesting discussions of your myodisc glasses and how they work well for your higher prescriptions. I presume in both cases these are your true prescriptions and not a glasses over contacts scenario.  I have heard the term blended myodiscs.  Is that what you are referring to when you speak of your actual viewing lenses inside a plus or minus carrier, which I presume is a holding area between the viewing lense and the frame. If either or both or of you were willing and to share pics of of your glasses, I am guessing other readers might find that interesting.  Are either of you of the age where you need a different prescription for close up work and if so do they make myodisc bifocals?  Thanks and regards, Greg    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ric</b>&nbsp;07 Aug 2016, 00:45</p><p>Patrick B: i ordered them in an optical store here. They dont explained me about the carrier if is negative or not. Im happy with the look appearance compared with my old pair, im triying to wear out for rest from cls. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maria</b>&nbsp;07 Aug 2016, 00:10</p><p> Here are two new pair that arrived yesterday. </p><p> The first pair are way too strong,but the second I am able to adjust too.Took a walk in them around the neighborhood just before dark. </p><p><a href="http://supermediaserver.com/glasses/" target="_blank">http://supermediaserver.com/glasses/</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2016, 15:05</p><p> </p><p>Ric -- My lenses are made of the 1.8 glass; my regular lenses in a back-up pair (non-myodisc) are the 1.9s.  The dizziness you feel when you look out the side is caused by the plus carrier which creates an extreme differential between your prescription in the myodisc bowl and the plus carrier. I never liked the plus carriers (only had one pair) which created all sorts of irritating reflections and always looked a bit weird because of the cosmetic difference between my small eyes created by the negative prescription and a highly magnified area surrounding my eyes. Remember that lenses like yours have the myodisc bowl ground into a plus blank which leaves the carrier with a substantial plus.  If the carrier is, for example, a +10 the differential between the -17 bowl and the carrier is a lot and hard for your brain to adapt to.  The advantage of the plus is that the thickness surrounding the bowl is in the center of your glasses which then tapers down to the edge of the lens for a much less thick edge appearance. In time, you will train yourself to only look through the bowl.  In the future you might want to specify the minus carrier and then have them blend the bowl into the negative carrier.  The bigger the bowl the greater the edge thickness.  I always buy my glasses from Optical4Less in Hong Kong where the prices are quite reasonable, and they will do anything you want them to do. Most labs in the States want to do the plus carriers because it's easier for them to fabricate.  Let us know how you get on.  At least your vision has been enhanced by the new prescription!   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ric</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2016, 14:42</p><p>Of course are strong prescription, but lost a lot of the ring effect. Just weight is more cause the 1.9 glass</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ric</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2016, 14:39</p><p>Well, i feel kind of dizzy by the sides, but vision is pretty much sharper than with my old glasses. Prescription changed yes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2016, 09:17</p><p> </p><p>Hi Ric -- So how do you like your new myodisc glasses?  I don't know if you have a stronger prescription, but I think I have always had better visual acuity with the myodiscs.  They've always fit better on my face are a bit closer to my eyes.  Cosmetically, they're much better and minimize the mega power rings my old ones had at the edges.  That said, they're still obviously very strong to anyone who knows what it is they're looking at.

<p><b>Specs4Me</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2016, 07:17</p><p>Vision Truth Warrior - You are absolutely wrong!  I'm a living example of not having proper eye treatment when I was a toddler.  The result is that I have amblyopia.  In case you are not aware of what amblyopia is, let me explain.  Because of it I only use one eye; thus, I don't see 3-dimensional objects properly, I've learned to compensate to some degree as the mind is capable of doing, but the truth is that I don't see them properly and have to make the effort to see what I can.  The other major problem is that I don't have any depth perception.  I again have developed some compensatory methods of sort but my depth perception is horrible.  As a result, I often knock things over when I reach for something, as a kid I was not capable of playing baseball, soccer, tennis, volleyball or anything else that required the ability to see where an object was in space.  I was teased unmercifully by other kids which caused me to grow up with little or no self-esteem.  And there is more. </p><p> </p><p>I know that there are those that believe that placing glasses on young children is condemning them to a life of poor eye-sight; however, that is not really the case.  There are many more experts that disagree with that theory. </p><p> </p><p>So, you may want to rethink your comments unless your objective is to cause young children to struggle with vision problems their whole life. Wearing glasses is not that horrible a situation, I wish I could be prescribed a pair of glasses that would correct my vision problem, it is not possible an as a result I have struggled with my vision issues for over 70 years.</p><p></p><hr>

Anyway thanks for the update, sorry to hear you're still having issues with your glasses. I was hoping that maybe as you adjusted to them those issues would go away or be lessened. Going back to where you got your glasses and having them check the prescription was a good place to start and since they checked that against the prescription you were given and everything matches then the next step is getting the doctor to re examine your eyes. He /she may decide to weaken your prescription slightly so your eyes can adjust better and then change your glasses in 6 months or so to the stronger prescription. Did the place where you got your glasses give you any reason or solution about the brightness issue you were having? Good luck tomorrow and please let us know what they find.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2016, 17:09</p><p>Soundmanpt:  You seem to know quite a bit about the manufacture of glasses.  Are or were you an optician at one point?  I sell glasses on ebay.  I buy them at yard sales and flea markets.  They always have lenses in them.  Is it necessary to sell them with the lenses?  Do opticians need them to act as templates to craft new lenses or do they have basically every conceivable lens shape in stock?  Will optical online stores craft glasses if you supply the frame?  The frames online are so cheap to buy, but sometimes I found a truly unique vintage frame  would like to have them made into glasses without buying the frame from the online optical place.

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2016, 09:47</p><p> </p><p>Hi Ric -- I got my first myodiscs when I was around -22 and wished I had got them earlier.  Super high index lenses weren't available back then so my lenses were really thick and very biconcave.  The myodiscs allowed for a more conventional frame, and when the blending option became available, I jumped at it.  My lenses today really don't look that cosmetically different from regular lenses.  I always get the negative carriers which I think are better cosmetically and don't throw off weird distortions because of the disparity in power between the myodisc "bowl" and the plus carriers.  Let us know how you get on with them.  I think you're going to like them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2016, 09:22</p><p>Maria </p><p>As soon as I saw the post your referring to of those strong glasses I didn't think it was you that posted it. Not only are they extremely strong but they appear to even have prisms which is one thing you need to stay away from. I didn't notice that the picture that High Myopic posted was a picture of one of the glasses you posted because whenever I see anything posted by High Myopic I, like many others ignore it. He comes on all the time claiming to be looking for -40.00 glasses and he/she would be asking people to send him their old glasses. </p><p>So funny girl you do have them somewhat separated if you have have 4 of your favorite pairs in the nightstand drawer. I would think you might keep several pairs of glasses with plus lenses so you can put a pair on when your in bed reading. So of course the 4 in that drawer must be the ones you enjoy wearing the most? So which ones are they? Are you still wearing your progressives that you seemed to really like around the house quite a bit or do you have a new favorite pair you wear for reading? Glad to hear your getting more brave with walking around your town wearing glasses. Honestly with so many people now wearing glasses, people seeing you wearing glasses will just assume that your now starting to wear glasses more. The some may think like your neighbor that you probably wear contacts as well and that is why your not seen wearing glasses all the time. Anyway the glasses you chose to wear for your walk you must really like how you look wearing them, and they do look nice in the picture, because the distance prescription isn't a problem for your eyes since you have already wore much stronger glasses and was able to see fine. But i'm surprised that your eyes and you were able to tolerate the astigmatism correction so well with out even getting at least a slight headache from them. Many people that actually need a very small astigmatism correction of -.25 or -.50 actually have a difficult time adjusting to it in their glasses. They often feel like the floor is slanted, a bit dizzy and like they might even throw up. When you showed me that prescription slip I even said to myself that "she's not going to be able to wear those glasses" but it seems you have proven me wrong on that one. I see that your planning on buying another pair of plus glasses. Silhouette glasses are really great glasses and usually expensive as well. I still hope you find a nice pair of progressives with minus in the distance segment. If you ever find a pair I think they will be your all time favorite pair of glasses to wear. Something like -3.75 for distance and a nice little add would put you in heaven I think. Yeah remember you called that one pair of glasses "funny looking". I think your right seeing that shape just sitting on a table may not do justice to the glasses like they might look on someone wearing them. Apparently that's the case since you seem to like how they look on you. It seems like they don't have an AR coating on them which you've come to like on your own glasses and miss it when other glasses don't have it. The -5.00 Ray-Bans should be to your liking. You like your glasses to look strong and -5.00 is certainly pretty strong and being in a bigger style frame the lenses should even look stronger. These glasses may make it into your nightstand drawer very quickly. The good news is that the lawn care season is getting closer to the end. So i'm sure your looking forward to some nice trips to the city wear you can wear a pair of nice strong glasses all day long. But until then isn't there a park or lake that you can walk to just to get away from where people are that you can wear glasses without being noticed? But i really think you just need to stop worrying about being caught anyway.  </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>María</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2016, 07:42</p><p>That "Maria 29 Jul 2016, 21:38" post isn't from me. And the "High Myopic 29 Jul 2016, 21:42" post is using one of my photos. And this isn't the first time. I don't know what the person that is doing this wants to achieve with such a childish behaviour. So please stop this pointless stupidity, thank you. </p><p> </p><p>Soundmanpt, there's no need to separate the glasses, I like to see my entire collection together haha. Also, the four pairs I like the most, I have them in my nightstand drawer for quick access haha. The ones with the prescription slip I actually like them a lot, and yesterdey I went for a walk with them. Everything was a little distorted, like if I was shorter than I really am, but I didn't get a headache. I liked it. About the "funny" frame, I actually like it, maybe the photo doesn't make them justice, but it is a modern and nice frame. The thing is that they cast lots of reflections, but apart from that, I like them a lot. So out of these seven, I'll probably wear all of them several times, except for the plus and minus one, and maybe the -7. </p><p> </p><p>I have been wearing the glasses around town sometimes these days, but haven't had any noticeable encounters. Now I'm eager to receive this month's paycheck to but another couple of pairs. I found a +2.50 Silhouette pair and -5 Raybans that I'd like to have.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2016, 06:57</p><p>Jamie </p><p>Just checking to see how your doing with your glasses? You were having a problem with brightness wearing them which of course would make it difficult to continue wearing them. Did you you return to where you bought them and see if they had any solutions for you? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>High Myopic</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2016, 21:42</p><p>-7 with some astigmatism. I like how the prescription looks on me, but the glasses are a bit small and I can't see as well as with my other pairs.

<p><b>Patrick B</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2016, 13:52</p><p> </p><p>Hi Ric -- I think you'll like them both cosmetically and visually.  Because they're not as thick as conventional lenses, they can be made to sit closer to your eyes which really helps when every mm is important.  My prescription varies slightly but seems to have settled around -25/-26  What's your prescription? </p><p> </p><p>Keep us posted! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ric</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2016, 23:26</p><p>Finally ordered new glasses yesterday. Will be first time with blended myodisc lenses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2016, 08:05</p><p>Maria </p><p>Nice to hear from you. Well it seems besides being busy at your job you have also been quite busy finding and buying more glasses. That box that you're keeping all your glasses in has to be getting quite large by now. You're getting a quite a few now that you're pretty much unable to wear for various reasons, do you maybe keep those in a separate box away from the glasses that you are able to wear? Maybe even keeping minus glasses in a different box than the plus glasses. This would make it much easier when you plan on wearing glasses to quickly find the glasses you want to wear. The seven new glasses you got are all very interesting and the prescriptions of the glasses range from weak to strong and plus and minus. Out of the seven based on you comments about half of them you don't seem to be planning on wearing. The pair that you also have the prescription slip on the SPH isn't too strong but the CYL is more than enough to be uncomfortable for your eyes. I'm pretty sure if tried wearing them you would soon get a headache from them. It seems like your limit for wearing strong glasses comfortably is probably around -6.00 and even that is pushing pushing your limits slightly. And the glasses that you were mislead on that you though were -1.50/ -1.00 turned out to be a plus minus lens combination which makes sense that you got an instant headache from them. But the rest all seem to be wearable for you. I googled FarmaOptics and it appears that they are actually a high end version of Zenni. Honestly the glasses you yourself called the frame "funny" I have to agree with you not really something most women would want to wear. But you also don't like them much because they don't have an AR coating on the lenses. I assume that your own glasses that you wear for driving has AR coating and once your eyes get used to having that coating they aren't happy not having it. </p><p>So aside for putting on the readers when you went to the post office to collect your package of incoming glasses you haven't had much of a chance to wear any of your other glasses very much. When you get less busy with work do you plan on living dangerously by wearing a pair of your minus glasses around your town? You seem to not enjoy wearing the glasses but the risk of getting caught again. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jhonathan</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2016, 14:22</p><p>Would love to see you wearing any of these!  Please post a pic!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>María</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2016, 04:33</p><p>(Continued, as there are more than 4 links) </p><p> </p><p>The next pair is low plus. Ralph Lauren frames, +1 and +1.25.

I even wore them when I went to the post office to pick my last package, containing 3 glasses. It was exciting to put them on to read and sign the receipt. I hadn't done that in a while. </p><p> </p><p>The following three I bought them from the same girl. I was curious as they have very different prescription, but I didn't ask because I dind't want to seem strange. </p><p> </p><p>-0.25 and -1.25 RayBans. </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://imgur.com/lq9d3DP" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/lq9d3DP</a> </p><p> </p><p>-4 in both eyes from FarmaOptics.

<p><b>María</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2016, 04:33</p><p>Hi! </p><p> </p><p>Sorry about the long absence, I had loads of work this week and I was so tired when I arrived home that I haven't visited the site lately. </p><p> </p><p>Soundmanpt, since I last posted I received the pair of glasses, and I also bought and received another six haha. I haven't been able to wear them much, but I had some fun with several of the pairs. As you said, I love the -5 -6, but I still prefer my -3.75 ones, as they give me the best balance between vision at all distances and decent prescription. I feel they suit me real well too. </p><p> </p><p>About the new pairs I bought, these are them: </p><p> </p><p>First, a pair of Hugoconti glasses. They are similar to my -3.75 ones, but a bit bigger and in another colour (Tortoiseshell and red vs black and blue). </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://imgur.com/C62Yo8B" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/C62Yo8B</a> </p><p> </p><p>Saldy they have some astigmatism, so they aren't as confortable to wear as my favourite ones, besides their lower prescription. The girl also gave me a ticket with her prescription, so here it is: </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://imgur.com/IwqsZqs" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/IwqsZqs</a> </p><p> </p><p>Next, a rather strong pair. The girl said to me that her prescription was -7 with some astigmatism. I like how the prescription looks on me, but the glasses are a bit small and I can't see as well as with my other pairs. Anyways I like to wear them a bit. </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://imgur.com/pzyIpAr" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/pzyIpAr</a> </p><p> </p><p>The girl told me she had lasik a year ago and she already sold another two pairs in the same prescription that were bigger. It was a shame, I'd have liked to buy those! </p><p> </p><p>I received a pair with a surprise too. The girl said her prescription was -1.50 in one eye and -1 in the other. But when I received them I saw that, apart from having astigmatism, one eye was plus, not minus. I don't know if you can see it in this photo. </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://imgur.com/qBFZ02I" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/qBFZ02I</a> </p><p> </p><p>Anyways, when I put these on I get an insta-headache, so I guess I won't use them much haha. But I like to have a singular pair like this one.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2016, 10:55</p><p>Maria </p><p>It has been a while since we last heard from you. In fact I just checked and it was back on July 12th in fact and had purchased yet another pair of glasses that you were expecting this past week. You have been very good about posting pictures of the various glasses once you have them. but either you don't have them yet or you didn't post a picture of them.  </p><p>So in your last post you seemed like even after getting caught wearing the strongest glasses in your collection it almost seemed to make you a bit more daring about wearing glasses around your town at the risk of getting caught again. But it has to be killing you really want to be able get away where no one knows you so you can wear a pair of your strong glasses all day long without fear if being caught. I'm assuming by how much you seem to love your -5.00 /-6.00 glasss they would be your glasses of choice? I guess the good news is that fall is at least getting closer with each passing day.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2016, 08:40</p><p>Cactus Jack- You are a good explainer for sure and a lot of professional people are not. But you certainly can explain things about vision and optics in a way I could never do.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2016, 08:19</p><p>James </p><p>I in no way intended to be rude to by the use of the quotation marks around your name. I honestly had never heard that before as being considered rude. But regardless you have my apology.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2016, 06:54</p><p>Michael, </p><p>Thank you for your complement, but please do not overstate my qualifications.  I am NOT an Eye Care Professional.  My background is Electronic Engineering and Computers.  I approach most problems as an engineer trying to solve a problem using my knowledge of science and personal experience. </p><p>I am an 'Amateur' in the original French sense of one who studies a subject out of LOVE of knowledge.  Many of the scientific discoveries that are the foundation of our technology were made by 'Amateurs' like Isaac Newton, Voltaire, etc. Who have scientific principles and measurements named after them.  I am NOT in that group by any stretch of the imagination. </p><p>My deep interest in vision and optics was developed because of my own vision problems that ECPs were unable to satisfactorily explain to me.  Over the years I have done a lot of Industrial training and teaching.  I have gained a reputation of being a pretty good 'explainer'.  I try to create UNDERSTANDING rather then just training someone to be a 'Parrot', who just regurgitates something they have heard without fulling understanding what they are talking about,or it fits the situation. </p><p>We do have some ECPs who occasionally post here.  I encourage them to please feel free to offer suggestions and corrections if my offerings are not correct.  The very last thing I want to do is offer a suggestion that causes harm or delays important eye care. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2016, 05:53</p><p>Sarah W- Are you going to consider trying to wear them full time for two weeks before deciding how much or little you will wear them after that? If you do that it will help you get adjusted to them more quickly. But you can function quite well without glasses but wearing them for driving especially at night may benefit you. Also when watching sporting events and movies. But some people with low scripts prefer to wear glasses full time but how much you wind up wearing them is entirely up to you. You still may be able to pass a DMV eye exam without glasses but I would wear glasses at least for driving if I was you. Both for day and night driving. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2016, 05:37</p><p>James- Cactus Jack is our technical expert around here and I would never go against what he says because he knows so much more about vision than I can ever know but if you had photophobia wouldn't it have affected you before you got glasses? Which makes me think maybe the prescription is wrong and that is your problem.When I was growing up the eye doctor we went to always told my mother and me if you are not adjusted to your glasses in two weeks to come back for a free retest. He said it shouldn't take two weeks to get adjusted to the glasses but to give it that much time. You didn't have any problems before you got the glasses did you? Any problems driving without sunglasses or being outside in general? I am too lazy right now to go through all your posts but am I correct that the reason you went for an eye exam is you just got insurance and not that you were having any problems? </p><p> </p><p>Try not to worry because I don't think you have photophobia. I may have made a mistake to send you that link because it may have scared you more than you already are.  Did you have more of a problem with one eye or were both equally as bad as far as sensitivity to light goes? If you have photophobia and the cause is something serious I would think it would likely just affect one eye. </p><p> </p><p>I think my roommate might be the one who has photophobia because she can't tolerate any glare at all. Even if it is 100% cloudy she has to wear sunglasses. Basically she has to wear sunglasses whenever she goes outside. Never mind for driving she has to wear sunglasses even when she is a passenger in a car and it makes no difference if it is cloudy or sunny out. But she never wears sunglasses in the house but she always complains about dry eyes and does blink a lot. I guess you can't tolerate wearing your glasses for any length of time because of this problem? Am I right? What I would do is go back to your ECP now and not wait two weeks because I think something might be wrong with the glasses.This is my two cents worth and will wait for Cactus Jack and Soundmanpt to chime in again.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sarah W</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2016, 05:18</p><p>Hi all, </p><p> </p><p>To answe a question from earlier the doctor said i have 20/40 in my right eye and 20/25 in my left eye. I got my glasses but don't wear them all the time yet</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2016, 04:51</p><p>John S- I am not sure of the color of Chris' eyes but I don't think they are blue. I could have ordered a different color tint for my roommate but I don't think Zenni does more than 80%. I don't think 90% is even an option. But I guess you can do it with more expensive lenses. But Chris is very difficult if not impossible to please. But it is interesting if there is a correlation between the color of a person's eyes and their level of sensitivity to light. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John S</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 22:29</p><p>In many cases, people with Blue eyes seem to be more sensitive to light. So when I order glasses, I specify 90% Brown. I'm sure they don't always come out exactly to that, but 90% seems to work well for me. I do a lot of driving, around 55,000 miles a year. I find the Brown tint provides more contrast.  </p><p> </p><p>CR-39 lenses are pretty easy to tint to 90%, but sometimes they will start to turn Red. With Trivex, they need a tintable hard coat applied, or the tint does not stay on.  </p><p> </p><p>For transition lenses, I get Xtractive Brown. The 2 main problems with transitions lenses are, the warmer the lens, the less dark they get. And unless they are directly exposed to UV, they only turn partially dark. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 22:22</p><p>Soundmanpt-I should have known better than to order sunglasses for Chris through Zenni but I thought since it was sunglasses and she would be wearing them just mostly for driving it wouldn't be a big deal. But Chris is a person who finds fault with everything. I am surprised she hasn't found fault with her regular glasses yet that she got three months ago. It may be a miracle. But she wants no part of metal frames because she said they are poorly made and the lenses keep on popping out. So only plastic now for Chris. For her sunglasses I picked out a frame made of acetate plastic. Why did she always have problems with lenses popping out and I have worn metal frames for years and that never happened to me even once? With Chris it had to happen at least a half dozen times over a period of a few years. Frankly I don't get it. That may have something to do with Chris not only getting a plastic frame this time but a very expensive one. I think the frame cost well over 200.00 and I also believe she got the premium progressive lenses so that is why her glasses cost as much as they did. </p><p> </p><p>I wasn't there when the glasses broke but did see the broken glasses. I also don't believe everything Chris tells me. Knowing her she may have done something to the glasses to cause them to break. I tend to agree with you that even if the frame was cheaply made and of poor quality the frame wouldn't have broken this quickly. I always have joked around and said if you want something to get broken just give it to Chris. She kept on breaking the drain stoppers in our kitchen sink. After she broke three of them in less than a year I gave up on buying them and just am going without. They only cost about 5 bucks or so but keeping on buying them was stupid when all she would do is break them.I asked her each time how it broke and all she said is she didn't know and it just fell apart. But those things are made of very heavy material and just don't fall apart and I doubt they would break even if you dropped them on the floor. If you own something that you think is unbreakable just give it to Chris and I am sure she would find a way to break it. Chris is the one who washes dishes most of the time and honestly I don't know what she does to break the thing in the drain.      </p><p> </p><p>I could try to test the glasses myself but I am not used to wearing sunglasses so I wouldn't have a clue as to whether or not they are dark enough. I researched the Zenni website before ordering them and the 80% gray tint was recommended for driving so I went with that.And reading everything about James maybe having photophobia it makes me wonder if Chris has that too. She has to wear sunglasses even it is 100% cloudy out. And she cannot tolerate a dilated eye exam. She claims she could not drive home even wearing sunglasses if they put the drops in her eyes. But this last eye doctor did a dry exam because I asked Chris. But her previous eye doctor always wanted to do the dilated exam and Chris always resisted. </p><p> </p><p>I thought about ordering a pair of glasses for myself through Zenni to use the store credit but I would be hesitant to do it because the only pair I ever ordered from them broke so quickly. If the next pair broke too I would pretty much be stuck. I could order 10 more pairs of glasses and they would all be great but I don't know that. That is why I used the restaurant analogy. </p><p> </p><p>And I am pretty sure I wrote about Chris' teeth when you and I were conversing about Chris' glasses through many lengthy posts a few months back. She is a part time denture wearer because she claims she can't eat when wearing them. She said she only got dentures for cosmetic reasons. Chris is very conscious of her physical appearance so that is why she had to get glasses that cost over 800.00. And can you believe she is still talking about getting contacts next year? What a disaster that would be and Chris couldn't afford them anyway because I think it would cost her more out of pocket than it did for her glasses. </p><p> </p><p>And another Chris issue is her eyes are very dry and has to use eye drops constantly. Knowing Chris if she ever got contacts she wouldn't be able to tolerate them no matter what kind she tried and wouldn't wear them and they would be a complete waste of money She is never pleased with anything I would bet every dollar I have that is what would happen. </p><p> </p><p>And did you ever hear of a part time dentures wearer? Chris is quite a woman isn't she? Two years ago my aunt took us out to lunch for Chris' birthday and then when I talked to my aunt on the phone the next day she asked me why Chris took her teeth out and put them on the table.I said she can't eat with them and my aunt then said that makes no sense which I know is true but as to why Chris does what she does my aunt would have had to ask her. Because I have no clue why Chris does the things she does. But wouldn't it have been funny if she left her teeth on the table and later realized it and went back and found that they got thrown out?                         </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 20:45</p><p>James- For your info here are some of the causes of photophobia. </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.healthline.com/symptom/photophobia" target="_blank">http://www.healthline.com/symptom/photophobia</a> </p><p> </p><p>I don't want to scare you but some of them can be serious. It may be a good idea to go back to your ECP like Cactus Jack said and explain everything to him.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus jack</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 16:31</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p>Normally an AR coating is a good thing because it reduces reflections by encouraging the photons of light to pass through the lens surface, inhibited.  That among other things is why high quality photographic lenses have AR coatings.  Most of the coatings are atomic or molecular in size and are deposited as a metallic vapor in a vacuum chamber.  They often have a characteristic of slightly reflecting certain colors (wavelengths) of light that is unique to the composition of the coating. </p><p>I have an acquaintance who wears +5.00 glasses.  The back surface of the lens is almost flat (like the front surface of a high minus lens), which produced very annoying reflections when you talked to him.  I ordered him a pair of glasses from Zenni with the low cost AR coating and he was so delighted with them he asked me to order him two more pair as spares and a pair of sunglasses.  He as two very small children who like to grab his glasses.  He drives for a package delivery company and as you can imagine, he is in serious trouble without his glasses.  The total for the 3 pair with shipping was about US45.00.   </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 16:11</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p>*The AR coating was free the week I got my glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 15:43</p><p>Soundmanpt and James, </p><p>The condition is called Photophobia, which is extreme sensitivity to light.  Unlike other phobias, fear has noting to do with it.  I suggest doing a google search on Photophobia. </p><p>The allaboutvision.com site seems to have a pretty good explanation about the causes and treatments.  Curiously, it is usually caused by other factors than the eyes themselves. </p><p>The best thing is to try to discover the underlying cause and I suspect a good place to start is your ECP.  Photophobia can be very uncomfortable and it may be necessary to use a tint or sunglasses as a temporary aid until the underlying problem is corrected. </p><p>Vision is supposed to be sharp, effortless and comfortable.  If it is not, it should be checked out. </p><p>Typically, an A/R coating lets in (transmits) more light instead of reflecting some of it.  </p><p> I experienced something like mild Photophobia right after I had Cataract Surgery.  IOLs apparently have about 6% better light transmission than natural lenses.  It helps night vision, but makes bright sunlight a bit rough and sunglasses very desirable.  At least the pupil can contract in the bright light, but not quite enough. Imagine how much "fun" it is driving home, into an afternoon sun, after a dilated eye exam.  The super dense disposable sunglasses the ECP provides help a lot, but it still is a miserable trip. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 15:39</p><p>James </p><p>Oh i'm glad to hear that. I would think that coating would have made a bit of a difference with that brightness issue? But i'm glad you got it because once you finally are more able to wear your glasses you will find that coating a very nice option with cutting down on glare and reflections. It is really great when your driving at night and car headlights are hitting your glasses. One thing you may want to try just to see if it helps any is next time your out shopping at your local Wal-Mart or other optical store see if they have a sunglass clip that comes close to fitting over your glasses. It should at the very least work during the day when your driving or just out and about and be a good test to see if it makes the brightness go away. Probably a good investment anyway since you can't or least you shouldn't be wearing regular sunglasses anymore when you're driving. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 15:28</p><p>James </p><p>Has there been any improvement with your being able to wear your glasses for longer period of time? I kind of think that the more you wear them the more that brightness should start to go away. Even though you're having some issues with the brightness have you noticed that you're able to see things in the distance clearer and sharper with your glasses? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 15:26</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p>My glasses do have AR coating.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 15:18</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p>Makes sense. You really think I am hypersensative to light? What problems could it be a symptom of?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 15:14</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p>Over the years several people have commented about how bight everything is when they first put their glasses on. But they seem to adjust okay without much trouble. I'm not sure but I wonder if she had gotten an AR coating if that might have lessened the brightness somewhat? I know she didn't get AR because she got her glasses in an hour and unless things have changed if you get AR coating they need to send them out to be made. So since she doesn't have any coating on her lenses do you think she might benefit by taking her glasses back to where she got them and have them put a light tint on the lenses or do you think she should still be able to adjust to them as they are? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 15:06</p><p>Michael </p><p>Yeah if Chris has expensive tastes she isn't likely to be interested in anything any of less the less expensive on line stores have to offer since they aren't designers or name brands. I'm sure you probably still have the sunglasses laying around someplace. Just for fun I wish you would take them out on a sunny day and just see what you think about the darkness of them. I maybe shouldn't even say this but were you present when the sunglasses broke? She didn't seem happy about anything with the sunglasses and it makes be wonder how they broke so easily. Even the cheapest sunglasses don't usually break that easily.  </p><p>I have to admit you made a very good point about eating at a restaurant and the food wasn't very good as you say I wouldn't likely be going back their again. In fact that has happened to me in the past so you really hit a nerve with that comparison. It's just a shame to let the credit not be used. Have you considered maybe trying again only for yourself? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 14:47</p><p>James, </p><p>I think you are not used to HD vision that occurs when a person with myopia gets glasses.  It is a common occurrence, but most people think it is great. </p><p>I need to talk a little science here and I hope I don't loose you. </p><p>The retina is composed of about 120 million Rods and Cones that are similar to pixels in a digital camera.  Light is transmitted by Photons.  Light rays from an object contain a specific number of Photons depending on the intensity of the light.  If the light is NOT focused on the Retina as occurs when a person has Myopia the Photons are spread out and the do not stimulate the Rods and Cones very strongly.  This is most noticeable in low light conditions  where a person who is Myopic cannot see stars in the sky because the available light is not strong enough.  When they get glasses, the very few photons from the stars are concentrated and suddenly they can see the billions of stars that make up the Milky Way (our Galaxy) and the thousands of points of light that are our neighboring planets and distant stars. </p><p>When a person who is myopic gets glasses, it is common for there to be more contrast, brightness, and more vivid colors in the images they see.  For most people, it is a joyous experience. </p><p>If you are hypersensitive to light, you need to discuss that with your ECP.  It can be a symptom of other problems. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 11:59</p><p>Soundmanpt-Good points about the reviews. But my problem is I don't think I can order a pair of glasses from Zenni that Chris would even be a little happy with. I am stupid. I should have known that before even ordering. So a store credit would do me no good. I know I told you what her regular glasses cost. Over 800.00. She paid 250.00 with insurance covering the rest. Chris has no money but very expensive tastes. I guess she went for glasses that expensive figuring they wouldn't break like most of her previous pairs did. </p><p> </p><p>And do you think Chris' very sensitive eyes have anything to do with her saying the 80% gray isn't dark enough?She can't tolerate any glare at all.  I will never be able to get a pair of glasses for her at Zenni she will be happy with. I should have known that before ordering sunglasses. And throw in the temple breaking in less than an hour.Having that happen with the first pair of glasses I ordered from Zenni makes me very leery of the company even though many people here have had very positive experiences. Look at it another way. If you went to a restaurant for the first time and had a very bad experience you probably will not go back even though people you knew always had positive experiences.      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 10:12</p><p>Michael  </p><p>Remember the brock and mortar optical stores are scared to death of not only Zenni but all the other on line shops that sell glasses so much more inexpensive. They are losing business rapidly and they know it. So it makes sense that thye probably have people writing false comments constantly for reviews trying to discourage people from ordering glasses from them. But if you go back in her and start looking you hardly find anyone that has has been unhappy with Zenni and you know the ones in here are likely very real people that have actually got glasses from them. The ones in Yelp who knows if they ever really got glasses from them or not.  </p><p>Anyway you certainly have your right to feel the way you do and honestly I wouldn't be happy either if i got glasses from them and they broke in less than an hour. But I would be even more upset if they refused to do anything about it to try and make it right. But they have clearly indicated that they want to make things right and I really don't know what else they could do? If you sit back and do nothing but complain and watch your $22.00 go bye bye then that is on you and not them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 09:49</p><p>Soundmanpt- I agree with you that for all companies there will be some bad reviews even though the company may be reputable. But going to Yelp and looking up Zenni Optical I didn't go through every review but it seemed when skimming through them that there were almost as many bad reviews as good ones and to me that would raise a red flag.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 09:37</p><p>Soundmanpt- I think they should refund me 21.80. A store credit is not good enough for me. And as for the tint Chris said it wasn't dark enough. I am fed up with her too. I try to help her and she will find fault with everything. Ordering another pair of sunglasses would be a pain.I would be clueless as to what kind of tint to order. What is darker than 80% gray? And I would be afraid to order a different frame thinking that one would break too. At this point I don't want to order any more glasses from them because frankly I would have no clue what to order. If she wants to continue wearing the useless non prescription sunglasses she is wearing let her go ahead. I really don't care anymore. Let her do what she wants to do.Chris beats to her own drum. </p><p> </p><p>I am starting to think that my roommate is mental. Apparently the tint on the non prescription sunglasses she wears is just fine. A store credit does me no good If I order another pair of glasses they will either break, Chris will complain about them or both like this time.I would bet on it.  </p><p> </p><p>Chris is one of those people who complains about everything and when something goes wrong she will always blame somebody else. Nothing is ever Christine's fault. Like with all the pairs of glasses she broke in the past by putting them on her head, hanging from her shirt or putting them loose in her purse. She blamed the place and accepted no responsibility that the glasses broke because of the way she handled them. If you let glasses fall on the ground you increase the risk of them breaking. </p><p> </p><p>I am sure I told you before about all the glasses Chris has broken through the years.Because she had constant problems with the other place she decided this time to try a different optometrist. Her glasses haven't broken yet or she hasn't lost them in three months which may be a record for Chris because usually she can't go that long without running into a problem. I think you understand what I am dealing with. I made a mistake of offering to help her. It seems lately everything I do turns out badly.I think I am a smart guy but can't get anything to come out right. I am extremely frustrated right now.          </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 08:08</p><p>Michael </p><p>I am very sorry to hear of the problems you came across with Zenni. I know i am one that told you I highly recommend them and still do. I don't think it has anything to do with the $6.95 price. Plastic is plastic and i'm sure they don't use a better grade of plastic on the $25.00 glasses. My history goes back at least 11 years for not only myself but the people in our non profit vision group, that we have been using Zenni as our source for glasses for the people we work with and not once have we had any kind of problem with them or the glasses. You had a problem even with their customer service and aside from sometimes having to wait on hold until they can take my call the people that I have talked with have always been extremely helpful and nice. My calls have mostly been when I am asking them to add to an existing order that I may have placed the day before to save on shipping costs. The tint you ordered for the sunglasses is the same as I get for the people I place orders for and again even people that have said that they are light sensitive find that tint to great. If there willing to give you a one time store credit for full value I don't know what else you want? That seems more than fair to me. What do you think would be fair in your mind? I always look at it like this. Nobody and nothing is perfect. If they provided you a bad product and are willing to replace it with something I think that is better than ending up with nothing and simply complaining about it. By the way if you start looking at nearly every company out there in Yelp even Lenscrafter's your always going to find bad reviews. If I want to find something bad about any product i'm sure it would easy to find. Go into Yelp and look up reviews on your car and guess what i bet there are tons of bad reviews about your car but you might be totally happy with your car, Anyway you have every right to be unhappy and I would be too if my glasses arrived and broke within the hour. But I would at least give the company a chance to make it right. Now if they refused to do anything thta would be much different, but they clearly want to try and make you happy.  </p><p>Just in here since you posted your comment look at how many have said how pleased they are with Zenni. I'm sure if looked you would find tons of good reviews about Zenni.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JHON</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2016, 23:41</p><p>All my family wear glasses over the last 4 years we have bought about 20 pairs from Zenni all have been exelent incuding some at 6.99</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2016, 20:40</p><p>I should have done more research about Zenni than listen to everybody here. So it is my fault. For some reason the people who have had problems with Zenni don't post here. And I would guess there are a lot of dissatisfied customers. I just went to Yelp and there are a ton of negative reviews. I should have checked out info about their customer service which most people think is terrible. You can only get a one time store credit which I don't want or a 50% refund which doesn't do much for me either especially that you have to pay for shipping to return the glasses. So I am left with no choice than to eat the 21.80 I paid to this rip off company.Not worth it to try to return the glasses.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2016, 17:46</p><p>Another complaint is I ordered the 80% gray and they still weren't dark enough. Zenni Optical is a complete disaster. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2016, 17:38</p><p>astigmaphile- Maybe I ran into a problem because I ordered such an inexpensive frame. I don't know. But now I am out 21.80.Maybe the higher priced frames are of better quality but I can't take a chance. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2016, 17:23</p><p>Michael, </p><p> </p><p>I am sorry that you had a problem with Zenni. I have bought 4 pairs of glasses from them and had no problems. All have been lined bifocals in metal frames. The frame4s were only $10.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2016, 17:18</p><p>Thank you everybody for your great advice of ordering glasses from Zenni optical. The sunglasses I ordered were the worst glasses I ever have seen my life. The temple cracked off after my roommate wore them for an hour. These glasses were of poorer quality than the non prescription sunglasses you buy at Wal Mart, Walgreens or places like that. I probably made a big mistake of going with a 6.95 frame but I wanted to keep the costs as low as possible since I was paying for them. All I will say is never again. I guess you live and learn. I will say to everybody here  don't buy glasses from Zenni Optical. Their glasses are very cheap because the quality is very poor.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2016, 10:20</p><p>Wouldn't you think James is male?  You both have referred to him as "she"?!?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2016, 10:07</p><p>It is not the glasses that give me the burning feeling, persay. It is the light while wearing the glasses. The light burns my eyes. Without the glasses I am fine, and the light is not an issue, it is like the glasses intensify the light. It feels as though light is sharply coming at my eyes. Don't know if that makes some sort of sense to you guys.l</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2016, 09:16</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p>James is a little young to have dry eye problems, but it can happen at any age.  We don't really know much about her environment or where she lives.  It may be very dry there or she may work in a low humidity environment.  Insufficient tears can cause a "burning" sensation.  I am a lot older than she is and do have dry eye problems.   </p><p>Lots of things seem to affect tear production.  She may not be blinking enough to keep her corneas moist and her tears doing their job..  </p><p>I prefer the artificial tears with lubricant.  It is a quick try and not all that expensive.  </p><p>She really needs to go back to her ECP to get to the root of the problem. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mike</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2016, 09:10</p><p>James, I would suspect that you may need a little less sphere (the -1.25 part) than what was prescribed, mainly because you said you just passed your DMV eye test a few months ago. It is easy to keep picking the clearer, bolder, image when they are doing the 1 -2 thing and end up a 1/2 diopter stronger than what you need, However most ECP's already know what you should be and the 1 - 2 thing is just fine tuning. If it doesn't get any easier after a few days I would go back. For most, the extra correction is enjoyed, but for your first glasses this can be very hard to get used to.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2016, 08:26</p><p>Cactus Jack  </p><p>I wasn't aware that "Artificial Tears" might help. But I was thinking that if she continues to have problems adjusting to her glasses she might have to go back and have them weaken her prescription a little bit. Of course they won't charge her anything to remake her lenses, but i'm pretty sure they won't do this until she has given what they consider a good effort by wearing, or attempting, to wear them for a couple of weeks. If she goes in now don't you think that is what they will tell her to do first. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2016, 07:31</p><p>James, </p><p>I am wondering if you may be having some problems with insufficient tear production.  Artificial Tears will help. Or more likely, your Ciliary Muscles are weak and what you are experiencing is your Ciliary Muscles straining to focus close, with your glasses. </p><p>Being Myopic is like having built in reading glasses.  For their size (very tiny) your Ciliary Muscles are usually the strongest muscles in your body.  They get lots of exercise as your Auto-focus system adjusts the focus of your eyes as you look at things at different distances.  With Myopia, your Ciliary Muscles do have to work very much to focus close and like any muscle that is not used very much, they become weak. </p><p>It sometimes happens when a person has had Myopia for a long time, and I suspect you have, wearing glasses to correct your distance vision causes your Ciliary Muscles to have to go to work and perform normal focusing activity.  Because they are out of condition, they some times complain just as any other muscle that has been essentially idle complains (gets painful) when you begin an exercise program. </p><p>In some instances, it is necessary to either start with a reduced MINUS prescription or even bifocals until the Ciliary Muscles get gradually strong enough to do their job and give you comfortable vision at all distances. </p><p>You are not the first person to have this problem.  You may need to go back to your ECP and tell them the problem you are having.  They can help you better than we can. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2016, 06:47</p><p>James </p><p>There shouldn't be any reason for your glasses to feel as if they are burning your eyes? Now as I had warned you even before you got your glasses getting used to the feeling of glasses does take some getting used to at first. And some people have more trouble adjusting to an astigmatism correction than others. But the only way to get past that is by wearing them. You wore them for 3 hours before you took them off to go to work. What you should have done was give your eyes a short rest from your glasses and then put them back on again. Also did you maybe take your glasses off because your shy about being seen wearing glasses around your work colleagues? By the way what type of work do you do? Anyway just don't give up on them and try your best to wear them as much as possible and trust me it really will get easier and you should be able to wear them longer each time. If your thinking that maybe they made a mistake somehow in making your glasses i'm very certain the glasses are just fine and I can tell you if you were to go back and say you think something is wrong with your glasses they will tell you that you need to wear them for at least 2 weeks so your eyes can adjust and only after the 2 weeks if your still having problems come back and they will check everything out. What would be a perfect way to adjust is by taking a day you don't have to work and put your glasses on when you get up and go sit down put on some movies you have been wanting to see and spend the day watching movies wearing your glasses. Once you get interested in the movie I think you will quickly not even think about the fact that your wearing your glasses. Right now your thinking about it more instead of allowing your eyes to relax.  </p><p>Aside from the problem with getting used to them, do you like how you look wearing glasses? Does your boyfriend still seem excited seeing you wearing glasses and what did he say when he tried your glasses on? What did he say about your need for glasses after trying them on? Your sister helped you pick out your glasses but she only knew that you had narrowed it down to 2 that you liked. Has she seen you since you got your glasses? I'm sure she is going to want to try them on as well. I'm assuming your sister doesn't wear glasses? Now that you have glasses is she considering getting her eyes examined to see if she might need glasses too? Is she younger or older than you? Sorry for so many questions but the last one for now. What style of glasses did you get? I mean are they a full plastic frame, semi-rimless, hipster style (Ray-Ban Wayfarer) rectangle or something else. I'm sure you think there cute are you wouldn't have picked them.  </p><p>Anyway the main thing now is just don't give up on wearing them. It really will get easier for you. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;19 Jul 2016, 17:27</p><p>Carrie  </p><p>That young lady you're referring to got her glasses shortly after you got your first glasses. Actually two of your college friends got glasses about the same time. I assume when you got your glasses they both tried your glasses and msut have felt like there was enough improvement that they went and got their eyes checked and they both came away with glasses. The other young lady was much more reluctant to wear her glasses very much but her prescription was slightly stronger than yours and she slowly began to wear them more often until she went to contacts and then finally back to glasses. You never said much about the other girl which now I understand why. Makes you winder how much longer they would have gone without glasses had they not tried yours on? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anna</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 21:25</p><p>The lady at the glasses store said my doctor had written a not saying he recommends lined. So, there will be a line going through my glasses? That is weird. If bifocals are indeed not common for people my age, why do I need them? what makes someone need them? Why do I need them so early? </p><p>yes, it was maybe near the end of march that I started noticing a "ghostly" image, and by the beginning of may it would not go away, and I was getting really bad headaches, and always felt dizzy. I am trying to describe it, but it is just so weird that I don't really know how. Hope you understand what I mean. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 21:11</p><p>Anna-Were you asked if you wanted the lined bifocals or progressives? Considering your age for vanity reasons I would have though you might prefer the progressives.That way when somebody looks at your glasses they won't know they are bifocals unless you tell them.  Most people your age don't need bifocals. You may get a lot of questions when your schoolmates ask to see your glasses or maybe try them on and they see glasses with a line in them.But it was good you went for an eye exam. You clearly have major vision problems that needed to be addressed ASAP. So you just began having vision problems near the end of the school year? My guess is your vision has been deteriorating for a while but sometimes it takes a while to realize you have a problem. Is this the first eye exam you ever had? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anna</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 18:43</p><p>I ordered the glasses today, they will be lined apparently. What prompted me to go to the eye doctor was that during the end of the school year, I started noticing weird things, like I look at something, and all of a sudden it was like the image split, and one was off. I also started noticing it while reading, and it makes reading hard, and gives me a headache. In a way it felt like I was dizzy all the time. The ghosty image started becoming a permenant thing, and I was getting headaches all the time, so my mom schedualed me an appointment with an eye doctor.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 17:38</p><p>Hang in there James. Soundmanpt is giving you good advice. Things will get better.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 16:14</p><p>James </p><p>Well you're not off to a very good start are you? But in part by getting your glasses later in the day just as I was saying your eyes are already strained and a good bit just from normal daily activity. Trust me if you start your day tomorrow on a slow pace with your glasses on things will slowly start to get better than they were when you left the optical shop. The smaller thing you notice is because you're nearsighted and that will rather quickly go away. The "weird and distorted" part is because you have an astigmatism which does cause that feeling at first and it too should go away as your eyes adjust. If you see this and your still awake I suggest that if you're just sitting around turn on your TV and put your glasses on and wear them while watching TV. After just a few minutes your eyes should start to relax and I think you be seeing the TV better than you have for some time. It helps to adjust when your not thinking about having your glasses on and get interested in a TV show or movie. Just hang in there and try not to give up too quickly tomorrow. Again it may help if you just sit down and relax with your glasses on. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 15:53</p><p>I do have my glasses, but am not wearing them. I tried, but everything looked smaller, and weird/distorted. Also, the light was hurting my eyes. As I was leaving the place I got my glasses with them on I looked down, and I thought I saw a step, and almost fell going down a nonexistent step. So, I took them off, maybe I will start wearing them tomorrow in the morning with better luck.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 14:47</p><p>James </p><p>Actually by the time you're reading this you should already have your glasses. What Michael is saying about your not wanting to be doing a lot of the on and off thing with your glasses is right but since you're already past mid day with getting your glasses and your eyes are already somewhat strained even though you probably don't realize it today is the one day that is okay for you to be doing the on and off thing. You're sure to want to test your eyes both with and without your glasses. Also you know that not only your boyfriend but everyone you know is going to want to see your glasses and some, like your boyfriend, are sure to want to try them on. And you're going to have to start trying to get used to wearing your glasses which may sound easy but at first you're going to notice them quite a bit. But tomorrow is when you really want to start really letting your eyes get adjusted to seeing with glasses. The best way to do that is to make a point to put your glasses on as soon as you get up and start your day while your eyes are still fresh from sleeping and not strained. Waiting until later on will just make it that much more difficult for your eyes to adjust.  </p><p>I'm glad to hear that your boyfriend is excited that you're now going to be wearing glasses. I'm sure having his support means a lot to you. So of the 2 you were having a tough time deciding on, did you favor one more than the other and did your sister and boyfriend pick the one as the best one for you?   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 12:31</p><p>James-Are you going to try wearing them full time for two weeks to see how it works out?You made a wise decision to get the prescription filled because I think the glasses will make a difference in your vision. If I was you when you get the glasses I would put them on and keep them on for the rest of the day until you go to bed.You need to keep them on for your eyes to get used to them. The constant on and off thing is not a good idea. Because if you do that you will never get used to the glasses. Keep us informed as to how you are doing. I am sure you will look great in your glasses and will receive many compliments. I wish you the best of luck.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 12:11</p><p>Just came back from the glasses store, my glasses will be ready in about an hour. As I had said, I took my boyfriend with me, and he agreed(without knowing) with my sister on the two I could not choose one from. Michael, yes my boyfriend is actually very excited about me getting glass, seeing me in glasses, and him trying them on. If it was not for him and his support, I may not have actually filled my prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 10:50</p><p>Anna-Multi focal lenses are bifocals but my question is are you getting the ones with the line or the no line ones which are progressives? Have you ordered your glasses yet? And plus lenses are for reading but even though hyperopia affects mainly your close up vision it can affect your distance vision as well which is the case with you. But it is unusual that you are nearsighted in one eye and farsighted in the other one. And am I correct that it was never clearly stated to either you or your mother as to when you should wear your glasses? That is a pet peeve of mine that neither eye doctors or opticians seem to offer advice especially to first time glasses wearers. They definitely should. I would know because I have worn glasses for 54 years since I was 9 years old. Also curious about something else. What prompted your visit to the eye doctor? Were you having any vision problems you were aware of or was this a routine check up? The summer is a popular time for kids' eye exams so they will be all set for when they go back to school in the fall.         </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anna</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 08:29</p><p>Crystal Veil </p><p>Thank you for sharing. </p><p>Michael </p><p>On the lines below the chart with my prescription it says bifocal, so I assume that means bifocals. </p><p>General questions </p><p>Aren't + glasses for reading? How will I see far with that eye? Or for that matter, how will I see close with the other? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 05:36</p><p>Anna-Here is an explanation of myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism.  </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.eugeneeyecare.com/conditions/What_is_Nearsightedness,_Farsightedness,_and_AstigmatismQQ.html" target="_blank">http://www.eugeneeyecare.com/conditions/What_is_Nearsightedness,_Farsightedness,_and_AstigmatismQQ.html</a> </p><p> </p><p>And an explanation for prism. </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.ehow.com/how-does_5183223_do-eyeglass-prism-lenses-work_.html" target="_blank">http://www.ehow.com/how-does_5183223_do-eyeglass-prism-lenses-work_.html</a> </p><p> </p><p>Each eye is individual and it is normal for the prescriptions in each one to be at least slightly different but it is rare but not impossible to have one myopic eye and one hyperopic like you have. And glad that they double checked the script to make sure it was correct.Have no clue what opeia is. You may have heard the word wrong. Also not sure why the reading add is different for each eye. Also don't know if one eye being farsighted and the other one nearsighted has anything to do with you needing prism in your glasses. I will let the experts here try to answer that. Yes you have a very complex prescription and will require multi focal lenses.Are you going to get standard bifocals or progressives? And absolutely you will need to wear your glasses full time. It appears that your doctor didn't make that 100% clear to your mother.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 02:49</p><p>Anna, </p><p> </p><p>a difference of 2.75 between both eyes, with one eye minus and the other eye + is fairly rare. I have the same problem but in my case the difference is 3.75. The image seen through the + lens is a bit larger than the image seen through the minus lens. It takes a bit of getting used to, especially in case you chose a large frame. It's my experience that the prescription in minus lens should be knife sharp and the prescription in the + lens just a touch (+0.25 or +0.50) above the optimum, creating a bit of soft focus. This creates a better balance between both images. Opticians always go along with my preference but it may take a bit of explaining. As your difference is less than mine, you may not have the balance problem. I hope that your optician has taken the balance issue into account when giving you the prescription. If the balance does not feel right, you can always go back to the optician and ask for a slight change in the prescription. Good luck!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anna</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2016, 22:04</p><p>Also, is it a bad thing that my eyes are not the same? Is that a normal thing that happens? Why/how does it happen.  </p><p>Thank you to all that reply and try to help me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Anna</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2016, 21:58</p><p>Just to clarify because there seems to be confusion, the numbers in the first row are: -1.25 and 2 BO for Sph and prism, respectivly. The second rows numbers are +1.50 and 2 BO, in Sph and prism, respectivly. The third row and fourth row are +0.75 and +0.50, respectivly. The prescription was typed twice, and written once. I actually rememeber the front desk girl asking the doctor if she had the right prescription, and he double checked and said yes, she has one "-" and one "+." The doctor was talking to my mom and I think I heard something about focals and different add (you guys have mentioned that too). I also kept hearing opeia.  </p><p>To answer KL's questions: No typo, there is one number with a minus in the first column, and the other three are +. Also, I am 15, but almost 16.  </p><p>To answer Plus Tony's question: yes, as I have typed there are pluses next to the 1.50, 0 75 and 0.50 and minus next to 1.25. </p><p>My main issue is even after reading a little about glasses prescriptions I am confused on what my vision issue is. I would appreciate if someone would explain it to me. Also, based on reading older posts on here, I wonder when and how much I should wear my glasses when I get them. All my doctorsaid was to my mom was that wearing glasses should help Anna see normally.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2016, 14:48</p><p>Soundmanpt- I also suggested Zenni to James as a place she could buy a spare pair of glasses and/or sunglasses. And I am sure her boyfriend will be pleased with whatever frames James and her sister pick out. It seems as though James' boyfriend is excited that she is getting glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2016, 14:14</p><p>James </p><p>Generally boyfriends have proven not be of much help with things like that. If you think about it do you usually ask him to help you pick out a dress or shoes? I understand why you want him to help because if you do decide to wear your glasses often or full time he is the one that will be seeing you wearing them the most. But maybe first show him what you and your sister found.  </p><p>Since you're using your insurance to pay for your glasses which of course is the right thing to do being able to get them the same day is nice. It sounds as if you are getting your glasses from Lenscrafter's since as for as I know they are the only place you can get your glasses the same day. Getting your glasses the same day means that you won't be getting an AR coating (anti-reflective) on your lenses which is extremely nice to have, but it is an option that insurance companies don't pay for and if you did pay the extra cost of about $75.00 out of pocket they have to send your glasses out to be made which means you wouldn't get your glasses for several days. But once you see how much you're going to be wearing glasses you may want to consider taking a nice look at "zennioptical.com" to see about getting a pair of prescription sunglasses which would be nice to have when you're driving on a sunny day and another pair of glasses so you have 2 pairs to choose from as well as getting them with the AR coating. You can get really nice good quality glasses in your prescription for under $13.00 and they only charge $5.00 for the optional AR coating. So the total cost of your glasses would only be $18.00. So by sometime tomorrow you should have your glasses and be wearing them. I'm sure you will be giving an update later tomorrow after you get your glasses. I look forward to hearing what your reaction will be. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2016, 14:04</p><p>James-Very good. Once you get your glasses please keep us updated. I would strongly urge wearing them full time for at least two weeks. That will give you time to get used to them. Then after that you can decide whether or not you want to continue wearing them full time.But I am sure you will look great in glasses. Once you get them I bet you will get a lot of compliments.And you may be pleasantly surprised by how well you see when wearing them. Your prescription although not strong is enough to make a difference I would think.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2016, 13:43</p><p>My sister and I were just looking, I did not actually get glasses yet. We were hung up on two pairs. I want to take my boyfriend with me tomorrow, and then I will get my prescription filled. The place only takes about an hour to make the glasses, so they will be ready tomorrow.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2016, 12:58</p><p>Plus Tony-I couldn't agree with you more about doctors not offering advice.It is the same here in the United States. My roommate Chris got her first pair of bifocals about six years ago. Before that she was wearing over the counter readers for at least several years.
