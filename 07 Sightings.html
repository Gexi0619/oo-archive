Really made my day. A precursor to my first adenture into specs, 6 months later. </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://graciousladiesbehindcrystalveil.blogspot.com/2018/07/whitney-117_93.html" target="_blank">http://graciousladiesbehindcrystalveil.blogspot.com/2018/07/whitney-117_93.html</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2018, 07:17</p><p>It's still a free country so you have your right to believe whatever you to believe. So if you don't want to believe me when I say that I have ONLY ever posted in this site as "Soundmanpt" that's your problem and not mine.  </p><p>I have no interest in anyone that wishes to hide under the veil of commenting without any name or title at all. Those people are truly like snakes hiding in the grass to me. What you think matters little to me. The main thing is that those people that i'm accused of being know that i'm not them. So since I know that bi'm not them I have no reason not to believe they aren't who they say they are either. Like you, that's my option. Have a nice life. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2018, 04:10</p><p>The last poster forgot to mention all the Wild Web Wankers. Scanning everybodys personal information from all over the Internet in Facebook and instagram for hours and hours and hours every day and secretly re-posting private citizens pictures here without their permission so everyone can secretly whack off to them.   What horrid creeps.   Can anything be more sexually perverted than that?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2018, 03:33</p><p>Thats the problem, mirky. Everyone wants to indulge their fantasies by making up fake characters or making up fake stories. No one tells the truth here anymore. LikeLensees is more concerned with posting racist and sexist comments. Soundmoon has some stupid dual personality thing going and keeps posting and then posting about how he hasnt posted before.  AMHG is  greedy idiot who keeps trying to make money off the innocent people here by posting his ads everywhere he can.   Add to that, all of the regular anonymous trolls here, and it is clear that eyescene has long outlived its usefulness. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie </b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2018, 11:32</p><p>We were hanging around with some friends last weekend when another friend turned up wearing glasses. After being bombarded with questions, compliments and requests to try them on from the group of friends it was established that they were her first glasses and she had just picked them up. She has astigmatism and slight shortsightedness. Apparently her optician was surprised she hadn't got her eyes tested sooner and strongly recommend wearing her glasses full-time. She said everything does look clearer but she feels a bit dizzy (not helped by the shock of being told she should wear glasses full-time!). She said the optician reassured her that the dizziness will soon go. She also got prescription sunglasses which I imagine she used quite a bit this past week as it has been yet another hot and sunny week in this part of England (although we have had our first rain in several weeks today). </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;17 Jul 2018, 15:50</p><p>I have enjoyed reading and posting on this website, and its predecessor, for about 20 years now. Never have I seen such pityful bashing and fighting as in this thread recently... Let us please not dstroy this site. I truly hope I can continue to view pics, read stories (true or made up), and enjoy videos here for many more years! This website is too good for specs lovers, let the dream continue.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Moonshiner</b>&nbsp;16 Jul 2018, 23:29</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p>You must cease, and desist immediately regarding any false posts. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Jul 2018, 09:47</p><p>Obviously someone is trying to make things confusing here.  15 Jul 2018, 23:50 is clearly not from me, nor is the last post.  I think people who know me here understand I would not go into a profanity laced personal tirade against someone whom I don't even know.  As I said before, it doesn't bother me and I can do this all day.  Keep it coming.  I am retired so this makes my days more exciting.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2018, 23:50</p><p>First of all, you clearly can't read can you? All that I have sid is that I have never used any  other name in this forum which is the truth. I'm sure that i'm not the only one that has used a different name in a different forum. What are you the computer police? I see nothing wrong with using a different name in a different forum. Hell you're using everyone's name except your own in here. So before you worry about my doorstep maybe you should clean your own first. Why do you such interest in me anyway. I certainly have no interest in you. If you think all your harassing is going to make me go away you're wasting your time. I'm going nowhere! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glass Lenses</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2018, 21:45</p><p>Likelenses </p><p>Yes, I also feel that he is a vile homosexual with anger issues, based on his posts. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2018, 18:26</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p> Yeah, this is the same FAGGOT that has been trolling me, and using my username with some of his posts. </p><p> He has been around for quite some time, but has become more active lately.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2018, 16:41</p><p>@Soundmanpt.  In other words, you just admitted to posting under false names.  Something you swore you have never ever done.  Such a bullshitter.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2018, 16:25</p><p>To Busted </p><p>It's nice that you have dedicated your life to pestering me for some strange reason. I will repeat again what I have been saying for some time now which you simply don't care to believe. I HAVE NEVER POSTED UNDER IN OTHER NAME IN HER OTHER THAN SOUNDMANPT! I see plenty of people in here that use things other than names. Such as Glass Lenses, Slit, Oracle, Mister mild, and numerous others is it such a big deal to you that I comment under the name of "Soundmanpt"? You either use several names or none at all but apparently that's okay because it's you? You don't seem to want to post your name. So what if I am in other forums under a different name? Remember that may not be my real name either? It could be that my real name is Bob Thompson or Joe Fredrick's? Anyone should be smart enough not to ever use their real name on sites like this which i'm very sure you are more than well aware of now aren't you?  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glass Lenses</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2018, 16:21</p><p>Forgot to post it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MisterMild 15 Jul 2018, 10:46</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Souundwomanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2018, 15:00</p><p>What's the big deal if Soundmanputz wants to post under other names. </p><p>Are you really so stupid to believe that anyone that posts anything on the internet is doing so under their own name.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lurker</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2018, 14:35</p><p>Holy shit, dude, calm down a little. Not everything is some grand conspiracy. Even if Soundmanpt is posting as Jim Boice somewhere else, frankly, who really gives a damn? No one cares about your "BUSTED" Gotcha moment. </p><p> </p><p>Assuming that any large amount of people who come here are actually soundmanpt or whoever else, it's clearly not killing eyescene nearly as much as you believe. At least people were somewhat engaged with these supposedly fake people(note:it is far, far easier to come across this forum than everyone seems to think, not everyone that isn't you is fake), but all this pointless arguing has done has driven people away from any discussion.  </p><p> </p><p>Soundmanpt, and whoever else is accused of faking the posts of other people, isn't killing this forum. This kind of pointless shit and the childish way you handle it, and the people constantly intensely arguing over the poorest excuse for political shitposting I've ever seen like a bunch of children; that's what's killing this forum.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>To Busted</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2018, 13:06</p><p>Does anyone really care?  Do you not have anything better to do. Your daily attacks are childish and a waste of bandwidth. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BUSTED: Soundmanpt Fake Accts!</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2018, 11:02</p><p>In case you missed it, let's reprint that important part again on JIM BOICE aka SOUNDMANPT... </p><p> </p><p>Thirdly, you have no credibility. You posed as a retired optician, Jim Boice, on Yahoo and other sites. Yes, you do use different identities. As Jim Boice, you, in the guise of a trained optical professional do everything you can to put people in glasses who may not need them, increase the wear time, get stronger prescriptions, and purchase glasses without a valid prescription online. Zenni seems to be a favorite of his too. Seriously, what optician, retired or otherwise, would promote online competition and buying glasses without a valid prescription? Why would they promote competition that may do away with the jobs of the people that followed them into the profession. </p><p> </p><p>Jim Boice's and your posts on here could be swapped because they are identical. If anyone actually cared, they could check this out for themselves. There are hundreds of Jim Boice posts on Yahoo alone. OR..... has the account been suddenly deleted the past few days? That would be mysterious.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>BUSTED: Soundmanpt Fake Accts!</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2018, 10:58</p><p>Let's start off by saying that Soundmanpt swore to hell and the devil that he has never posted under another name.  Welllll never trust a jackoff boy.

Any of us could register for several hundred e-mail accounts and be on there as several hundred individuals. Do you really think that little of the rest of us to not realize that? </p><p> </p><p>Secondly, I am not accusing you of being Maria or Carrie. Do I believe that they are females? Not at all!!!!!! Carrie is someone who loves plus prescriptions, has a lesbian fantasy, and likes large mammillary glands. Maria is some guy who loves collecting or the thought of collecting many pairs of women's fglasses and the idea of wearing them. </p><p> </p><p>Both could prove otherwise by taking a multitude pictures with their hands holding each of their pairs of glasses in front of them from the chin on down. They could crop their face completely out of it. Maria has no problem taking pictures of a pair of glasses. She should be able to have many posted of her personally holding each pair that she purchases. Carrie should be able to post quite a few pictures too. Just crop the face out. Privacy is protected! </p><p> </p><p>Instead, we can expect indignation at the thought of this. They should be able to accomplish this in the next 24 hours otherwise. More than one picture too!! It should be so easy to do. </p><p> </p><p>Thirdly, you have no credibility. You posed as a retired optician, Jim Boice, on Yahoo and other sites. Yes, you do use different identities.

What set of ethics or moral compass?? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2018, 17:06</p><p>Ben Dover </p><p>Well you're right about one thing, i'm not Carrie. As for Carrie I try to believe people are who they say they are and I don't ever want to accuse anyone of not being who they say they are unless I see something to prove me wrong about them. What you're basing your accusation on is no more than an assumption which can't be considered as evidence either way. So is it possible that Carrie is a man and not a woman? Who knows? But I already know that there are those that think I have been pretending for years to be her and I know for a fact that is wrong so why should I believe that she isn't a woman?   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ben Dover</b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2018, 01:12</p><p>Soundmanpt truly is naive.  He has been played for years by a guy in his basement pretending to be a woman to play out his sexual fetishes for lesbians.  Anyone reading "her" text can tell it is a man.  Or it is possible he is living out gay fantasies through her.   </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I know Soundmanpt is not Carrie, but she is also not a woman either.  There are subtle psychological clues in her posts which point to her true sexuality that only someone in the field would recognize.</p><p></p><hr>

We are in fact 2 separate people living in different places with an ocean between us. Like you, I get tired of the same accusations being thrown at me about being all these people but mostly as me being you. It is frustrating to say the least when we both know how wrong this person really is.  </p><p>I consider you as a good online friend as well. We have have commenting to each other from about the day you put glasses on for the first time. Do you remember how many years ago it was when you got those first glasses? I'm thinking it was 7 or 8 years ago?  </p><p>Even though I am "straight" I have known several young ladies that were lesbians and they were good friends and it was impossible not to like them. That alone made me except them the same as I would any other young woman. I thought they were very brave to come out and be so open about their preference for a mate or partner. I feel the same way about you and Gemma. But not really knowing Gemma you seem more open and brave than she is.  </p><p>I always try my best to be helpful to everyone about things related to glasses and their eyesight.

I am living in the Midwest part of the US where I have lived my whole 69 years. And as far as I know, and I no reason not to believe her Carrie lives somewhere in the UK. If anyone wants to take the time they will see that I have been coming in here since I believe 2002 or 2003. Carrie has been a regular in here for at least 7 or 8 years and maybe even longer. She started coming in here about the same time as she got her first pair of glasses. There is no way I would ever attempt to play another person for that long. So yes I am NOT Carrie.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gettingboredofthisnow</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2018, 02:15</p><p>It is plainly evident that Soundmanpt and Carrie are different people. Just look at the syntax and writing styles of both of them. Carrie regularly employs anglicisms and cultural references that only a Brit would understand (TV shows etc). Soundmanpt (who, I believe is based in the Midwest) writes in a very different style and is very Midwest in approach (baseball, US spelling etc). Of course, there are fakes on this site. But Soundmanpt and Carrie are, in my view, legit.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pyrofan</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2018, 17:32</p><p>In Japan recently at a very popular shopping district that are always filled with Chinese tourists. The place is filled with myopes from teenagers to older middle aged women- many of them wearing very strong lenses. A lot younger crowd wore large circular metal frames which means the strength of their lenses are really emphasised. The older seems to be leaning towards either half rimless or smaller old fashioned metal frames. </p><p> </p><p>A highlight was a very pretty -10 Asian girl with thick lenses protruding off her plastic frames widening her eyes and really focusing to the distance before pointing excitedly when she found what she was looking for. Funny as without her glasses she would struggle to see her own feet.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2018, 05:20</p><p>For me, mild plus lenses are not usually interesting, especially as these days they are usually in big black plastic frames which do not, in my opinion, flatter the wearer.  However, yesterday I saw 3 different attractive ladies wearing interesting plus lenses. </p><p>The first was a pleasantly plump young lady wearing  moderately strong plus lenses in a rectangular-ish but reasonably delicate plastic frame which, though black, did not look dull.  She had a beautiful complexion. </p><p>The second was a smallish blond young lady wearing fairly small cat-eye shaped plastic frames, black at the front with side-arms gilt, rather old-fashioned looking.  Her lenses were quite strong; I could see nothing through the back of the lenses. But she seemed confident enough walking through the crowd and up the stairs as she got off the train. </p><p>The third was the most interesting of all and, unfortunately, the briefest. As I was about to board the train home, off came a young lady wearing the sort of upswept semi-rimless frames I have not seen since the early 1960s when I remember as a boy having a crush on a  teacher who, unusually for the times, had two such pairs of glasses, one red, one green, which she alternated, presumably according to her outfit of the day. Yesterday's lady's frames seemed multicoloured, predominantly blue but with some red.  She had a medium plus prescription and wore round her head a red and white-spotted scarf, knotted at the back in the style of a 1950s housewife.  I have no idea whether this is a new fashion of the day or whether she was heading for a hen weekend with a 1950s theme (in which case she must have invested quite a lot of money in the glasses).  Either way she looked gorgeous, as well as making an old man feel nostalgic. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2018, 01:52</p><p>On my walk to work I quite often see a very pretty Polish  sounding about my age (early 20s). She is short like me but slimmer. She has blonde hair that is usually tied back in a simple pony tail. We always say "Good morning" to each other as we pass. She used to sometimes wear black Wayfarer style glasses with a mild minus prescription. Over the last few weeks she has been wearing them more often than not. Then on Wednesday she was wearing similar size and colour frames that were slightly cat eye shape and the prescription looked stronger. I'm guessing her old glasses were initially for distances but her eyes got and she found she needed her glasses more then got an eye test which resulted in a stronger prescription. I think she has gone full time with the new glasses.  </p><p>Off in to town soon to meet up with Danielle and Vicky and some other friends. The coffee shop is calling!</p><p></p><hr>

Later took out a pair of + glasses and put on her nose. Her left lens was much stronger then the other (say +5 and +2 or so...). Age around 50... </p><p>Later on she had to read the menu which was printed in a very small font. Without thinking twice (it should have been very natural for her) she took off glasses and put the left lens in front of the paper using as a magnifying lens. She read then put the glasses on the table, had a glance around the room, then put the glasses on again complaining again about how poor her vision is </p><p>She was not very cute, but the poor vision and the way she was managing with her glasses both for far and close vision were so lovely...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lou</b>&nbsp;16 May 2018, 07:59</p><p>Hi Crystal Veil </p><p> </p><p>Thank you very much, but I wasn't talking about my colleague's distance vision when they looked up whilst wearing glasses for reading their music, rather expressing my surprise that they were only wearing glasses for music, when their vision at around the 5 feet mark also appeared to be blurred without glasses, the way that they were squinting to see the notice. </p><p> </p><p>As a matter of interest, what instrument do you play?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 May 2018, 07:37</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Thanks for the update on Vicky's work colleague. Since she just got her glasses and isn't wearing them very often her eyes really haven't had a chance to adjust to the prescription of her glasses yet. So it's understandable that she is still able to read her phone as well as other things without them. But she admits that it is much easier to see her phone with her glasses on. So because she can see her phone better with her glasses she will probably slowly start putting her glasses on more and more often when she needs to see her phone. It's very possible that she will soon get tired of having to put on and take off her glasses so much to see her phone. Of course that depends on much she uses her phone. Since she has no trouble seeing distances wearing them it could lead to her keeping her glasses on more and more. If you're close to being accurate about the prescription of her glasses it means that her glasses are about the same as your first glasses. Only difference between you and her is that you went to full time wear as soon as you got your glasses because you wanted to wear glasses. I wonder if Vicky will try encouraging her to wear her glasses more often. We know that Vicky has a thing for glasses on herself and I would assume for others as well. It should help that she got prescription sunglasses as well and that she plans to wear them anytime she wears sunglasses. So if she wears sunglasses very often her eyes are going to get more and more used to seeing things through her prescription lenses. So if she is a book reader and enjoys laying out on a sunny day reading for hours that may help with getting her wearing her regular glasses more as well. In a way it sounds like she might be just a little bit shy about being seen wearing glasses. what do you think?         </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;16 May 2018, 06:25</p><p>Lou, </p><p> </p><p>I am one of many musicians who prefer a bit of blur when performing on stage. No need to see the audience crystal clear. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lou</b>&nbsp;16 May 2018, 04:51</p><p>This isn't a very interesting sighting, only a confusing one, which cross references with my thread on the Hyperopia and Presybopia forum. </p><p> </p><p>I'm a musician and play in bands and orchestras.  It is pretty common place for people over 40 to be wearing glasses for the intermediate distance of reading music/changing from their distance glasses to music distance glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Let's consider my Mum for a moment, who since she doesn't use a computer/play a musical instrument, has no real need for an intermediate prescription, and wears bifocals, so that she can knit in front of the TV.  She wears her bifocals for reading, tv and driving, but not full-time.  I've tried on her glasses, and her distance prescription must be around +1.25 or +1.50, and her reading add around +2.50.  I can never understand since she wears glasses for TV, saying that she can't see people's faces without, and also for reading, how she can't find everything annoyingly blurred between TV and reading distance, which would encompass most of the activities/tasks she does in the house. </p><p> </p><p>Going back to the boring sighting.  I have a band colleague around 60 years old, who wears glasses only to read their music (quite possibly they have a stronger pair for reading).  In the break time, I saw them really squinting to read a notice around 4-5 feet away, which I could easily read, almost definitely without my admittedly small prescription glasses.  What I couldn't understand is that if music at around 3 feet away is blurred and so is even a notice around 5 feet away, wouldn't most of the contents of the room and people in it be blurred, and why would someone not be bothered by it? </p><p> </p><p>I suppose the answer is that the blur must be insignificant enough to be tolerated by that particular person when they do not specifically need to read text or see specific details, but I know without doubt that I would not want to walk around/chat to people with that level of blur. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;15 May 2018, 10:01</p><p>We saw Vicky's colleague on Saturday at the coffee shop. She showed us her glasses. She admitted that they make the text on her phone extremely clear. She pointed out that she can still read her phone (and other things) without them, it's just a bit easier with them. "Probably won't wear them much", she said. Looking at the lenses her prescription is probably about +0.75 to +1.00. She said when went to pick up her glasses she double checked that she didn't need to wear them all the time. She was told that is correct, although she can wear them as much as she likes if she wants as she has no trouble seeing distances with them. She said that was a good thing as her 2nd pair are prescription sunglasses and being able to use them as normal sunglasses and not just reading glasses for reading in sunny weather is a bonus. She has no plans on wearing the clear lens glasses any more than absolutely necessary. The frames are sort of Wayfarer style in black and the sunglasses are in a similar frame.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mike (-16)</b>&nbsp;14 May 2018, 03:14</p><p>Hello </p><p> </p><p>Just realised that my phone has auto-corrected my message.  </p><p> </p><p>The man a saw had bi-concave lenses with fresnel vertical prisms.  </p><p> </p><p>I saw him again this morning, waiting for a tube train. He was using his phone with the phone in front of his let eye. The phone was closer than the end of his short, turned up little nose.  </p><p> </p><p>After we boarded the same tube train, I noticed that his right eye was turned in an almost random direction, pointing outwards from his nose.  </p><p> </p><p>It would appear that he couldnt see the whole phone screen, as he kept moving the phone left and right when he was reading. Although, when he was typing, he coped ok; I guess the qwerty keyboard on an iPhone is easier to read than the text on the screen.  </p><p> </p><p>As I said, London is amazing. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie </b>&nbsp;06 May 2018, 03:49</p><p>Last weekend Vicky's colleague did wear the glasses just for the few minutes she was looking at her phone but not at any other time when we were in the coffee shop.  She mentioned she was getting her eyes tested the following Thursday.  </p><p>This Saturday she again wore Vicky's old glasses when looking at her phone during her break. I asked her how the eye test went. She said that unsurprisingly she does need glasses for reading. She doesn't know her prescription but does remember being told it was slightly stronger than Vicky's old glasses. (She took the glasses with her to the eye test.) </p><p>She will get her glasses in about a week and is supposed to wear them for reading and any other close up activities. She isn't very keen to wear glasses but accepts she needs them. She also said that she will only wear them when her eyes start to ache. </p><p>Danielle looked the most feminine I have seen her since I have known her. Dressed for the warm sunny weather we're getting at the moment and wearing Clubmaster style prescription sunglasses. Of course my Gemma was looking stunning. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 May 2018, 07:46</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Did you you go to the coffee shop over the weekend where Vicky works? If so, was her work colleague working and wearing Vicky's old glasses? I agree that if they benefited her with seeing her phone i'm sure they would benefit with working as well.  </p><p>Good to hear that Danielle admits that her eyes feel more comfortable now wearing glasses and that her depth perception is better as well. When she's sitting and just talking she can still take her glasses off if she chooses to. Her eyesight isn't so bad that she can't see across the table without her glasses being on. The longer she holds off getting contacts the more likely she may not get them at all. I'm a bit surprised that if she planned on getting them she didn't already get them. There's little doubt that when she doesn't have her glasses on now she really notices the imbalance between her eyes which has to bother her. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2018, 17:52</p><p>Soundmanpt- Vicky's colleague probably would benefit from wearing glasses for work and not just for looking at her phone. We are likely to visit the coffee shop this weekend and it will be interesting to see if Vicky's colleague wears Vicky's old glasses at all. </p><p>Danielle would still rather only need glasses for reading or not need them at all but she has admitted that her eyes feel really comfortable with them on and, as her optician said, her depth perception is better. She hasn't got contacts at the moment but did mention she might get some at some point. I think she's still a little shocked about the increase in prescription for her right eye. She is fully used to the new prescription now, I think. The term "grudgingly accepted" perfectly describes how Danielle has agreed with the optician's recommendation of full time wear. I'm pretty sure that over the coming weeks and months she will understand better why full time was recommended.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;25 Apr 2018, 15:09</p><p>When I played in youth soccer leagues a strap was mandatory for all glasses and if you did not have one during pregame equipment inspection you did not play.  I could not get used to the idea of heading the ball and tended to instinctively protect my face by blocking with my arms instead, which usually resulted in a foul called.   </p><p> </p><p>Needless to say I liked basketball and volleyball a lot better.  Still, I like my glasses secured.  Once I spent a week at a convention playing a bit of 3 on 3 and one of my friends wore thick minus lenses that looked like bricks in the metal rectangular frame.  They must have been at least -13, and the frames sat very loose on the head.  Even just sitting around chatting they would constantly slide down the nose.  My friend liked to do fast layups and pivot around defenders, and frequently when taking the shot the glasses would finally slide right off the face and onto the floor.  Despite this happening multiple times per game they never broke, but I never understood why you would take the risk of throwing your glasses on the floor like that over and over.  Maybe my friend was hoping a foul would be called, but nobody touched the glasses, they just fell off!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;25 Apr 2018, 08:49</p><p>There was another girl wearing -4 glasses playing for the same team. A little older, tall and blonde- she used sports goggles for a very brief period but has since gotten lasik. There are 2 other girls that are mild plus wearers who goes without them while playing- a luxury the 2 shortsighted girls don't have with their level of myopia. </p><p> </p><p>It's very interesting to find high myopes playing sport although judging by the recent comments none of them are particularly great due to the fear of breaking their glasses </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;25 Apr 2018, 08:14</p><p>Re Fooball (soccer) playing girls wearing glasses.  </p><p>My daughter (17) wears very strong plus glasses (plus 26) and plays in our towns ladies football team.  Although she usually wears bifocals she wears a normal pair of single vision glasses to play in.   Im not really sure how she manages it but she doesnt seem to have a problem heading the ball although they do slide down her nose and she constantly has to push them up. She wont wear a strap!  She is short, slim and fast and usually plays forward and is the only girl in her team that wearing glasses.  </p><p>There is a team she plays against fairly often with another glasses wearing girl.  Hers are minus and also look pretty strong, Id guess around minus 15 possibly even more. The edges of the lenses look quite thick even though her frames are quite chunky plastic.  She plays quite carefully when going in for a tackle and Ive never seen her head the ball.  When other players get too close she holds up her arm to protect her precious specs.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2018, 05:46</p><p>I'm seeing more variety in frame styles than of late. It's always an interesting time when fashion is in flux.  </p><p> </p><p>And there's more metal frames, often rectangular. Thankfully there's no return to those ridiculous tiny frames we endured about a decade ago. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2018, 04:11</p><p>Noname, your soccer sighting reminds me of two sightings I had back when my daughter was playing soccer. I may have posted these before. </p><p> </p><p>The first was a girl about 14, who trained, but didn't play, on my daughter's team. She wore fairly strong, -8 or so, lined bifocals, and never wore contacts. She was a pretty blonde, friendly and warm. Both parents wore strong glasses, her mom well into the double digits. Her kid sister wore slightly weaker minus lined bifocals, and was always studying during practice, clearly looking through the bifocal part to read. The funny thing is that the mom refused to wear bifocals, even through she really needed them. It was fun to watch her take off her glasses to see things close up, like her phone, holding it just a few inches from her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>The other was a girl about 16 I saw at a soccer tournament. Her glasses weren't that strong, I'd guess -3 or -4, but they kept slipping down while she played. She had to push them up constantly. Don't know why she didn't get a strap for them, though I never saw them fall off. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glass Lenses</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2018, 01:30</p><p>Carrie </p><p> Vicky may be playing second fiddle to her new colleague if she gets glasses. Danielle may hit on her. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2018, 01:02</p><p>exploding elongated eyeballs?  omg such a dork.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Apr 2018, 09:00</p><p>Carrie </p><p>That was an interesting sighting. I think the blue-light glasses are probably helpful to anyone that spends their day staring at computer screens in reducing eyestrain. But I think too many are getting them instead of first getting their eyes examined to see if they might need prescription glasses. That seems to be the case with Vicky's co-worker. Now that she has Vicky's old glasses she should probably start wearing them instead of putting them on just to see her phone. As much as most young girls use their phone that would seem a bit annoying to constantly be putting on and taking off glasses every time she needs to check her phone. And working the checkout at the coffee shop she needs to be looking at small print quite often their too.  </p><p>So since you were with Danielle, as well as Gemma and Vicky, how is Danielle doing with wearing her glasses? Has she finally accepted that she needs to wear her glasses full time now? Did she decide not to get new contacts when she got her glasses?   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;22 Apr 2018, 02:40</p><p>On Saturday Danielle, Vicky, Gemma and I were in the coffee shop where Vicky works (Vicky wasn't working). Vicky's new colleague was in there and was on her break. She put on the same blue light blocking glasses that she wore the last time I saw her to look at her phone but took them off after a couple of minutes to rub her eyes and continued to look at her phone for a couple more minutes without the glasses before she rubbed her eyes again. Vicky asked her if she was ok. She said she was but her eyes still felt achy with or without the glasses. Vicky said "Perhaps it's not the blue light affecting your eyes. Try these." Vicky passed her a pair of glasses that turned out to be her old +0.5 ones. Vicky's colleague put them on looked at her phone and said "Wow, that feels better already!". Vicky told her that she doesn't need blue light blocking glasses she needs reading glasses and she can borrow her old glasses until she gets her own glasses. By this time her break was over, so she thanked Vicky and promised to look after Vicky's old glasses and get herself an eye test.  </p><p>Vicky had seen her colleague straining slightly to read her phone on several occasions over the last couple of weeks so decided to dig out her old glasses to see if they helped her colleague.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2018, 20:56</p><p>MisterMild </p><p> I agree , with Dasha's massive Rx, her elongated eyeballs must be about to explode.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MisterMild</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2018, 14:59</p><p>In fact, the most recent posting by Dasha - my all-time Russian myodisc favourite GWG - shows her riding a horse. It's a rather distant view, not worth reposting here, but I wonder how ill-advised that activity might be? She must surely be vulnerable to retinal detachment. Dasha has never previously posted about anything more vigorous than jogging on a cycle path. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2018, 01:20</p><p>anonymous and Soundmanpt,  </p><p> </p><p>This sighting reminds me of the football World Cup final in 1970 between Feyenoord (Rotterdam) and Estudiantes de la Plata (Argentina). Pinch hitter Joop van Daele scored the only goal. He did not wear contact lenses but prescription glasses. A frustrated Argentinian player then ripped off his glasses and another Estudiantes player smashed the glasses with his feet. The Argentinians declared later that it was forbidden to wear glasses in the tournament as they might be dangerous for the opponent in physical duels. The broken glasses were immortalized in a Dutch song that reached the charts. They are on display in the Feyenoord Museum. After the incident, Van Daele wisely switched to contact lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glass Lenses</b>&nbsp;19 Apr 2018, 23:02</p><p> That soccer player needs to talk to her doctor, to see if she has a risk of retinal detachment</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;19 Apr 2018, 19:36</p><p>No name </p><p>Interesting sighting for sure. Good for her for not letting her poor eyesight stop her from wanting to play sports. She really needs either contacts or sport glasses so she can fully compete. I instantly thought when you were describing her and saying that it was soccer that she was playing how risky that is with her wearing glasses. She was smart to avoid heading the ball but she was still at risk of someone kicking the ball in her face and breaking  her glasses. Their is no fear anymore of lenses shattering like they did years ago but the frame of her glasses could easily get broken and metal or plastic could cut her face or even worse cut her eye. </p><p>Years ago I managed my own women's softball team. Their ages ranged from 17 to 32 but most were around 21. I always worried because I had several girls that wore glasses and of course a softball isn't really soft. One of the girls wearing glasses was my 2nd baseman. We were having practice and I was hitting infield practice ground balls to them. I diodn't hit the ball as hard as I could but as hard as any other girl would ever hit a ball at them. When I hit one to my 2nd baseman it took bad bounce and came up and hit her right in the face. Her glasses went flying and she was hurt. Her glasses were a small rectangle style and the the nose pad cut the side of her noose so it was bleeding but she was okay. Her glasses were fine except I had to bend the nose piece back slightly. But she shook it off and it ddin't seem to scare her very much. I had the team for 12 years and as the girls were getting older I also lost interest.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;19 Apr 2018, 18:41</p><p>Unusual sighting last weekend. Was watching a local girls soccer game and one of the girls was wearing high minus glasses. Pretty cute late teens with long brunette hair wearing small metal frames bursting with thick lenses. I'm guessing -9. She was a bench warmer and sat down right infront of us after her warm ups. Kept turning to talk to her friend and her lenses showed ripples of power rings everytime she does.  </p><p> </p><p>What made it more interesting was mum and dad came down halfway through and it was clear why she had such poor eyesight. Mum wearing round metal frames and dad in clear lensed aviators showing plenty of thickness. Both nearing double digit prescriptions. </p><p> </p><p>Very odd to seeing extremely nearsighted athletic girls. She shied away from heading the ball a lot probably in fear of breaking her much needed glasses much to the detriment of her team.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2018, 03:28</p><p>Murky </p><p>You had a very nice sighting with that young lady. I know it made your day, but your complements also made her day as well. Nice line by the way saying that your daughter is always looking for high fashion frames. In the past I know you have often borrowed my line about having been an optician to chat with young ladies about their glasses and even get a look at them. It would make sense that with her job in pharmacy trying to read the small print on medicine bottles with long names and tricky spelling she was likely straining her eyes reading them. So a weak plus prescription is probably very helpful to her eyes with relaxing her eyes. Having her wear her glasses full time for a month so her eyes can get fully adjusted to her glasses should be enough that at the end of full time for the month she won't be able to read the small print anymore without her glasses. So if and when you go back I am pretty sure she will still be wearing her glasses. At work for sure and she may continue wearing them full time anyway since she will be quite used to them by then and if she's comfortable wearing her glasses then their is no reason to not continue wearing them.  </p><p>My local Costco store I have been friends with one of the opticians working their for several years. Over those years I have never once seen her wearing glasses. But Costco multi trains their people. As I was walking past the pharmacy department I noticed that she was working in that department. She was wearing glasses. I waved at her and pointed at her glasses. She came over to the order window and she was laughing. She said that she was asked to help out in pharmacy because one of the other girls was on maternity leave. She said that after the first week her eyes were killing her and she was getting headaches. So she went to her own department and got her eyes examined. She was prescribed with her first glasses. She said that she needs them for seeing close up and that she also has astigmatisms. She said that now that she was going to continue wearing them when returned to her optician job. True to her word when she returned to her own job she was still wearing her gasses. This was a few yeas ago. </p><p></p><hr>

An obvious Versace wheel at the angle on the arm, with a sparkling jewel at the center, and a clear aquamarine arm dissappearing behind shiny brown hair. Frotal view perfect, with gorgeous acetate lucent blue and red whorls, shoewing eyebrows above and high cheekbones below. 10/10 for choice.  </p><p>Prescription hard to judge, as hair blocks a distant view through the lens, but no power rings, and eyes look normal size, Are they planos? I wonder.. So </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for the pills.. how much do I owe? </p><p> </p><p>25 dollars please, we gave you a discount on the blood pressure one. </p><p> </p><p>Oh Thanks, and they are lovely glasses you are wearing, they suit your face so well.. </p><p>Gosh, thanks.  </p><p>If you dont mind me asking, who are they made by? My daughter is always looking for high fashion glasses, she would love those.  </p><p>Hm I dont konow who made them, not sure  ( a short pause, then.. the moment ) </p><p>She peels them off, looks at the arms </p><p>I see they are Versace.  </p><p>Can I have a look please at the model number?  </p><p>Hands them across the counter, I look through the lenses, to see that she is less thasn +1 L &amp; R. Maybe +0.5.I Note the serial number inside the arm.Caress them gently, and hand them back </p><p>They are truly lovely, your first pair?  </p><p>How did you know? I have had them about 3 weeks, my boyfriend suggested I get tested, as he though I was squinting. He is a doctor. </p><p>Do they help you see better?  </p><p>I cant notice much difference, but the eye doc said to wear them all the time for a month, then go back and talk to her. She said it was a weakprescription,and would help when I am tired and in bad light. They go dark in the sun, so double as sunglasses.I have a little bit of astigmatism., she said. I think the TV is a bit clearer. </p><p>They look expensive.I venture </p><p>Yes, just over 800 dollars with the lenses, but my boyfriend is a hospital junior doctor, and he paid half. My boss here, she paid the 180 dollars for ther lenses, as she said I needed to see well, reading labels all day. </p><p>Another customer enters the store.. so. </p><p>Well, welcome to the world of the glasses wearer, you have chosen well, when I come back in a month, I hope to see you still using them.Goodbye. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brett</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2018, 11:16</p><p>The house behind ours is a rental, and we share an alley access with it.  For about the last year there has been a college student living there, and I've never seen her with glasses. However, over the weekend, we were both outside and she was wearing what appeared to be really strong glasses so I went over closer to the alley where we would have a reason to chat/say hi.   </p><p> </p><p>1 eye was very strong it almost looked like a myodisc but couldn't actually tell if it was or just thickness.  The other lens was definitely double digits but not as strong.  Said hi, and didn't want to bring up, but as a responsive to how she was doing, she said not good because of having to wear glasses.   </p><p> </p><p>She mentioned that her eye doctor had just basically not given her any new contacts, said she had been wearing them too much/sleeping in them too much and said only glasses for at least the next couple months.  She was also saying she was having hard time getting used to the glasses, being seen in glasses, and self conscious about the whole ordeal.  I'm sure it is a big change.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lou</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2018, 06:32</p><p>Hi Carrie </p><p> </p><p>Thank you very much for the clarification.  </p><p> </p><p>Without meaning to or trying to interfere, I'm very surprised that Vicky didn't get a new prescription this time.  </p><p> </p><p>I would have thought that her previous prescription change from +0.50 Sph to +0.75 Sph - 0.25 Cyl would have been less significant, since as you know, +0.75 Sph - 0.25 Cyl equates to a prescription of +0.75 on one meridian and +0.50 on the other, which is not very different to a prescription of +0.50 on both meridians.  </p><p> </p><p>As you again know, the new change however to +0.50 Sph - 0.50 Cyl and +0.50 Sph - 0.75 Cyl, equates to +0.50 on one meridan/plano on the other,and +0.50 on one meridan/-0.25 the other.  </p><p> </p><p>Presuming that the axis is similar to before, Vicky's old glasses have a +0.50 prescription on the meridian that now requires a plano/-0.25 prescription, and surely the change in her prescription on this meridan, at +0.50 and +0.75 respectively, is equal to the size of her whole prescription, and therefore very significant in comparison to the size of her whole prescription. </p><p> </p><p>Presumably however Vicky feels that her current glasses are ok, or she would have chosen to update her prescription anyhow. </p><p> </p><p>All the best  </p><p> </p><p>Lou  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2018, 22:56</p><p>On Saturday we were in the coffee shop where Vicky works and I noticed a very attractive new member of staff behind the counter. A bit later on when she was on a break she sat near us and got her phone out and then put on a pair of glasses. Vicky said to her "I like your reading glasses.". The new girl said "Thanks. They are actually blue light blocking glasses. I sometimes get headaches when looking at my phone, especially for long periods." She then held them up to the light before polishing the lenses and putting them on. I could see there was no prescription in them, sadly. I asked her if they worked. She said she's only had them a week so she's not sure as she still sometimes gets a headache. I asked her if she had got her eyes tested recently. She said she hasn't done since she was at school but doesn't think she needs glasses and doesn't particularly want glasses. </p><p>We let her get back to her phone and carried on our chatting.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2018, 12:09</p><p>I just came from my doctors appointment for my sleep apnea and I was just their a month ago because they had to adjust my cpap machine and they wanted to check the results with me to the new settings. Anyway the nurse was the same one that cane in last time to take my vitals and go over medications and such only this time she was wearing glasses. I couldn't help but notice her fiddling with her glasses as she was asking me questions. So when she was finished I asked her if she had just recently started wearing glasses? She smiled at me and asked how i could tell? I told her that I remembered her form my past visit and she wasn't wearing glasses then and now she was and she seemed like she was still getting used to wearing them because she was fiddling with them as she was asking me questions. She said I was very observant and that she had just got them last week and she is still getting used to wearing glasses. She said that she doesn't really need to wear them all the time but she wants to wear them all the time because  the fluorescent lights bother her eyes and the AR coating on her glasses really helps with that. She said that in the few days she has had them she already feels like her eyes are getting dependent on her glasses. She said that she took them off while she was driving to wipe a smudge off of them and she was surprised how blurry everything was with her glasses off. I told her how nice she looked wearing glasses and she said that her husband likes how she looks wearing glasses too. I have to go back in 2 weeks so I hope to see here  again and see how she is doing with getting used to her glasses.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2018, 20:09</p><p>In south east Asia and using public buses.  A group of school girls all in uniform and looking to be about 15 years old get on the bus.  There are six of them and five wear glasses for myopia ranging from -2 to -6 in my estimation.  No NHS frames here though - all wearing modern designer looking frames but with a predominance of large round and black designs. </p><p> </p><p>Same bus a group of younger girls in a different uniform get on, four this time of which 3 wear glasses.  About 13 years old.  Two of the three wear noticeable bifocals.  The most extreme has frames which are almost round and the bifocal is a diagonal across the centre of the lens.  Noticeable minus in the top segment, maybe -4 and powerful plus in the bottom segment.  The other girl is unusual in that she is positioning her glasses so as to read her phone through the upper minus segment and not the bifocal reading add. </p><p> </p><p>It's a small sample but seems to confirm the myopia epidemic in the region.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>M2</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2018, 20:54</p><p>George,  </p><p>You're too sweet to offer that, but what makes you think I need prop glasses to talk to men? Besides, I think both men I mentioned are in relationships. I'm a good many things, but a woman who flirts with taken men isn't one of them.  </p><p> </p><p>While I'm here, a sighting from the past couple days...at a restaurant, eavesdropping on a conversation behind me while waiting for my dinner companion. Guy and woman, second date maybe?  Both in their early to mid-30s. Guy says something about the NCAA tournament game on tv, woman replies, guy admits "I can't quite see the score, I wear glasses sometimes, I'm a little blind."   This, of course, piques my interest and I make sure to take a look when I get up to use the bathroom.  Guy has gray wire-framed glasses,very low minus but some cylinder, lying on table. He must've been keeping them in a pocket earlier in the date.  </p><p> </p><p>When I came back from the bathroom, he had the glasses on and was watching the game but the woman had passed me coming back from the bathroom. He looked good with the glasses on and I wanted to tell him she probably wouldn't mind if he just wore them so he could really see the game. He was decent looking, thinning gray-brown hair, neatly trimmed beard, tech-bro casual outfit. Noticeable cylinder in the lenses, enough that I suspect he probable wears them more than "sometimes". </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>George</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2018, 18:11</p><p>M2 </p><p>You know if you were to order yourself a nice looking pair of glasses with a weak prescription of say -.75 or maybe -1.00 which your eyes shouldn't have any problem tolerating it would give you something to talk to these men at your sales meetings instead of just looking at them. You could do some fiddling with your glasses and comment about how you just recently got glasses and how you're trying to get used to wearing them. Maybe even ask for pointers from them.Glasses are fairly cheap online. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>M2</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2018, 15:42</p><p>Anonymous poster, you're mostly right. I am a mom  and I enjoy seeing men in glasses. No glasses for me yet. I'm in my mid-30s and have good vision but I know presbyopia will come in due time.  </p><p> </p><p>Another sighting while I'm here and it's another presbyopic man. Must be the crowd I hang out with. I was at several days of sales meetings for work this week and saw a guy who I see periodically. He's in another region but I see him a few times a year at large work events. Mid- or late-40s, shorter, nice build, dark brown hair thinning a bit but styled well to embrace what he's got without looking silly (side note, men: comb-overs and attempt to hide hair loss are not fooling anyone. lots of guys with little hair look great, just own it).  </p><p> </p><p>But back to the glasses. He is definitely dependent on this pair for anything up close, they are rectangular, maybe +2, bronze frames. A nice match for his coloring. He's had them as long as I've seen him at these meetings, at least three years. But the last couple times I've seen him, he doesn't always whip them off to look into the distance. There were a few instances this time when he left them on to look up at a power point or something in the distance. Of course, once he realized he was looking through those lenses, he slid them off. Or onto his forehead, which was really kind of cute. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>M2</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2018, 16:43</p><p>This is a near-sighting that became a sighting.  </p><p>About a year and a half ago, I would see this same dad at my daughter's soccer practice, trying desperately to hold his phone far enough away to see it to text or email. It probably didn't help that it was dusk. I would notice him and wonder to myself if he was living deep in denial or just too vain to put his readers on.  </p><p> </p><p>The season ended and I forgot about it, until this weekend when I was at a different sporting event and I saw him again, but now with a nice pair of black rimmed glasses that he wore the whole time. He's a good looking guy, probably late 40s, salt and pepper hair, tall and broad, and they suited him well.  </p><p> </p><p>I was across a field from him, but my guess is they're progressives. Wonder if he started with readers or went full-time from the start, and just how long after those fall nights that he held out, trying-and failing-to see his phone screen clearly.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>pete-it</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2018, 09:44</p><p>I went into a small coffee shop in south London this morning. To my delight the lady barrista, maybe about 40 years old had a pair of stunning glasses, they were a very large frame and the left lens was square with a red frame and the right was round with a white frame...guessing in the region of - 4...all very nice and made the coffee buying even sweeter</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adam</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2018, 11:10</p><p>Two sightings this week in Tesco hipermarket: </p><p>On Monday, I saw a cashier with about -10 glasses and I think she had some astigmatism, too. Behind the lenses I saw that she has nice big brown eyes.  </p><p>Today, I saw a girl with light blue eyes. Her eyes were squinty all the time and she was squinting hard even looking at closer distances, too.

<p><b>Saman</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2018, 09:00</p><p>Hi.

When she turns her head we can clearly see the thickness of her right lens. It's around 10mm thick came our from the frame. When she turns forward her right eye looks very tiny. </p><p>I was So excited. I'm thinking her vision without those glasses...  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pyrofan</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2018, 07:57</p><p>Great sighting at a work function earlier. A lady walked in wearing very bulky sunglasses that looks like those VR goggles. Thought it was a very odd choice of sunglasses but soon found out why- she took them off and revealed a second pair of small plastic rimmed glasses perched on her nose with very strong minus lenses in the -10 range. She is quite overweight (but quite pretty) and those glasses barely fit her face. She took them off a few times during the afternoon to rub her eyes and the red marks on her nose tells us how heavy those myopic glasses must be!  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lou</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2018, 03:02</p><p>Hi Colin </p><p> </p><p>Yes, I imagine that sellotape wouldn't be very successful with thick glass lenses.  I saw someone recently with plastic glasses with both arms sellotaped on, and surprisingly this was a woman in her early twenties. </p><p> </p><p>Since the Specsavers glasses range start at £25 including lenses, and they have modern styles, I can't see much need nowadays for people having to resort to sellotape for other than a temporary fix. Maybe this young lady had broken her glasses very recently. </p><p> </p><p>All the best </p><p> </p><p>Lou </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2018, 16:42</p><p>Lou, </p><p>I think the sellotape wasnt up to holding the glasses together.   Lenses were glass in those days and Cheryls thick lenses were really heavy.  I think their weight made them slew round at an angle on her nose despite her continually adjusting them.  She really seemed to be struggling that day.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lou</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2018, 11:49</p><p>Hi Colin </p><p> </p><p>You are very welcome. </p><p> </p><p>Best wishes </p><p> </p><p>Lou</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2018, 08:16</p><p>Lou, </p><p>Cheers for that.    </p><p>Although I was glad that Cheryl got her nice new glasses and could obviously see much better I really loved seeing her walking around with the old repaired glasses on the end of her nose tilting her head right back to see.  Her magnified eyes looked lovely.  It lasted about a week till she got the new tinted spex </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lou</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2018, 07:04</p><p>Hi </p><p> </p><p>Yes, Sellotape is a brand name. </p><p> </p><p>i.e. https://sellotape.co.uk/ </p><p> </p><p>However, since we generally refer to vacuum cleaners in the UK as hoovers, we use the word sellotape to describe clear or slightly goldish/yellowish tinted sticky tape. </p><p> </p><p>Best wishes </p><p> </p><p>Lou</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2018, 06:53</p><p>I think sellotape is a brand name in the U.K.  </p><p>What I found so fascinating about Cheryl (the typist) </p><p>was that she treated her glasses as reading glasses even though she had difficulty seeing in the distance without them.   I dont think she liked them. She must have had them for some time as they looked pretty old and she didnt have a spare pair, perhaps at school she had enough accommodation to use them for reading only.    </p><p>Her new glasses were slightly tinted, perhaps to hide their strength, and much more fashionable.   Everyone in the office told her how good they looked and I got the feeling she didnt mind wearing them quite so much.  She certainly grew in confidence as time went on. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2018, 16:47</p><p>The posts about young ladies wearing reading glasses reminded me of a girl I worked with in the late 60s.   She was a typist in our office and although I didnt ask her age I guess it was similar to mine, late teens.  </p><p>She was quite shy and wore strong plus glasses to read with lenses that bulged right out, on the end of her nose.  She didnt put them on until she got to her desk and took them off when she finished typing.  They were brown plastic roundish, just loose in her bag which shed rummage through to find them and looked as though shed had them some time. The side pieces seemed loose and bent out and back  where they were bent almost vertically behind her ears. Sometimes she looked over the top of them but whenever we spoke she lifted her head back to look through the lenses which magnified her eyes enormously. She also looked through them to see out of the window.    </p><p>One day I noticed one of the side pieces sellotaped on, the hinge had broken and they were angled across her nose.   She was really struggling.    </p><p>I had repaired my own glasses before with an epoxy resin and suggested that I could try it on hers. At the end of the day she gave me the glasses and asked if I could sort them out for work tomorrow.    </p><p>The following morning she was really grateful for the temporary repair and said she hadnt realised how bad her eyes had got as she couldnt really see to eat her dinner and couldnt see the telly!     She kept the glasses on all the time until she got her new glasses which looked slightly stronger and which she  contined to wear all the time. These glasses were more fashionable, the lady in charge said she had got more cocky since she had her new glasses! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2018, 16:05</p><p>At the airport this week, seated at the gate waiting for my flight to board. </p><p>Sat next to me a business woman, Asian features, very well dressed in a slim black suit, white blouse, black heels, beautiful long hair, carrying a briefcase. Not older than 35 I guess. </p><p> </p><p>What I noticed most of course where her glasses, which sat steady on top of her head. Larger round semi transparent light pink plastic frames, clear temples, they did not look very expensive but still very nice. I was reading some papers myself, and her glasses stayed on her head until after about 5 minutes, when she took her iphone and started surfing google, facebook,... Only then did I notice that the lenses where a very clear plus, and when looking at the screen showing all flights a few meters from us, she pushed her glasses halfway down her nose and looked over the lenses to read the flight announcements. It was very clear the next 10 minutes that she could read nothing on her iphone, neither from papers that came out of her briefcase, without the help of her glasses. But whenever she watched something further away, she either peered over the lenses, took off her specs, or pushed them up her head. </p><p> </p><p>Very sexy and amazing thqt such young woman is so dependent already upon reading glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NNVisitor</b>&nbsp;01 Feb 2018, 23:35</p><p>I was on a bus about 12 days ago. A woman in her twenties got on and I immediatly noticed that she was wearing plus glasses with a very noticable astigmatism correction. She stood on the bus with her back towards me the rest of the bus trip. Before I had to get off I noticed a small round message pin on her daypack. At first I had trouble reading it. Then I was able to read the pins inscription. It said "fuck you your stare". Quite surprising indeed. So everyone reading this please don't stare at strangers wearing glasses. It's one thing to glance occasionally but lets face it no one wants a stranger staring at them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Feb 2018, 13:18</p><p>Carrie </p><p>It's been a while since I saw any comments from you. You had an interesting sighting didn't you? Always nice to see a newly prescribed glasses wearer. I guess we could even call her a "virgin" glasses wearer since these are her first glasses. I really like seeing a young woman wearing a nice pair of aviator style glasses. But i'm not crazy about the way over size ones. I am more into the smaller style. Because these are her first glasses I would think they the prescription might be closer to -.75 but not more than -1.00. Without maybe trying on her glasses it would be difficult to tell if there was any astigmatism correction in her glasses. If she only got them on Saturday and you saw her on Monday or Tuesday she was probably told to wear them for about a week or 10 days so her eyes would have some time to adjust to her prescription and so she could get used to wearing glasses. Then it would be up to her as to when she feels like she needs or wants to war her glasses except that she is now required to wear her glasses whenever she is driving. Even with -.75 glasses she wouldn't be able to see the 20/40 line which is where see needed to able to see without glasses in order to not need glasses for driving. if her glasses were closer to -1.50 she might have been instructed to wear her glasses full time. That's about where many people do start wearing their glasses all the time. But even -.75 as her eyes continue to fully adjust to them will make enough of a difference that when she takes her glasses off now things are noticeably more blurry to her then they were on Saturday before she got her glasses. It will be interesting for you to see if she comes back in wearing glasses or not. Remember if drives to your store theirs a very good chance that she won't bother taking her glasses off if she is just making a quick stop at your store. But if she does take them off do you think you would able to recognize her without her glasses?  </p><p>On another point. I must have missed a comment from you at some point because I didn't know that you finally convinced Danielle to take your old glasses. I just saw Lisa asking you if she is now wearing your old glasses full time instead of her own glasses and I wonder the very same thing? I'm sure your old glasses are much closer to what she should be wearing. Her own glasses are probably fine for driving still because she probably doesn't need an increase for distance just close up. That's why she should really consider getting progressives so her distance vision won't be forced to continue getting worse with stronger single vision glasses.Has she said when she plans on getting her eyes examined again?       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2018, 12:13</p><p>I saw a new wearer today when I was at work. She was probably just a few years younger than me. Her glasses were thin metal Aviator style frames with mild minus lenses. Her prescription was probably about -1 to -1.50 as there was very little cut-in, although I only got a brief look when she paid for her shopping. I couldn't tell if there was any astigmatism correction in the lenses. She saw a friend just before leaving. The friend commented on the glasses saying she didn't know the first woman wore glasses. The first woman replied that she only got glasses for the first time on Saturday and should wear them at any time she wants to see clearer but must wear them for driving. She is still getting used to them. Her friend asked if everything was much clearer with glasses than without. She said it was surprisingly clearer than she thought it was going to be and was told she could wear them all the time if she wanted to. The friend asked if she was going to wear them all the time but the woman replied that she probably wouldn't. I was disappointed to hear that she wasn't going to wear her glasses full time. I wondered how long she had been driving while needing glasses and how she managed to pass her driving test, but I suppose her vision had probably deteriorated since she started driving.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2018, 10:59</p><p>Seen a Indian mother daughter sighting today at the doctors- both high myopes. Mother in her 50s wearing semi rimless glasses with a -8 prescription, as expected they were quite thick and very visible with. She played with her granddaughter a lot on the ipad and shifted her glasses right to the tip of her nose to read like they were reading glasses which these clearly were not. </p><p> </p><p>Her daughter, stunning lady in her late 20s had a pair of black oval shaped frames with at least a -10 prescription </p><p>Flat fronted with a little edge thickness off the side, power rings galore and her face minimized from each side when looking at her straight on. She was struggling to control her children who were running around and at one point her very young son started hitting her and caught her glasses and fell onto the bench. Immediately very concerned, she groped for them and inspected them for damage (with the glasses held very close to her face so her poorly functioning eyes could see) before sliding them onto her nose. Grandma then explained to the boy to not hit or play with mummy's glasses as she cannot see without them. The poor mum just held her head in her hands in frustration. The high myopia genes seem strong in this family so the young boy and daughter will probably end up being blind as a bat too like mum and grandma! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lou</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2018, 05:31</p><p>Hi Tom </p><p> </p><p>Even though she is only in her late twenties, maybe her glasses are progressives whereas her contact lenses are only single vision. </p><p> </p><p>Just a thought. </p><p> </p><p>All the best </p><p> </p><p>Lou</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2018, 04:37</p><p>This Monday a new young lady started a new job within our Legal Department. Not older then late twenties judging from her past working experience of a few years only with a law firm. Stylish, slender, shoulder-long blonde, and nice looking light-brownish round tortoiseshell glasses. </p><p> </p><p>As we spent some time together at my desk when I also introduced her to what I do at the company, I could have some good looks at her specs: her lenses are thin but have very noticeable power rings. When standing behind her, queuing for lunch at the cafeteria, I could see that everything through her lenses looked truly small, meaning her prescription must be rather strong. </p><p> </p><p>This morning however, I saw she was not in glasses. She must have contacts in and she clearly functioned well. During a meeting she was surprisingly squinting real hard but only when reading papers in front of her, or when looking at her iPhone, but not when watching the presentation on screen in the meeting room. How can this be? I never noticed this when she was in glasses the other days, but today very noticeable. Anyway, good she joined the company :) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Colin</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2018, 09:10</p><p>Just seen two girls wearing the strongest myodisc glasses Ive ever seen! </p><p>Our building firm sponsor a Boxing Club and weve been helping to do up their new premises. We were carrying some materials in the front door and they stopped to let us pass.  They both looked in their 20s but one younger than the other.  I thanked them and noticed that both their glasses had a tiny myodisc circle in the middle of their lenses. Im really not exaggerating, at most 20mm diameter.  They asked what the building was going to be and I jumped at the chance of a chat!  I think they might have been impressed with several of the fit young lads around.   </p><p>We showed them round the club.  Their eyes looked so tiny behind the thick lenses but they could both obviously see ok as they looked around.    </p><p>They had Eastern European accents and a slightly tanned skin.  Both were extreme well dressed the older girl wearing thigh length suede boots and shirt skirt a designer suede jacket.  The younger wore jeans and a leather jacket.   </p><p>I said the club was opening shortly and suggest they might like to join the ladies section.  The older one laughed and said she wouldnt be any good because of her glasses.  I also wear quite strong plus glasses and said I know what you mean and explained that I was just doing the building work there. As we walked round the older girl kept pushing her glasses up which continually slid down her nose.   </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2018, 10:05</p><p>Saw a mid 20s girl at the food court earlier. Quite pretty, short with long black hair tied up and wearing a large black glasses with around a -9 lenses. She sat at a table and immediately started taking out some stuff from her bag which I noticed to be contact lens paraphernalia- fresh from the visit to the eye doctor, and proceeded to take her glasses off to put in some eye drops. Interestingly, she was in no rush to put her glasses back on and played on her phone. </p><p> </p><p>She had her fresh contacts ready to put in but was called to pick up her food in which she decided not to worry about putting her lenses in and put her glasses on instead (probably a wise decision as she would've probably struggled to find the counter, let alone navigate her way there and back carrying a tray of food at her level of myopia). Glasses was off and on as she needed to put her eye drops in throughout the meal. Managed to sneak in a few peeks at the thickness and power rings of her glasses knowing that she couldn't see me without her corrective lenses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>murky</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2018, 17:22</p><p>What is the maximum that a 20-25 yo can accommodate?  I see the post below can make +5, maybe Cactus Jack or S/M have a table for us of age vs </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Murky</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2018, 17:15</p><p>Agreed Bert, </p><p>at the local supermarket, one of the youg cashiers wears at least +4, she puts them on the work the register, then on to the forehead to patrol the shelves, and i see her sqauinting at the products and prices. Anything beyond +3 is better worn constantly, I think, but then, as withthe case below, if they can accommodate and see, they they prefer to be bare eyeed. Her glasses are tranparent acetate, highly fashionalbe too, and she looks so good in them, I am always loking for a conversation about it, but the moment has not arrived yet</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2018, 08:51</p><p>Plusglasses/Bert </p><p> </p><p>Unless you've got significant astigmatism it should be possible to manage without. Having some spare accommodation due to being young (ie twenties) helps.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>plusglasses</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2018, 07:01</p><p>@bert. I am hyperopic myself with a prescription of +5.25 dpt and some astigmatism. I'm 32 years old. Although my eyes feel like receiving a wellness treatment when I have my glasses on I often go without or have them on my sweater collar and put them on whenever I need them (for close up i cannot see anything without my glasses for longer than maybe 10 seconds) but for far I see well, not super-hd-well but ok to get around without them on my nose all the time. </p><p>So I agree - we farsighted people do have the ability to accomodate (hopefully for many more years :-) ).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bert</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2018, 03:41</p><p>I never cease to be amazed by the apparent ability of hyperopic people to accommodate and manage without their glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>On the train yesterday I was near a girl who wore heavy plus glasses to read and use her iPhone. At least + 5, possibly more, as the lens stuck out noticeably in front. Too young to be merely presbyopic. She kept them on to look round the train car. However when she stopped using her iPhone she pushed her glasses onto the top of her head, where they stayed when she got off the train. Fascinating. I did wonder how well she can see in the distance, but I've seen other women in their 20s and 30s make only occasional use of plus glasses with quite high prescriptions.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Murky</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2018, 17:19</p><p>A new years eve party. </p><p>A waitress, serving canapes, immaculatey dressed in Black, with diamong drooping earrings, wore a gorgeous pair of Black dior frames, smallish lenses, wide arms, with gold braid liad along. I noted that she knew a lot of customers, and always took off her glass to kiss them on the cheek, a sure sign of a recent wearer.  </p><p>Moving to behind her, I estimated about +1, a touch of astgmatic correction for ther left eye too. About 40, but still beautiful face, and top figure, size 10 perhaps.  </p><p>I stood close to the kitchen door, admiring a picture, and just obstructing entrance, she returned to the kitchen, and the following took place  </p><p> </p><p>"Scuse me, need to go into the kitchen </p><p>Oh, sorry, (and I turn toward her)fixing her in my vision </p><p>What a lovely pair of glasses you are wearing, Wow.. </p><p>Thanks,  she makes to move on  </p><p>I am a retired optometrist,( the Soundman line, rarely fails) and am always interested in people who know how to wear glasses well, where did you get them, please?  </p><p>At OPSM, in the mall, </p><p>They look expensive, so fashionable too. </p><p>Are they your first pair?  </p><p>Yes, how did you guess?  </p><p>I saw you taking them off to greet your clients, its a sure sign of a new wearer, because you probably like people to see you without them, being a new wearer.  </p><p> </p><p>Do I?

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2018, 15:44</p><p>A couple of days ago I ran across a couple of young women in the local shopping mall. One wore attractive tortoiseshell plastic frames, the other less interesting black frames.  </p><p> </p><p>I didn't have time to catch more than a glance as I was with someone else, and anyway I don't want to stare. But for some time afterwards I was running the variables of thickness, base curve and possible lens materials through my head in search of an estimated level of myopia. </p><p> </p><p>Such is the life of an OO. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2018, 12:13</p><p>At work today a fairly regular customer came in. I've seen her wear glasses occasionally before and recently more often. She used to wear quite simple metal framed glasses with a weak minus prescription. Today she was wearing dark brown, slightly cat-eye shaped, plastic frames. The lenses looked slightly stronger. I complimented her on her new, pretty frames. She thanked me and said she needed a stronger prescription as things just weren't as clear as they should have been when she wore her old glasses that she's had for several years and only wore for distances. When she put her new glasses on she realised how clear everything should be and thought it might be a good idea to wear them all the time. </p><p>She is around late 20s early 30s and fairly attractive with straight brown hair down to just below her shoulders. Her glasses match her hair colour. Her best feature are her blue eyes which seem to sparkle more behind her new glasses than with her old glasses or no glasses at all. She is a little bit curvy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2017, 14:53</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Things like that do bring back memories. In this case very good memories of Gemma. Was this before you or Gemma was wearing glasses? Actually Gemma, as I recall had glasses, but she wasn't comfortable wearing glasses yet and her prescription was still weak enough that she could get by without her glasses. Was this the party right after you had started wearing glasses yourself?  </p><p>I'm shocked to hear you say that any woman looks better without her glasses. But to be honest sometimes it seems like people have no taste in glasses. It sounds like the frames i have seen recently that are very thick, bold and big and they cover way too much of the face area. She said that she took her glasses off because her prescription had changed and with her glasses being stronger her eyes were still trying to adjust to her stronger glasses. But I winder if it could also have been because her glasses are heavier than her previous glasses so nose needed a break as much as her eyes did. Her answer as to how badly she needed her glasses to see with was interesting as well. If you're anywhere close to guessing her prescription and you seem pretty good at doing that then when her eyes are fully adjusted to her glasses I doubt that she would be able to see people's faces across the table from her. Now if she had only had her glasses for a day or so and her previous glasses were considerably weaker than her eyes wouldn't be fully adjusted to her glasses yet and it's possible that she was still able to see across he room without her glasses slightly better. but I totally agree with you that it really does make a difference which glasses a person is wearing as to how good the look wearing them. But were both not overly picky when we see an attractive woman wearing glasses are we,  </p><p>What;s the New years Eve plans for Gemma and Carrie? Do your plans include Danielle and Vicky? Whatever you do be safe and have a good time.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>James X.</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2017, 13:16</p><p>Eyestein...Thank you for the link to that picture of Lauren Elizabeth.  Sad to see she went back to smaller frames, but happy she is still out there.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eyestein</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2017, 23:08</p><p>I might have mentioned this sighting previously but it would have been years ago. The subject is a high plus check-out girl who once served me in a shopping centre.  </p><p> </p><p>I found myself in her queue and I was quite happy to wait there and watch while not obviously staring. Her general appearance was average but nice. She had blonde hair but brown eyes. As I got closer her glasses really caught my attention but not only because they were high plus. Her lens material had an unusual clarity and intense sparkle. It was like looking at lead crystal or diamond. </p><p> </p><p>I got the immediate impression that it was not polycarbonate or any kind of plastic. Her frames were small and had kind of a heavily rounded off heart shape. In spite of that her lenses were still fairly thick. One lens was thicker than the other. I still reckon that what I saw that day was 1.8 or 1.9 ultra-high index real optical glass. Her glasses were obviously heavy because they frequently slid down her nose and she had to push them back up whenever she had a free hand. </p><p> </p><p>Her narrow field of vision was obvious because she could not look up or down or sideways without moving her head up and down and sideways. She did that constantly. Her prescription must have been very high - like one would normally associate with legal blindness. She obviously was not legally blind as her occupation demonstrated. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, when it was my turn to be served I said very little to her because of all the people around and the place was busy. I did learn she had a sweet voice and nice manners. I understand that 1.9 optical glass is banned for glasses in the US because of it's brittleness. This sighting was in Australia</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2017, 17:36</p><p>We went to a party just before Christmas. 7 years ago at the same location with the same host and a lot of the same people attending I got chatting to someone I remembered from school. That person was Gemma, so this particular party always brings back very special memories for both of us. </p><p>At this year's party I a woman of a similar age to me, perhaps a bit younger. She was wearing glasses with a very thick tortoiseshell frame. The lenses were probably no more than -3. At one point she sat down at a table and took her glasses off. I hate to say it but she was prettier without her glasses. Maybe a different style would have looked better on her. There were a few other people at the table but there was room for me (Gemma had gone to get me a drink). Someone asked her if glasses were strong. She replied with an Italian accent that they weren't strong but needed them to see far away. Someone else asked how badly she needed glasses. She replied that people on the other side of the room were difficult to see properly. The same person asked why she had taken her glasses off. She said that she was resting her eyes as the prescription was stronger than her old glasses and seeing so clearly was taking some getting used to. I didn't hear any more as Gemma phoned me as she had forgotten which I was in, so I went to find her!&#128516;</p><p></p><hr>

The hostess was very pretty around 19 with shoulder length straight brown hair wearing black leather skirt, black sheer top and black ankle boots. To my surprise she was wearing an eye patch! I was sat near the entrance so I could watch her periodically. She had many comments from the regular customers and I think I heard her say she had some sort of eye incident but no further information. A few times I noticed her closing her good eye tightly for a few seconds and then trying to refocus after. Was neat to watch. </p><p></p><hr>

This the final race of the the season, so it must have been in Oct of '92 or '92. With some of my racing friends I went to a strip club in Atlanta (Cheeta III?). What a place - there were 3 or 4 stages with girls dancing all the time The girls were constantly changing. What made me happy was several of the dancers wore glasses (real prescription glasses). In the two hours we were there I saw 3 beautiful GWG dancers. I don't regret spending the cover charge I spent to get in there.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2017, 19:33</p><p>I've been in several Hooters, Tilted Kilt, etc. across the USA and seen many GWGs often with relatively strong (at least very real) prescriptions. It's not really such a big deal.  Guys dig chicks with glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

She has a -9 prescription, but seems to wear contacts almost all the time. There are some pictures of her wearing non-prescription frames, which I am guessing she uses an accessory sometimes when she dresses up for work. </p><p> </p><p>It just got me wondering how many other severely nearsighted (or farsighted) girls are out there, waiting tables at these places that place a premium on the sex appeal of their waitstaff, hiding their poor vision with contacts. I have to imagine few of these girls ever come to work in their thick specs unless they have no other choice. </p><p> </p><p>So, has anyone ever seen something like this?

The glasses worn by a jolly, short, cuddly-plump girl of about 20 with a pretty face, milk-chocolate complexion, with woolly hat and scarf, her big round eyes glowing behind the minus lenses (perhaps about -12d).  As we shared a pole at different heights, the view from obliquely above and behind when she turned her head was of many power rings and some lens edge sticking out behind the thick blue-black plastic frames which are just slightly too big. </p><p> </p><p>Oh, to be young again! But sadly I had to get off at the next stop.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cubicle</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2017, 13:25</p><p>I saw a couple of pretty girls in shops... </p><p>First shop, one employee is a tall curly blonde that moves her head a lot. She had tortoise like plastic frames with quite thick plus lenses that protrude a lot. Difficult to tell her prescription but quite high. She is delightful.  </p><p>The second girl is at the bakery. Blonde hair blue eyes, big boobs and big -10 glasses that slide a bit. She looks at the change very close to her eyes while squinting. I have a reason to buy more bread ! </p><p>But I can't ask them for their glasses brand or something </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2017, 04:58</p><p>One of the best sightings ever had today. Very cute Mid 20s blonde girl working at an electronics store. She was looking through lenses that must be at least -13 in a large thick black frame (probably the only type of frame that can support those lenses!) </p><p> </p><p>Her glasses must've cost her a fortune as no noticeable lens thickness, although nothing could be done about the cut in and power rings which still easily suggests that she is blind as a bat. Everything was minuscule when I looked behind her and through the lenses. </p><p> </p><p>She seems to be the type that takes a lot of pride in her appearance judging by how heavily made up she was even for work. Definitely not the kind you'd associate with this kind of nearsightedness. Probably a contact lens wearer who would've been mortified to have to wear her glasses for the day.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2017, 16:45</p><p>NN Visitor </p><p>No i agree with you. i didn't mean to make it sound as if she was near blindness without her glasses just more difficult for her than her friend that was wearing her glasses. The longer her friend was wearing her glasses the more her eyes were adjusting to them. Probably the only reason she was starting to get a headache from wearing the glasses was that they probably also had some astigmatism in them and that was what was starting to give her a headache. If she wore them most of the afternoon by the time she returned them she was probably seeing pretty good with them. In the end they both must have had fun trading places.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

I cross streets at traffic light and can see through the blur green from red lights, the closer vehicles and I try to cross streets when others are crossing. My glasses are -10 with astigmatism near -2 way worse vision than this lady with -3 glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Sure things are blurry for her and much more for me.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Oct 2017, 08:20</p><p>Michael </p><p>I'm sure the owner of the glasses had a much harder time trying to see without her than her friend did while wearing her glasses. Even though her friend's glasses were way too strong for her eyes she was still able to see wearing them even though they made everything much smaller. Had the glasses only been around -1.50 she would have been able to wear them all day without any issues and they would have been very comfortable to her. Did they say why they did that. The young lady that the glasses belonged to had to very uncomfortable without her glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;16 Oct 2017, 05:18</p><p>I was standing along the football pitch last weekend, watching my son play a game. It didnt take long before I noticed a soccer mom standing 20m further down the side line, talking to another woman. I saw how the sun reflected in her glasses, and I eased my way closer to her. To me delight she wore my all-time favorite Chanel 3221Q frames, those in which Emma Watson looked so exquisitely cute. </p><p> </p><p>I noticed her lenses had sizeable minus prescription were still remarkably thin. I was clear from her overall classy appearance that she could afford not only the expensive frames, but also the thinner high-index lenses. </p><p> </p><p>She really made my day when she took off her glasses, held them with both hands 40cm from her face up in the air, blew on the lenses, and squinting hard she was trying to find the small smear or bit of dust that clearly bothered her. She then patiently rubbed her lenses with a tip of her scarf, put them back on, adjusted them other nose, but they came off again. The same ritual was done two more times before she was happy with the clarity of the lenses. I the meanwhile she didnt stop talking to her friend besides her, who didnt seem to have any interest in glasses or vision, and tried all the time to continue to follow the game, which treated me to several great squints. </p><p> </p><p>She had her hair in a tight pony tail, which allowed for a great view onto the full length of the delicately ornate temples of her glasses. Quite an afternoon I must say!    </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2017, 10:37</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I'm no expert on the matter and I never had kids but I think it's because baby's have small hands so they can't really grab onto your face but glasses are much easier to grab onto. Also they could be attracted to the shinyness of glasses as well. You and Gemma were quite smart in taking your glasses off before holding her baby. I get the idea you may have already experienced having a baby grab your glasses off your face before which is why you knew to take them off this time?  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;13 Oct 2017, 14:31</p><p>Miku </p><p>She had them on the top of her head and then put them on the table when she picked her baby up. I don't know how much she actually needs them, that was all she said. She didn't use them when we were there. </p><p>I meant to also say in my last post that Gemma did the same as me when she cuddled the baby. She wasn't going to risk her glasses with a baby that doesn't seem to like seeing them on people's faces!&#128515;</p><p></p><hr>

Sometimes it happens to discover such things and at times, I am the subject of such a discovery myself. </p><p> </p><p>May I ask how you ended up discovering that your friend is a glasses wearer? And any idea, how much she actually needs them for fine print? Could it be that she can read just fine without any correction, but feels her eyes straining? That's pretty much my case and I have a stronger RX than what you estimated she does. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks, </p><p> </p><p>M</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cubicle</b>&nbsp;12 Oct 2017, 11:21</p><p>The other day in the subway I saw a beautiful young woman. Late 20s, long brown hair, beautiful face and big black plastic glasses. The lenses were at least -12. Lots and lots of cut-in. </p><p>I wanted to ask her out and try them on but she was with a guy. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;12 Oct 2017, 00:09</p><p>I've just discovered that one of my friends has worn glasses for reading since she was 15. She is now 30 and I've never seen her wear them until now despite knowing her for at least 5 years! She said she only wears them for looking at very fine print or long periods of reading and still has the same prescription as her first glasses. At her last eye test, a few weeks ago, she asked about ready made reading glasses. She was told that they would be fine for short periods but should wear prescription glasses for longer periods because of the slight difference between each eye. She uses a cheap pair of ready made glasses if she is holding her baby daughter because her daughter likes to try to grab glasses and managed to break her previous pair of prescription glasses! I wanted to cuddle my friend's baby so I gave my glasses to Gemma for safe keeping.(Neither Gemma or I want kids, either adopted or via a sperm donor and pregnancy, but other people's kids are fine for short periods especially when they are as cute as this friend's baby) </p><p>My friend's glasses looked around +1 or +1.50 (she didn't say and I didn't ask).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;28 Sep 2017, 11:37</p><p>Walked to my car after a meeting this late afternoon, the pavement next a cobblestone street with tram tracks imbedded. I saw how a young woman tried to cross the tracks while riding her bike, but her front wheel got stuck, and she fell off her bike. Luckily she didn't really hurt herself, and there were no cars or trams at that very moment. I helped her to get up and recover her bike, satchel, and handbag together with another pedestrian. </p><p> </p><p>While doing so, I also noticed a pair of bright red glasses on the street next to her bike. I picked them up and handed them back to her. She took them and was very thankful they were not broken (probably because the frames were of a thicker plastic, and I guess polycarbonate lenses). She told us she hadn't even noticed she had lost them while falling. Indeed, the lenses didn't seem to have very strong prescription, but she put them on again before resuming her ride.</p><p></p><hr>

I don't know whether it is just because we notice these things more but I have a feeling there are more full time low plus wearers than there used to be (probably because we all live on our phones these days).  </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if opticians (the ones that actually give proper guidance that is) have started to change their advice. It probably makes sense for a teenager who is a little bit longsighted and lives the whole of his/her life through their phone just to leave their specs on rather than taking them on and off like a yoyo. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2017, 05:19</p><p>I was in town on Saturday and I saw a girl, who was probably late teens or very early 20s, wearing some dark plastic frames that I initially presumed were fake but turned out not to be. From what I could work out she had just been to the opticians to pick up her glasses and she had just met up with the bunch of friends that she was with when I saw her. Her friends were very complimentary and also wanted to try the glasses on. One of her friends said she felt dizzy with the glasses on, another just said everything was blurry with them on and another noticed that they magnified things like her mum's reading glasses did but a bit more. That last friend handed the glasses back to their owner asking if they were reading glasses. The original girl said she it was recommended that she wore them all the time. Unfortunately I couldn't get to hear any more of what they were saying as they moved off but I did manage to get a quick look at the new glasses wearer as the group walked past me. It was difficult to work out how strong her prescription was but I would guess between +1 and +2. I couldn't tell if there was any astigmatism or prism correction. </p><p>A regular sighting for me has changed her look. There's a woman I quite often see waiting at a bus stop as I walk to school. Before her new look she reminded me of the singer Carly Rae Jepson with glasses (Here's a pic of CRJ with glasses on <a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/h-YRJR_q_b4/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.ytimg.com/vi/h-YRJR_q_b4/maxresdefault.jpg</a> ) The woman has an attractive smiley face and used to have a similar low straight fringe to CRJ and her glasses were similar to the ones in the photo. The woman has a new haircut which looks very nice on her. The fringe has gone and she has new glasses. Thanks to the new haircut and the new larger glasses I saw that she has a mild minus prescription. It might be minus with astigmatism or just astigmatism correction because of the distortion I can see behind her through her glasses. We always say hello to each other even though we don't know each other so I have been able to get a few good looks. Her old glasses and hair style prevented me getting a look to see what sort of prescription she had so I can't compare her old and new prescriptions.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus Tony</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2017, 12:52</p><p>Continued from previous post... </p><p> </p><p>Although I was running out of time, I walked in that direction and although I didn't hear everything it was obvious that she was talking to whoever had been with her when she had her eye test and picked the frames. It also became clear that the dispenser who had fitted her glasses was not the same person who had served her when she picked her frames. I've tried to recall as much of the one-sided conversation as I can although it was obvious that whoever was on the other end of the phone was not filling her with confidence. I don't know but suspect it may have been her mother... </p><p> </p><p>"Honestly she was lovely...said I'd picked well. The only thing is... I'm not allowed to take them off... except in bed or the shower. Did you know that? I don't remember them saying anything about that before"  </p><p>pause while the other person replied...  </p><p>"What? No. I'm serious. That's what she said. Straight away when I get up" ...  </p><p>"Yeah it was a bit of a shocker but she looked like she knew what she was on about"... </p><p>"Yeah she was. I do like how they look. She said glasses were an upgrade."... </p><p>"I think so. I don't think it works like that"... </p><p>"Yeah, every day."... </p><p>"All day, yeah permanent"... </p><p>"Heavy? Not really. Things look a bit bigger. Good like"... </p><p>"Yeah that's the point isn't it"... </p><p>"A bit, yeah but its alright"... </p><p>[At this point she stubbed out her cigarette and immediately reached into her bag to get another one and carried on talking...] </p><p>"Yeah, hang on I'm just lighting a ciggie"... </p><p>"Second one, well I'm you know. What? Yeah well its still quite a big thing. A change like."... </p><p>"Yeah I know. Not now though. Don't go on"... </p><p>"What? Not that many really" </p><p>"Course its OK. What have fags got to do with glasses?"... </p><p> </p><p>[Not that I would have said anything anyway it occurred to me that now was not the time for a newly bespectacled and increasingly nervous young woman to hear about the potential effects of long term smoking on the eyes] </p><p> </p><p>"Sarah's always had glasses and she smokes way more than I do...what? and Bethan and Kasia too. Yeah you know the Polish girl at work"... </p><p>"I don't think smoking has anything to do with it. Leave it"... </p><p>"Beth's 18 now. I don't know but she's had glasses since she was little" </p><p>"What? I don't know. About the same time as me probably. I have no idea if her mother knows. It's up to her isn't it?".... </p><p>"Yeah, they wear theirs all the time too. At least I'm pretty sure they do. I don't remember seeing them not wearing them "... </p><p>"Yeah its just the way it is. I'll just have to get used to it. What?"... </p><p>"Yeah she wears glasses too. Eh? No she doesn't smoke. Barry? No he doesn't smoke either."... </p><p>"See it has nothing to do with it. Anyway I've got to go and walk round for a bit to make sure everything's all right with the glasses"... </p><p>"Yes of course I've got them on. That's what it means"... </p><p>"Yes, immediately. Obviously. Right look I'll see you later"... </p><p>"Ha bloody ha. I've got to do this"... </p><p>"Yes from today. Look I'll see you later" </p><p> </p><p>[At this moment, the dispenser and a male colleague walked out of the opticians but went in opposite directions, the dispenser moving purposefully in the direction of her recent customer, smiling broadly with an unlit cigarette in her hand] </p><p> </p><p>Dispenser "Oh hello again. Everything ok?" </p><p>Woman "Yes fine I'm just getting used to things. Sorry I probably shouldn't be smoking should I?" </p><p>Dispenser "Well should any of us really?  but when I saw you standing here I knew Id be able to ask you for a light. I loaned my lighter to a colleague and she isnt back from lunch" </p><p>Woman "Oh yes of course. I didnt think youd be a smoker. It probably isnt good for the eyes is it </p><p>Dispenser Well it probably isnt good full stop but it isnt why we need to wear glasses just in case thats what youre thinking. Im just going to get a coffee. You can join me if you like </p><p>Woman Yes why not </p><p>Dispenser Great. Then we can go back the shop and make sure everything is OK with those lovely new glasses of yours.  </p><p> </p><p>And that was the last I saw of them as they headed off to Costa Coffee puffing away. Although I am a non-smoker and generally disapprove of smoking it occurred to me that the cheerful dispenser and her customers shared habit was a handy coincidence. After having her confidence in wearing glasses somewhat eroded by whoever was on the phone I have no doubt that by the time theyd finished their coffee the woman would be much more confident in her new eyewear and almost certain to follow the dispensers wise advice to wear her glasses full time. If there were more enthusiastic people like her working at the retail end of the optical profession I cant help thinking there might well be more people who should be wearing specs actually wearing specs! I shall definitely call in for a browse next time Im in that town.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus Tony</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2017, 12:21</p><p>The second event that I mentioned in my previous post occurred while I was browsing frames in an optician one lunchtime while I was killing time on my way to a work meeting. I've not mentioned the names of the main protagonists involved, just in case, although I've named those mentioned in passing otherwise it wouldn't make sense. </p><p> </p><p>A young woman of about 20ish was sitting waiting to receive what I took to be her first glasses as she wasn't wearing any. The dispenser who was probably in her late 20s and wearing very stylish blue acetate specs came to sit down opposite her carrying a tray containing the woman's new glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>Their interaction started in a very unusual way. The dispenser asked the woman what her normal morning routine was. She replied somewhat sheepishly that she usually started with a mug of coffee and a cigarette before going to the bathroom. The dispenser replied "OK we're going to need to make a little change from now on. First thing you need to do every morning, the very first, before you have your caffeine and nicotine is put your glasses on and after that leave them on except when you are in the shower or swimming. Its very important" The woman laughed nervously but did not make any protest and the dispenser then went through the ritual of polishing the lenses before fitting the frames. Then she said, "OK take a look in the mirror before we upgrade to the new you" The dispenser then handed the glasses to the woman who put them straight on and looked again in the mirror. I noticed that the prescription was a mild plus, maybe +1.50 or so and the frames were black plastic with metal sides. </p><p> </p><p>The dispenser continued "You look fantastic don't you think. Your face was made for those glasses" The woman who now had a beaming smile asked her if she really thought so and the dispenser replied that she did before adding "You know it is really important for girls like us who need our glasses all day to look great and you've made an excellent choice. Now how is your vision?"  </p><p> </p><p>The woman replied that it was generally fine before commenting that things in the distance weren't 100% sharp (as you'd probably expect). The dispenser gave the standard explanation about getting used to the prescription for a few days and muscles relaxing, not losing a further opportunity to remind her not to take her glasses off. She then checked the fit and made a few adjustments and suggested to the woman that she should go for a walk around for an hour and if possible she should return to check that everything was ok. The woman said that was OK and she left the shop. The dispenser then walked through the shop past me and for the first time I got a good look at her own lenses which were also plus but probably about double the prescription of the ones she had just dispensed. I must admit that as someone who appreciates long sighted ladies it was a very pleasant experience all round. </p><p> </p><p>I thought the dispenser's unorthodox and very friendly style worked really well. She used the perfect tone of voice so that everything she said sounded like confidential advice between a couple of close friends. Not once did the woman who was getting the glasses make any comment or complaint about the suggestion that she should be wearing them all the time... which brings me to the next stage of this happy tale of good customer service. </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately I had to leave the shop as it was nearly time for my meeting but as I did I noticed the newly bespectacled customer standing a little up the road already half way through smoking a cigarette and talking on her mobile. My first thought was "well she's still wearing them so that is a good start" It then occurred to me that the clever dispenser hadn't given the woman her glasses case (another good move I thought because if the glasses stay on for the first hour...).  </p><p> </p><p>To be continued...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus Tony</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2017, 09:43</p><p>Carrie and Soundampt </p><p> </p><p>It is certainly good news that Danielle is moving towards constant wear. It is interesting how views differ about when a plus prescription should be worn full time. Personally I think that, as an adult, if a plus prescription gives you clear vision at all distances glasses should be worn full time.   </p><p> </p><p>When I was doing research a little while ago I discovered that broadly the consensus seemed to be that pre-teens with +3.25 and teens with +2.25 or more should be prescribed glasses for full time wear (exceptions being where the child also has astigmatism, alignment issues, potential amblyopia etc. where lower thresholds would apply). However there seems to be very little guidance about adults with low hyperopia who are not presbyopic and the approach seems to vary wildly between different countries. In fact it probably varies wildly depending upon your eye doctor and who dispenses your glasses and the information that you are given at the time your glasses are dispensed. Fortunately when I first got glasses the dispenser was very clear that it was a distance prescription for general wear rather than reading glasses and although I was not told to wear them all the time I did anyway and when I had my second test it was suggested that I should (even though my prescription hadn't changed). </p><p> </p><p>Two things recently reinforced my view that slightly long sighted adults benefit from full time glasses. I was at a social event a few weeks ago where I was introduced to a friend of a friend who is an Optometrist. She was a lady in her mid 30s who was wearing glasses with a mild prescription (no more than +2). After a while we got on to talking about glasses and I asked her what criteria she used to advise people about when to wear their specs. She told me that for adults with hyperopia she always explained that the prescription was for all distances and that usually if the patient had more than +1.00 she would encourage full time wear just as she would with short sighted people. She also mentioned how irritating it is when patients complain of headaches at their eye tests when they arrive not wearing the glasses that they have previously been prescribed. I was really encouraged by her attitude and the fact that unlike so many British optometrists she actually tells her patients how they should be using their glasses. Although her practice is some distance from my home I am tempted to go to her for my next eye test which is due at the end of the month. </p><p> </p><p>I'll talk about the second incident in another post. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2017, 12:44</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Oops! I was a bit off in my thinking that Danielle and you had about the same prescription. Her glasses are considerably weaker than yours. But still enough that she needs to be wearing her glasses full time. Her Facebook post really says it all. Yes when her glasses were weaker and her eyes were stronger she was able to see pretty well without her glasses except for reading and while at work. But her eyes were still changing and she was needing her glasses more and more often and her glasses got a little stronger as well. It wasn't that long ago that she was still able to drive without glasses but she admittedly needs her glasses to drive now as well as watching TV It was bound to happen because her eye were getting more and more used to seeing with her glasses on. Just by wearing them at work was making a big difference in her need for glasses. I'm sure at work she wasn't taking her glasses off every tiem she looked up from doing close work to see something in the distance. At first when she did that things were slightly blurry for her and out of focus. B ut the more she wore her glasses the clearer everything started to get with her glasses on. Now since she was able to distances with her glasses she stopped taking them off while at work because it was easier to just keep them on all day at work. But after wearing her glasses for 8 - 10 hours a day at work taking her glasses off to drive home was far more difficult because her eyes were fully adjusted to not only seeing things close up at work but also things at a distance as well.No wonder she was told to start wearing her glasses for driving.She knows she now needs her glasses to drive because she can't see well enough anymore without them to drive safely. I'm just glad that she isn't in denial. Her worst fears are now true she is now dependent on her glasses to see clearly. You have always wanted Danielle to wear her glasses full time. I don't think you will see Danielle without her glasses anymore except she takes them off to clean them. She seems to be reluctantly accepting that she can't see well enough without glasses anymore. I have a feeling Vickie is thrilled that her mate is now wearing glasses full time because we know Vickie has a glasses fetish as much as you if not more.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;01 Sep 2017, 17:31</p><p>Soundmanpt - Danielle's prescription is around +2.00 with no astigmatism and my prescription is L+3.25 and R+3.75 and -0.50 L&amp;R; for astigmatism, so a bit stronger than Danielle's. </p><p>One of the comments on Danielle's Facebook post asked her about her eyesight including if she is Long Sighted or Short Sighted. Danielle replied "I am long sighted. I used to only need glasses for reading and work but then I found I needed them for driving and watching tv. I have to admit that putting my glasses on does making everything at all distances sharper (obviously much more noticeable close up). Currently my eyes ache slightly if I don't have my glasses on. As I said, I hope it's just temporary but in the back of my mind I'm thinking it might not be."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;31 Aug 2017, 13:31</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I was just about to head out to clean my garage when I saw your post. So of course I am looking for every reason possible to avoid doing that.  </p><p>Glad to hear that your work colleague got nicer looking glasses. Nice to her that she is considering wearing her glasses more often. Maybe she has gotten enough complements on her looks wearing glasses to cause her to think about it more? It does sound like her new glasses must be fairly close to your manager's glasses she was borrowing.  </p><p>I think Danielle has finally decided that she really can't see well enough anymore to go without glasses or contacts. Her eyes get tired because without her glasses she is straining constantly to see anything. Now that her eyes are fully adjusted to her glasses she knows that when she takes her glasses off now everything is more blurry than it was before.  If she has been wearing her glasses as she says "constantly for the past few weeks" she may not want to admit it but she is now dependent on her glasses even though that was what she didn't want to happen to her. it won't be a temporary situation for her. If I recall you and her have about the same prescription so I know you consider yourself dependent on your glasses. So she needs her glasses as much as you need yours and you know how much you need your glasses. She needs a kind word from a friend. Since she posted that on Facebook you might want to console her by letting her know how attractive she is wearing glasses and that wearing glasses really isn't a bad thing at all.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;31 Aug 2017, 11:16</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p>I've been busy too!&#128512; To answer your question her new glasses are better. She got nicer ones as she has to wear them instead of her contacts for a few weeks. She said she actually likes how she looks in them so might not wear her contacts as much. Her glasses were the same prescription as her contacts. She first got glasses for for distances at about 15. She got contacts a couple of years later when her prescription went up. She hadn't realised her sight had changed so much since then. She doesn't know her new prescription but thinks it must be close to the prescription in our manager's computer glasses as they felt similar to look through at first but she is used to them now. </p><p> </p><p>My friend Danielle has been wearing her glasses every time I have seen her recently but I haven't said anything to her. Yesterday on her Facebook page she wrote "Been wearing my glasses constantly for the last few weeks as it's the only way to relieve tired eyes. I blame working too hard for the tired eyes. Hopefully it's a temporary situation!" So it looks like she has gone full time, for now anyway. I would guess that she is annoyed by this and would avoid wearing her glasses if she could.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Aug 2017, 17:09</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I intended to comment to you and got busy and totally forgot. Anyway I know you said that her previous glasses were "rather basic" and you didn't think they did anything for her. So does her new glasses look any better or still not a good look for her? You said her new glasses are noticeably stronger than her previous glasses. If she's like most she likely only upgrades her contacts every year since she normally only wears contacts and doesn't bother upgrading her glasses. So her glasses could be 2 or 3 prescriptions weaker than her contacts. You should maybe tell her about ordering her glasses on line. She might appreciate that. Besides you know you love getting into a conversation about glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2017, 23:15</p><p>My colleague that had the contact lens problem a couple of weeks ago has got some new glasses now. I could tell just by looking that the prescription was stronger than her old glasses. She said they were stronger and she's still getting used to them as everything is super HD clear. Her prescription was "bumped up quite a bit" but can't remember it. She was advised to stick to glasses for a bit longer to ensure her eye has healed fully and to get used to the new prescription. Her new glasses look to be a similar prescription to our manager's glasses that she leant my colleague on the day of the contact problem.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NNVisitor</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2017, 23:50</p><p>281 </p><p> </p><p>Interesting observations. Some people have a natural tendency to be introverted and shy. Introverts usually don't talk about their feelings and if wearing glasses say nothing about them. This is especially true if their glasses are strong. </p><p> </p><p>Extroverted girls often pick brighter colored more stylish and more noticeable clothes. They are more likely to wear revealing tops and sexy clothes. Some wear very stylish glasses. They are more likely to talk about their glasses or even their vision. If they are self conscious about wearing glasses or wearing thick glasses then very likely wearing contact lenses. </p><p> </p><p>Being self conscious about wearing strong glasses has more to do about their personality and past experiences such as mean comments or teasing about their glasses. This applies no matter what their race is. </p><p> </p><p>In the Chinese community many people have myopia thus many glasses wearers. Among Caucasians in some families everyone or most of them wear glasses. This usually makes wearing glasses quite normal and acceptable. </p><p> </p><p>I've noticed in the Chinese and Korean communities sometimes there are groups of young people all wearing black plastic frames. A lot of other young Chinese particularly young women wearing very stylish expensive eyeglass frames of different colors or multi coloured. </p><p> </p><p>Among Caucasian young women and girls some wear bright colored frames. Usually plastic ones. Brown is also a popular color both among Chinese women and even more popular among Caucasian young women plastic frames of course. Also some with metal frames but most prefer plastic or are just wearing contact lenses. </p><p> </p><p>Anything above -10 to -12 myopia correction is a very rare sighting. I guess most with very strong glasses are self conscious and wearing contact lenses. That's true no matter what race they are. </p><p> </p><p>I am an introvert with a strong prescription so my glasses frames are more subdued. I'd never ever wear bright colored frames. Typically when out of my home I'm wearing contact lenses. Just once in a while I go out wearing my glasses. At home sure I'll wear my glasses a lot. I think a lot of people are like me in this respect.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>281</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2017, 13:06</p><p>Girls in their twenties wearing corrective glasses are more commonly found in those "small, local offices". By more common, we can expect entering the front office with a few strong glasses wearers meeting you, the several staff at front office has age not necessarily in the twenties, but they would give you an idea, even the front line girl wears glasses. Usually the front line girls are more "attractive" for normal people. But it was the back office we can find some "beasts" for normal people, that was the paradise of abnormal body shapes, such as obese or lack of body curve , also the extreme glasses loving girls who are usually wearing frames that are much outdated for current trend. Even if there was revival of fashion you can tell their glasses frames that have old metal joints or screws, yellowed nose pads, or rather worn out frames. </p><p> </p><p> The most typical history of these girls was, grew up as obedient child,  as a teen they are typically followers who are often shy, family centered, tend to be conservative</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>281</b>&nbsp;20 Aug 2017, 06:58</p><p>NNVisitor </p><p> </p><p>There are girls who are confident for wearing less than 2 or 3 diopters , but finding the look of strong glasses "not desirable" . Such girls can be at 3 diopters at age 15 , maybe 8 diopters at age 20, 10 diopters at age 22 . Despite their reluctance, they either wear contact lenses or reluctantly wearing glasses. They also feel disappointed for the average yearly 1 diopter increase of prescription. Feeling disppointed, can be shy to talk about their change, can be wearing lower rx glasses for example needing minus 10 but wearing minus 8 .</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Aug 2017, 09:28</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Pretty sure your colleague had a "burr" or a small rip in her contact that she didn't notice because it is usually too small to see. It could have been dirt or something could have blown in her eye and got under her lens but not as likely. I'm sure when she was in pain because a scratched cornea with her lens pushing on it really hurts. Each time she blinked her eye had to be quite painful. After this I am surprised she is even planning on wearing contacts again. You mentioned that she wears a bit too much makeup, actually you said "loads of makeup" So she must wear more than enough eye makeup as well? That isn't a good idea if she wants to continue wearing contacts. Sometimes mascara can get brittle and beak off and that can even get under her lenses. She needs to decide which she wants more. All the makeup or her contacts. If she wants to continue with the makeup then she needs to be wearing glasses. She should get her new glasses in a few days and maybe if she picked out a really nice pair of glasses that really suits her and she wears them for several weeks she may find that those boys are still chasing her even with her wearing glasses she may forget about wearing contacts. You say she is a sweet girl maybe when she gets her new glasses you should complement her on how good she looks wearing glasses. Maybe a little extra self confidence will help her decide to continue wearing her glasses.  </p><p>Sounds like you girls had a great weekend together. Sorry that you were banned from the kitchen. I also love pizza so I would have been banned as well. Like you say no surprise that Vicky was wearing her glasses. It would only be news if she wasn't wearing her glasses. But I am sure you were surprised that Danielle came wearing her glasses and more surprised that she never took them off except to change to her prescription sunglasses. It has taken a long while but it appears that Danielle has finally given into the fact that she needs to wear her glasses full time now. You know that once she had to start wearing her glasses to drive that meant that her distance vision was no longer perfect or she wouldn't have been told that she needed to start wearing them when driving. Her glasses are only slightly weaker than your glasses I think. So you know that she can't see much better than you can without your glasses. And you have no desire to go without your glasses. It was probably just as well that nothing was said about glasses. I have a feeling that Vicky loves seeing Danielle wearing glasses since we both know she has a glasses fetish.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;07 Aug 2017, 14:15</p><p>My colleague who had the contact lens problem last week was at work today. She was wearing her glasses again. She said her optician said she has a tiny scratch on her eye and mustn't wear contacts until it's healed. She also needs a slightly stronger prescription. She's ordered new glasses but won't get new contacts until her eye is healed. She's not unattractive, in fact the younger boys at work think she's great, but she's not my type - loads of makeup. I don't like to use the word but I would say she was a bit tarty. Hopefully she'll grow out of it. She is a sweet girl. Looks like she'll be wearing glasses for the next few weeks. </p><p>Danielle and Vicky came over to ours on Saturday afternoon and stayed until Sunday afternoon. Plenty of food for all of us. (I was even banned from the kitchen on Saturday until our guests arrived in case I ate any more pizza before they arrived!) Of course Vicky was wearing her glasses but what was unexpected was Danielle wearing her glasses the whole time apart from when she was wearing her prescription sunglasses. All of us had prescription sunglasses on for a while on both days. Unfortunately there was no discussion or even mention about glasses. It is VERY unusual for Danielle to wear her glasses so much at a weekend. I don't know if she has finally gone full time or just felt she needed to wear her glasses all day both days.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2017, 06:41</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I honestly don't know all that much about contact lenses and the various types either. The daily lenses I know require far less care than the bi-weekly ones and monthly ones. But I would think you still need moistening drops of some type if your eyes get dry or you need to remove or replace your lens for any reason. I'm not sure how good the eye wash in first aid boxes work with contact lenses. Maybe better than tap water? If she came into work the next day wearing her glasses and her eye was still red and sore looking I think she most likely had a small rip or burr on the edge of lens when she put it on that morning and it scratched her cornea a little bit. A small rip or burr is hardly noticeable but can be very painful. She maybe wearing glasses for a few days depending on how long her eye needs to heal. For someone that loves seeing other young ladies wearing glasses you clearly weren't very impressed with how her glasses looked on her. Is she not very attractive or is it just that her glasses don't suit her very well? So I have a feeling, since I know you have stated several times how nice your manager looks wearing glasses you must have thought that she looked better wearing your managers glasses than her own glasses? If your managers glasses are -3.00 something and your colleague's glasses are only -2.25 her eyes were considerably over corrected for the day. But depending on how long she has had her current glasses they could be on the weak side by now. But even if she needs an increase it probably wouldn't be that much. Her eyes just adjusted to your manager's glasses and she was enjoying the over correction. I'm sure she was seeing everything razor sharp clarity. By the time she got home that evening and put on her own glasses i'm sure her glasses seemed too weak for her eyes and she would have rather kept wearing the borrowed glasses. I think she was tempted to take your manager's offer to borrow her glasses for the weekend. Probably a good idea for her to get her eye checked out just to make sure there is no permanent damage to her eye. I would suspect that she will be told not wear contacts for several days or more. Depending on how long it has been since her last eye exam will depend on how much if any increase she might need in her glasses and contacts.  </p><p>So nice to hear that your having a girls weekend. I assume since there will be drinks they will be spending at least one night at your place? It will be interesting to hear how much Danielle will be wearing her glasses if at all. Of course Vicky we know will have her glasses on constantly except when she goes to bed maybe. I of course hope that at some point the topic of glasses comes up. Vicky has had her current glasses for a while now i wonder if she is considering getting her eyes checked anytime soon? Like you she has a glasses fetish so she probably enjoys getting her  eyes tested as much as picking out new glasses.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2017, 13:38</p><p>I'm not sure how long my colleague has been wearing contacts. She possibly did have some solution with her but I didn't go with her when she went to wash the contact and her eye. Do you need solution for daily disposable lenses? I don't know the type of lenses she has.  </p><p>She said she rinsed her eye with eye wash from the first aid box that someone gave her when she was in the staff toilet and then again at home with some Optrex eye wash. </p><p>She came to work the next day wearing glasses because her eye was still sore. It looked a bit red as well. Her glasses were ok, fairly basic. Didn't really do much for her. She said she hardly wears them as they are just a back up for when she isn't wearing contacts but stupidly left them at home the first time she gets something in her eye! </p><p>She gave back our manager's glasses that she borrowed and asked her what the prescription was in them as she could see really well with them. Our manager said they were -3.something. My colleague said she probably needs a new prescription as she could see clearer with the manager's glasses than her own glasses which are the same prescription as her contacts, although the manager's glasses did feel slightly too strong but maybe that was because she wasn't used to them. She said she checked her contacts box to see what her prescription is and it's -2.25, same in both eyes. Our manager said she could borrow the glasses again over the weekend but my colleague thanked her and said that although she is tempted she will stick with her own glasses. She also said she had managed to get an opticians appointment on Saturday to check the eye and to have a sight test. </p><p>I've got a busy weekend ahead with Danielle and Vicky coming over. We'll try not to disturb the neighbours but we do tend to get a bit loud sometimes when we are all together and have had a few drinkies! My lovely Gemma is making food for the weekend and has now banned me from the kitchen for the rest of the night because I kept eating pieces of the home made pizza that is for all of us tomorrow! I took a couple of pieces when her back was turned and the next time I took some she caught me red handed even though her glasses were steamed up from when she had just checked on something in the oven. If she catches me again I'll be sleeping on the sofa tonight! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2017, 08:25</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I wonder how new your colleague is to wearing contacts? It seems like she may have only got them recently other wise he would have had a small bottle of solution in her bag just in case something were to get in her eye or under a lens. Using tap water isn't what you want to do because tap water isn't safe to use. Like "NNVisitor" said by the time she got to work her eye was already irritated which meant her lens was still uncomfortable to wear. Also it's possible that she may have accidentally caused a small tear or nic on the edge of her lens when she was putting it on. That can be very painful as well. So was she back wearing her contacts the next day? If so then it was probably only something on her lens. By wearing your manager's glasses all day was the best thing she could have done. That allowed her eye to recover. Even with the glasses being slightly stronger than what she needs i'm sure her eyes were able to make the adjustment quite easily. Actually i'm sure her eyes enjoyed being over corrected.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NNVisitor</b>&nbsp;02 Aug 2017, 23:16</p><p>Carrie </p><p> </p><p>As a contact lens wearer I understand what happenned. She got some dust particle stuck under her contact lens. It caused pain but because she was on her way to work she may have put up with it for 10-30 minutes waiting to use the washroom at work to take it out. Pain and probably corneal swelling resulted.  </p><p> </p><p>This event reminds me of one from many years ago when I worked for a stock brokerage company. Each morning two of us would go to the bank safe and open a large safety deposit box to file and take out stock certificates. A young lady about 23 years olds and myself were doing that duty together for a week each day. She came to work one day and was holding papers closer to her eyes than normal. When asked about it she said she couldn't wear her contact lenses that day. The supervisor said well don't you have glasses. Her reply was that she threw her glasses out. A strange reply but I thought then and still do that she absolutely would not wear glasses in public or at work. She still had to go down to the bank safe with me that day. We had the large metal drawer open and she had to look close to see. She bent down one time and hit her forehead on the metal door by accident all because she had no contacts in nor glasses to see clearly with. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;02 Aug 2017, 15:49</p><p>A colleague at work had major contact lens problems this morning. She had only just got in when she complained of discomfort in one eye. She said a bit of dust had probably got under her contact (I didn't know that she wore contacts). She went to the staff toilets to wash the lens and her eye but her eye was still uncomfortable. She didn't have any spare lenses or her glasses with her but was prepared to go the whole day with just one lens in. Our manager had a good idea. She asked my colleague if she she knew her prescription. My colleague said she wasn't entirely sure but knew she was short sighted. Earlier this year our manager bought herself some glasses with a weaker prescription than her regular glasses to wear when she is on the computer at work. She finds these more comfortable to wear for long periods at the computer than her regular glasses which are no-line bifocals. Our manager suggested that my colleague borrowed these glasses rather than trying to get around with one contact. My colleague was very grateful and removed her other contact and put the glasses on. She said that they seemed stronger than her contacts but not too strong. She wore them for the rest of the day and was going to give them back to our manager at the end of her shift but our manager said she could keep them until tomorrow so she could see properly to get home. </p><p>My colleague is about 18 or 19 and is a student on summer break. I don't work with her very often as she usually does evenings and weekends.</p><p></p><hr>

I would have written about her from the coffee shop but as the free wifi was not encrypted and her male friend looked like he could without effort split me in two I decided to write about her from elsewhere.

As I was watching I saw the flash of light off a girls glasses in the distance, as she came nearer she  looked towards us and her dark eyes were magnified enormously.   She was handing out leaflets.  Looking right down at the leaflets then up at the people lining the route offering them out.  She was wearing extremely short cut off jeans with a few threads hanging down her shapely legs and a short sleeveless top showing her slim figure and tummy.   Her whole body was beautifully tanned.   I couldn't help looking even though I was with my wife and daughter.   As she approached her eyes were hidden behind the lenses the top of which showed a big chunk ground back to the frame.   They bulged out wonderfully.   She looked up and stared straight at me.   Perhaps she noticed my similar glasses?   I said thanks as I took the leaflet and she looked right down again to see the ground in front of her feet before walking off and looking up again at the crowd.

Not sure if that is what they call it in the UK but that is what it is called in the U.S. But still every young lady enjoys being complemented. And for you being told how good you look wearing glasses was the perfect complement for a girl that loves wearing glasses as much as you do. Even better he commented on how he liked seeing your eyes slightly magnified behind your lenses. It didn't hurt that this came from what you described as a "good looking" man. If Gemma had never come into your life I think you might have accepted his offer to go for a drink with him. You could be right that he has a thing for girls wearing glasses. So you  thanked him, showed him a picture of Gemma and told him this is the person you're in a relationship with. Nice that he found Gemma to be pretty and he again complemented both you and Gemma when he said "another bespectacled beauty" But i'm sure that really made your day. I know how much you love wearing your glasses and i'm sure sure you feel very pretty wearing glasses but having a total stranger tell you how good you look wearing glasses confirms it.          </p><p>Nice to hear from you.

He then said I looked good with glasses and liked how the lenses slightly magnified my eyes. He made some other very complimentary remarks about me and then asked me if I would like to go for a drink with him. Obviously I explained that I couldn't go on a date with him but thanked him for his lovely comments which had really made my day. I think he was in to girls with glasses by the way he looked at me.

<p><b>NNVisitor</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2017, 23:20</p><p>I was taking a bus ride today on a limited stop express bus. One or two stops after I got on five young ladies who looked 20-21 years old got on. All dressed summery wearing shorts as it was hot today. Three sat accross from men. One wore nice rectangular black glasses which really suited her. She's wearing mild minus lenses in her glasses. Perpendicular to me one of them wore large rectangular glasses which I guessed were -4 or maybe -5. The lenses protruded outside the frame on the backside. They were multicolored. Next to me sat one of the young ladies wearing dark brown frames. A bit plainer looking than the other two had on. Her prescription was probably near -2. She was the hardest to observe as I was very discreet and did not want to draw their attention. All three with the glasses did not have antireflection coating. They were all talking away when one of the two not wearing glasses noticed an advert above me for discount contact lenses. Then her and the other not wearing glasses were discussing the add. Three out of five wearing glasses as glasses seem to be quite popular these days with young women.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jim H</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2017, 19:25</p><p>Over the Canada day long weekend, I attended a pool party that was catered.  One of our friends got glasses with a low minus and looked very nice walking around in her swimsuit with her specs on, but took them off to go swimming.  My wife kept her glasses on in the pool while holding our daughter, and placed them on the pool edge to go for a proper swim but promptly put them back on after.  There were two very nice looking women in their early 50's (short brunette and a taller blonde) both with reading glasses that were constantly on and off, all while pool side.  One of the servers was a very pretty petite and tanned mid 20's with long hombre hair, wearing a black sleeveless shirt, black skirt and black wedge heels.  Here glasses were a metal half frames with the arms high on the temples and was about -6.  Very fun time, but had to be careful with all the nice gwgs and me just in swim shorts!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2017, 14:49</p><p>I needed to change my mobile's SIM card today, so went to a phone shop over lunch time, took a ticket and sat down waiting for my turn. A few minutes later a lady entered the shop, and took the seat next to me. Professional attire, nice heels, and wearing very flashy glasses: thin neon-pink plastic frames, no designer label, and lenses with visible power rings. </p><p> </p><p>She took her iPhone and started reading her mails. But had trouble doing so, pushed the glasses up her head, and it looked like she could read more easily without her glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>Five minutes on she sighed deeply and complained to me about the waiting time. I agreed, and took the opportunity to compliment her about her bold choice of frames which I thought fitted very well with her blonde hair color. She thanked me, and explained she only dared to pick the pink frames as a back-up because she could do so as part of a "1+1 free" sales action at her optician. She told me her regular frames were classical dark frames, but those were now with the optician for a new prescription, which was why she had to use the pink ones. She had never worn those before to the office but had received many compliments already this morning and yesterday. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brett </b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2017, 19:01</p><p>Had an interesting sighting, a work friend of ours that neither my wife or I knew wore contacts. She is about 35, into fitness/running and kind of I don't want to say vain, but much more concerned about her appearance than a lot of folks. Ive worked around her for a dozen years almost and never seen her glasses. &nbsp; </p><p> </p><p>We went to her house Sunday and she answered wearing what were about -8 glasses, typical black ray bans didn't seem the lenses were the highest index (surprising for her unless she never planned on being seen in them). She seemed kinda apprehensive about them, butsaid immediately her son just got glasses and she was trying to be supportive. Hes about 9 and was there wearing his new glasses. &nbsp;She told us he's a -2 and needs to wear full-time. Really positive about glasses in front of him and I thought that was really cool. My wife also told him that she loves hers and has never even tried contacts. He seemed comfortable wearing his. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Then he left to play and she told us she doesn't want him to follow her path: got glasses as a kid, never hardly wore them, contacts all the time since a teen, eyes got worse/worse but embarrassed to be in public with thicker glasses and can't do lasik from overwearing contacts and thinning corneas. But has been wearing glasses almost exclusively at home for a week for her son and her words "acting as normal as possible". We again told her she looked good and was doing something very special for her son. </p><p> </p><p>She also casually mentioned that she hates reading for any length of time with the her glasses because of stuff being smaller and asked half joking how long it took my wife to get used to bifocals. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2017, 09:54</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Sorry to hear that you're having another boring day. But at least you have "eyescene" to make time pass.  </p><p>I'm sure you're probably right that Danielle for some reason thinks going without her glasses or contacts is keeping her from being completely dependent on vision correction. But really all she is doing is straining her eyes unnecessarily. Like you say once you get to the point where you need your glasses for distances as well as for reading that is when you really need to start wearing your glasses full time. When she was told that she needs to start wearing her glasses when she drives it was because her eyes are no longer able to focus at a distance anymore. So even though they only used driving as the main point they were really telling her that she can't see distances very well anymore without her glasses meaning she needs her glasses for everything from going to concerts, sporting events, the movies, and even watching TV at home. As far as her inability to read without her glasses I don't know if it is maybe due to her being a bit older than you or if it is because of the type of work she does. Her job involves a lot of detailed close work which has no doubt contributed to her need for glasses.  </p><p>I didn't remember when or for what you wore the contacts for but I just remembered that you had contacts and I didn't think you wore them very often. I can see where working out at the gym would be better wearing contacts rather than glasses for the very reason you mentioned. Honestly the fact that you wore contacts at all surprised me because you were so happy to be a glasses wearing young lady. Funny once you get used to wearing glasses i'm sure you did feel a bit naked without your glasses being on your nose. So getting the strap solved the problem of your glasses sliding down your nose and you were more happy as well.  </p><p>I also read the stories in "Vision and Spex" I like Zennia's stories even though I am as you know a straight man. I really liked the one she wrote about the band and the girl singer. I enjoyed it because of all my days working with a band which featured several different girl singers over the years. Much of what she wrote about the way bands get along on the road is so very true. I personally enjoy the stories by "nic" I like that his characters seem very real and the prescriptions of the characters is very realistic and not off the charts.  </p><p>So have fun at work.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2017, 04:26</p><p>I'm glad my daft joke amused a few people. </p><p>I think Danielle just likes to prove to herself that she isn't completely dependent on glasses or contacts which is why she doesn't wear them when she feels she doesn't need to. I would have thought that when you get to the point that you need your glasses for distances as well as reading it would be easier just to go full time. Even though her prescription is weaker than mine she can't read without her glasses any better than I can without mine. I'm guessing it's probably because her accommodation isn't as good as mine possibly due to the fact she is a few years older than me. She would never drive without glasses even though her distance vision isn't too bad but bad enough for her optician to recommend her to do so (she had been wearing her glasses for driving a little while before that eye test as she had discovered it made her eyes feel more comfortable). </p><p>The contacts my college friend gave me were comfortable but I didn't wear them for long periods. They were useful for when I went to the gym as my glasses would slip down my nose so I would end up tilting my head back to look through them or take them off completely. So with the contacts I could still see properly when exercising. I can't remember if the contacts expired or if I used them all up but I did get a strap for my glasses so they didn't slip. I just felt naked without glasses on my face. </p><p>I have been reading Eyescene but just haven't bothered posting anything. I have been reading a lot of the fantasy stories on Vision and Spex. A lady whose nickname is Zennia is particularly good, not just because her story lines often, but not always, include a lesbian relationship but her writing style just appeals to me.  </p><p>I'm a bit bored again as I don't start work today until 1pm and it's about 12:25 now. Starting late means finishing late &#128547;. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2017, 10:31</p><p>Carrie </p><p>First of all I was wondering where you have been recently? Nice that you're back. Sorry to hear that you're bored.  </p><p>Yes i guess that does make you a "low plus" both ways.  </p><p>Danielle has to be wearing her glasses out just by so  much taking them on and off and switching between contacts, glasses and sunglasses. The more you take off your glasses and fold them up the looser you make the screws on the hinges. She does seem to be getting closer to full time wear with each passing day. I know she doesn't want to be dependent on her glasses to see but the truth is she really can't see well enough to function without some form of vision correction anymore. Not surprising that her eyes get too dried out wearing contacts in the air conditioning at her work. So maybe she will soon decide that buying contacts is a waste of money. I remember a long while ago your college friend gave you a supply of dailies which was close to your prescription and you never said much about them but I think you did wear them a bit instead of your glasses. Were they comfortable enough to wear? I'm sure it had to feel strange to you not to be wearing your glasses. I doubt that you hardly used any of the contacts because you prefer wearing glasses.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus Tony</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2017, 09:43</p><p>Carrie </p><p> </p><p>Well it made me laugh (but them I'm also a low plus... in both senses!). </p><p> </p><p>It sounds like little by little Danielle is edging closer to becoming one of us (a full time wearer I mean) however hard she tries to avoid it. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for bringing a smile to the faces of those of us who are still at work!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2017, 07:58</p><p>I am short and have hyperopia. Does that mean I am a low plus? Lol &#128518;&#128517; </p><p>Sorry, crap joke. Bored. Finished work early today. Gemma's still at work and so are my friends. It's not even sunny today so I won't bother trying to sunbathe. </p><p>At least the last couple of weeks have been good for sightings of prescription sunglasses (it's been very sunny in eastern England and very hot as well over the last few days) I've seen both plus and minus prescriptions. Some prescriptions were probably full time others probably usually part time but a couple were worn be people I know but I didn't know that they wore glasses. A lot of the sightings were customers in the shop who hadn't taken their sunglasses off and the rest out and about. </p><p>My friend Danielle mentioned the other day that she can't wear contacts at work on hot days because the air conditioning irritates her eyes. She is probably wearing prescription eyewear for longer periods at the moment than she would in the winter. She has to wear glasses or prescription sunglasses to drive to work, then she will wear her regular glasses when working, then probably changes to prescription sunglasses if she sits outside for lunch. Back to regular glasses after lunch for the rest of the working day. Glasses or prescription sunglasses for the drive home. Then prescription sunglasses for the rest of the evening in her garden or our garden or a pub garden. She does tend to be bare eyed indoors unless reading something or watching tv, so perhaps doesn't wear glasses as much at the weekend just prescription sunglasses when outside.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NNVisitor</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2017, 17:30</p><p>Earlier today I was out and went to have my lunch that I brought with me. I sat at an unoccupied large table in an indoor public place. While eating and on my IPad two youngish near thirty year old females came and sat down. Across from me and a couple seats over I noticed that the woman who sat down there had very very thick minus glasses. My guess is -19  or in the -20 range. Beautiful plastic frames. Her friend did not wear glasses. I only glanced across once in a while so as not to make her uncomfortable. After five or so minutes she said hello to me and introduced herself.I told her my name and also said hello to her and her friend. She thought she knew me. I've never met her before. We had a chat for a while. She made eye contact during our chat. They left after spending about twenty minutes. Interesting day. I almost never see anyone anymore with such high prescriptions.

<p><b>Trent</b>&nbsp;22 May 2017, 19:49</p><p>I went into a drug store to purchase some things and noticed a young lady assisting at the counter.  She was wearing rectangular shaped black frames.  It was obvious the glasses were high minus because when she walked by I could see the lenses sticking out the back of her frame.  Lots of concentric rings, my guess the power was between minus 12 and 14. I made some small talk while paying at the till just to get an extended look. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;22 May 2017, 12:02</p><p>Danielle said that she wears contacts or glasses all day at work is because she needs them more for work than anything else. She kept her contacts in until around 6 on Saturday evening when they began to bother her. We were sitting at a pub table when she put her thumb and finger up to one eye and removed the contact then did the same for the other eye. She blinked a few times then looked quite pleased with herself for getting them out so easily. She held off putting her glasses on until a bit later when she had to read the menu in the pizza restaurant we went to. She took her glasses off after she made her choices and put them upside down on the table. Her glasses stayed there until we ordered dessert then she kept them on. She said she could feel her eyes beginning to ache. She now avoids wearing her glasses as much as possible again after work whether she's been wearing glasses or contacts all day. She thinks she's been wearing her glasses and contacts too much and was getting too reliant on them. She was annoyed with herself for putting the contacts in that morning. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 May 2017, 08:14</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Sounds like Danielle has maybe given up on trying to keep from becoming dependent on some form of vision correction. If she's wearing contacts on a daily basis it's the same as wearing her glasses full time. Now after wearing contacts for 10 - 12 hours a day i'm sure that when she takes off her contacts she will be quickly putting on her glasses. She isn't going to be bare eyed anymore I don't think, Her eyesight had gotten bad enough that she not only needed her glasses for seeing close up but even her distance isn't that good anymore. I'm sure that you much prefer seeing her wearing glasses and maybe after a while with messing with contacts she may go back to full time glasses. Also as you know she really shouldn't wear her contacts more than 5 days at time. So she really should wear her glasses the other 2 days each week for good eye health. So the good news there is that it seems that she prefers wearing contacts for work so that could mean she might start wearing her glasses over the weekend which is when you generally see her and Vicky anyway. Speaking of Vicky, how is she getting along with her new glasses?  </p><p>Okay so it is about 10:15 AM here in the US so I assume in the  UK it is around 6:15 PM? Are you and Gemma going out for the evening? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;20 May 2017, 06:36</p><p>Our friend Danielle popped in a short time ago and is going to drive us in to town. Her girlfriend and our friend Vicky is working at the coffee shop today so we'll meet her there. </p><p>When Danielle arrived she wasn't wearing her glasses (she often keeps them on for a bit after driving) so I presumed she had taken them off before getting out of her car. A short time later she received a text from Vicky. She read it and replied without her glasses. I asked her how she managed to do that. She said that she was wearing her contacts. She has been wearing them every day this week for work and has already got into a routine since getting her contacts. She wasn't going to wear contacts today but automatically went into the routine this morning and put them in. As they are one day contacts she decided to keep them in rather than waste them. </p><p>I asked her how she was getting on with the contacts. She said she was getting on quite well with them and has no trouble putting them in or taking them out now. "Most of the time I can't feel them but after 7 or 8 hours I start to notice them a little bit. After 10 to 12 hours I want to rip them out of my eyes so I always take them out before I get to that stage."she told me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;20 May 2017, 03:57</p><p>Tommy, </p><p> </p><p>they are not rare in Ireland and Scotland if that is of any use to you. They are rare in the Netherlands. I saw some more in the Mediterranean. In my youth there were many more girls with strong + glasses. This was before contact lenses became available in 1967. There were also quite a few ladies in cataract glasses as IOL implants did not exist either. Most of these ladies gave me the impression of being handicapped by their poor eysight. As a result, they were quite shy when you looked at them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adam</b>&nbsp;14 May 2017, 15:13</p><p>I don't know what happened during the last 2 weeks but I see more and more girls with strong minus glasses, somewhere between -5 and -10. The growing number of people with eye problems is one reason but I think the main reason is that glasses is becoming a fashion again against contacts. I'm very glad to see that they don't want to hide their glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;12 May 2017, 12:03</p><p>The woman we saw last week who's eyes looked a bit bloodshot does wear glasses! </p><p>Gemma and I were in the garden of our local pub on Wednesday evening as it was a lovely sunny evening and just about warm enough to sit outside. The woman came in to the garden and sat down at a table near ours joining another woman (a friend of hers it turned out) who was already sitting at the table. The friend did a double take and said "I didn't recognise you at first! The hair! The glasses!" The woman with the glasses explained her new look to her friend. She had got bored of her natural hair colour and decided to go for something completely different and got it cut very short and bleached it. The glasses are new. She had got her eyes tested recently and got a new stronger prescription. It was strongly recommended that she wore her new glasses or contacts as much as possible. She got a contacts trial but her eyes couldn't get used to them despite changing to a different brand and using eye drops. She didn't want to wear glasses but she had actually started liking them now. Her friend asked her what was wrong with her sight. She said she was a bit long sighted and has a bit of astigmatism&#8203;. Her friend said that she looked fabulous with glasses. A short time later I went in to the pub to get some more drinks and the woman with the glasses came in a few seconds after me also getting more drinks. As I waited to be served (the person in front was buying several pints including a Guinness which takes ages to pour) I casually looked around and saw that the woman was looking at some local events posters displayed at one side of the bar. This gave me the opportunity to look through her glasses from behind. I could see there was some magnification but she was a lot less long sighted than me and probably a bit less than my friend Danielle. I would guess at between +1 and +2. I could also see the distortion caused by the astigmatism correction. Her prescription didn't seem very strong but I am guessing her eyesight at all distances is affected much more by the astigmatism than the long sightedness. </p><p>Her frames were very nice - dark tortoiseshell plastic ones. Quite thin and delicate. Very feminine in total contrast to her hair! I had to stop looking as it was my turn to be served. She got back to her table shortly after I got back to mine. I managed to sneek a few looks at the woman with being noticed but then I got distracted. Gemma had moved even closer to me, any closer and she would have been on my lap, and wanted cuddles and kisses. Obviously I was more than happy to oblige! I don't know how long it had been when I looked around again but the woman and her friend had gone. Bit of a shame but I can't complain when I have a very affectionate and beautiful girlfriend to look at.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 May 2017, 09:23</p><p>oopsl </p><p>Okay! Don't be getting any ides. Remember you only want to be a little bit nearsighted. Any idea when you're going to be ordering your glasses and sunglasses? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>oopsI</b>&nbsp;08 May 2017, 11:15</p><p>Today I think I actively noticed the first myodiscs in a real live person. It was an elderly lady in the bus. It surprised me a little, because I rarely see high minus glasses in a person over the age of forty (usually they wear plus lenses or something maybe up to a -5). The glasses looked awesome, as the frames looked very unique, too. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;08 May 2017, 10:26</p><p>I just came back from a trip to Paris a few days ago.  I noticed a lot of 20-40 year old women and would say about 6 in 10 were eyeglass wearers.  The most popular frame seemed to be tortoise or black frames that were rounded at the bottom and had a key hole bridge.  Those were the most prominent frames, though there were the usual Ray Bans and the like as well as 1960's large round metal frames which in my opinion were not too flattering.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 May 2017, 14:41</p><p>Carrie </p><p>A couple weeks ago as I was searching for something to watch I came across that new version of Mythbusters you're referring to.

Actually when I came across it I was thinking it was a repeat of the original show that knew had went off the air.  </p><p>The competitor is okay but that scientist, Dr. Tracy Fanara is gorgeous indeed, with and without glasses.

The trailer shows each of the competitors. Two of them caught my eye. One of them is called Sarah who has a pleasant face and wears large black plastic framed glasses <a href="http://r.ddmcdn.com/s_f/o_1/cx_141/cy_0/cw_431/ch_431/w_431/SCI/uploads/2016/12/MBSSarahPetkus.jpeg" target="_blank">http://r.ddmcdn.com/s_f/o_1/cx_141/cy_0/cw_431/ch_431/w_431/SCI/uploads/2016/12/MBSSarahPetkus.jpeg</a> . The other one to catch my eye is possibly one of the sexiest scientists in the world! After a bit of Googling I discovered she is called Dr Tracy Fanara. I find intelligence sexy so that combined with good looks and a great body is something I like very much. She is also petite - about the same height as me (Yay for us shorties!).

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;04 May 2017, 23:01</p><p>Gemma and I were out walking yesterday evening when this woman came the other way. She looked about our age and was walking a cute little dog. She was quite striking to look at with very short blonde, possibly bleached, hair rather like Kristen Stewart currently has her hair (I did get a bit excited for a moment as I thought it was Kristen!). Gemma asked her if she could stroke the dog and the woman stopped and said "Of course, he's very friendly." I noticed the woman was blinking a lot and her eyes were a bit bloodshot. I think she was wearing contacts and they were bothering her eyes. Obviously I couldn't look closely enough to try and see them. We didn't want to hold her up any longer so we said goodbye to her and the little dog and we continued our walk. </p><p>Definitely one to look out for.

Specoholics!! </p><p> </p><p>Best to only do it with women on their own, too risky if with a male partner, who may take offence. Ok with female partners I have found. </p><p> </p><p>Find the moment, create a visual confrontation, and open with a bland comment , then have several followups ready, if they show interest, " by whom are they made" invites them to take them off, as most dont know the maker, and follow on from there, if they are plus, cant read the label, and there is your brake to get your hands on them, and play it by ear from there.

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;24 Apr 2017, 11:31</p><p>Past weekend we rented a beachside house with another couple, good friends of us. As there was only bathroom, we let our friends use it first, and when they were finished I went in together with my wife. As we undressed and changed into nightwear, I noticed our friend had left her glasses on a cabinet next to the washing basin. Her glasses were most of the on top of her head instead of her nose, and she only really used them when driving, watching television,... I had always wondered what her prescription was and here came my chance. </p><p> </p><p>While standing behind my wife who was cleaning her face, and applying moisturizing crème while looking into the mirror, I carefully took the specs, unfolded them and asked my wife to close her eyes. I delicately slid the specs onto her face, which came as surprise to her and she exclaimed "what are you doing?" while opening her eyes. I told her I was curious to see how Cath's glasses fitted her, and being a glasses wearer herself, she quickly commented that she in fact liked the frames, while turning her head and observing herself in the mirror. She said the lenses were probably around -2.5 and asked whether I liked the frames. Of course I did, we started kissing, got really excited and went into our bedroom with her still wearing Cath's glasses :) I put them back 30 minutes later where we had found them, as we both felt a bit guilty of what had happened, but we had a good time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>cubicle</b>&nbsp;24 Apr 2017, 10:37</p><p>Earlier on I saw a very pretty 30 something brunette with blue eyes wearing quite strong plus glasses. High index in a round in a big metal circle frame.  </p><p>Made her blue eyes very googly. From the front you couldn't see the sides of her face as the magnified eyes took all the lens area, and from the side the lenses were quite thick in the middle.  </p><p>She didn't seem self conscious at all.  </p><p>We got off at the same stop and walked side to side for a while in the crowded hallways as she starred at her phone. So crowded that I almost brushed her hand a couple of times and I was very careful not push her and make her fall (she would certainly lose her glasses and people would trample them).  </p><p> </p><p>How do you talk to a woman in such a situation ?  </p><p>Do you stumble upon the girl and help her pick her things up (cliché) ?  </p><p>I really wanted to try her glasses ans also see her without them.  </p><p>Do you just say "hi, can i try your glasses ?", i've seen a couple of times where a girl asked to try a guy friend's glasses in a bar, it works, but the reverse ?)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cubicle</b>&nbsp;24 Apr 2017, 10:21</p><p>I was in the subway, standing in a crowded car holding the handrail. Next to me a 20something brunette was sitting on the foldup seat, wearing oversized plastic -7 glasses. </p><p>My stop arrived and I need to get down so I let go off the handrail and turn away to start walking off. But my hand brushed something. Not knowing what I turned back and saw the girl pushing her glasses from way down her nose where they shouldn't have been.  </p><p>I'd almost knocked the girl's glasses off on the floor of a crowded subway car !  </p><p>I then apologized and got off.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2017, 05:51</p><p>I'm just thinking about all those women who, if they didn't wear glasses, would not get a second look from me. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Apr 2017, 12:39</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I was hoping to hear from you soon, but I figured it wouldn't be until Vicky got her new glasses. So i'm sure you enjoyed watching her get fitted with her glasses. She has wore glasses long enough now that she knows when they her glasses adjusted just right for her so they are completely comfortable on her. Was she rather picky about that or did she seem easily pleased with them? No surprise that she felt a little drunk when she put them on for the first time. Like the optician told her that the feeling she got was very normal. And it will likely take a few days for her eyes to fully adjust to them. I'm sure you had at least a smile on your face when she was told that it would be a good idea for her to wear her glasses full time until her eyes adjust. They don't that she only takes her glasses off when she goes to bed and she would probably wear them then as well if she didn't think they would get broke. She makes a point of always getting prescription sunglasses when she gets glasses which is nice since she is never without glasses. If she really likes her old glasses frames you're right she should get her new prescription put into them. I know the optical stores hit you pretty hard for just lenses but there are several places on line where you can send your glasses in and have the lenses changed that aren't too bad price wise. She has nothing to lose by doing that because once her eyes get adjusted to her new prescription her old glasses will be useless to her as they are now.  </p><p>I'm sure you enjoyed watching her as she was comparing her eyesight with her old glasses, no glasses and her new glasses. Were you surprised when she said that she said that distances were about the same with her old glasses and without glasses and perhaps slightly better without glasses? I know the reason she wanted to get her eyes checked was because she thought she needed her glasses stronger for seeing distances. Did she give any idea as to how well she could see things at a distance without her glasses? Of course as it turns out she was right that her glasses did need changed but it was because her astigmatisms had gotten worse. So i'm sure she has to be happy that everything is better with her new glasses on and at the time her eyes were still adjusting them so it could even get better after she wears her glasses for a while. </p><p>Danielle I think she is starting to understand that she really can't go very long anymore before her eyes start to feel tired. What that means is that from the time she opens her eyes in the morning she is straining her eyes. She doesn't even need to be doing where she needs to see close up anymore. Everything from short to long distances are straining her eyes. You were right by not saying anything to her. I'm not sure why she is resisting wearing glasses so much. She already has a great girlfriend and she knows that without a doubt Vicky doesn't have a problem with her wearing glasses in fact she has to know that Vicky wants her to start wearing her glasses full time because she is such a glasses freak herself. All of her co workers knows that she need glasses and most if not all of her friends. I now she insists that she doesn't want to be dependent on her glasses but she really is and just doesn't want to admit it. You and Gemma are probably her best friends and you both wear your glasses full time. Thanks for the update.              </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;22 Apr 2017, 11:14</p><p>We met up with our friends Vicky and Danielle in town today shortly before Vicky picked up her new glasses. We went with her. When she put them on she commented how intensely clear everything was but did feel as if she was a little bit drunk. The lady fitting Vicky's glasses said that was normal and the feeling would go away within a few days. She also told Vicky it might be a good idea to wear her glasses all day for those few days and then as she felt necessary. I thought to myself "As if she needs a reason to wear them all the time!" She also got a pair of prescription sunglasses in which she looked very cool. Later on she compared how well she could see with her new glasses to how well she could see with her old ones. Distances were about the same with or without her old glasses, perhaps slightly better without and close up was better with her old glasses than without. With her new ones everything was better. She said she was going to miss her old frames, so I pointed out that she could get new lenses put in them. </p><p>Danielle had resisted wearing her own glasses most of the day but put them on to look at her phone when we stopped for a coffee and a bite to eat in the coffee shop where Vicky works (she got a discount for us). Danielle kept her glasses on after she finished with her phone. She took them off to clean the lenses and then put them back on. She complained that her eyes were tired already and it was only mid afternoon. The only way she can relieve her tired eyes is to put her glasses on. I was going to ask how she got on wearing contacts for work this past week but she didn't seem like she wanted to talk about her eyesight any further at that point.</p><p></p><hr>

That's fine but you could be exposed if the person should ask you a technical question that a doctor would be expected to know. You did very well by pointing out that Ray-Ban is a famous maker of frames and that they have been popular for years and by pointing that her glasses were a good fit for her. And you made yourself even more believable when  you commented that you could tell that she was longsighted by looking at her lenses. So well done. Because she had already told you that she had gotten them 2 weeks before and that she was still getting used to them. You could have asked her if seeing distances was still a bit blurry for her with  glasses? But you did very well with what you did say. And of course I have a feeling you might be returning there in the near future. So if you see her again you can still ask her if she has gotten used to wearing glasses and if her distance vision has cleared up or if it is still a little but blurry?   </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> to her for seeing small  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2017, 15:44</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Thanks for posting that. Very interesting indeed. So Vicky is actually slightly less farsighted but she has had a sizeable increase in her astigmatism correction. Since astigmatisms effects eyesight at all distances that is why she was feeling like her glasses needed to be stronger. It's good that she enjoys wearing glasses because her glasses are going to be more necessary to her than they have been. As you know her current glasses are actually weaker than your first glasses were. And even after your eyes were fully adjusted to your glasses you could still see well enough without them if you needed to. But the addition of astigmatisms is going to make her eyes very uncomfortable anytime she has her glasses off. She might even find adjusting to her new glasses a bit difficult until her eyes adjust to them. They could make her feel dizzy and nauseous while the floor appears to be slanted. From what you have said she has her glasses on pretty much all the time she is awake which is good because now if has her glasses off more than a few minutes she would almost certainly get a nasty headache. </p><p>Honestly I am surprised that Danielle's eyes hasn't changed since last year when she got her eyes checked. Maybe her eyes aren't going to change much anymore. As I recall her last increase was only +.25 so in 2 years that is not much of a change. But interesting that the optician point blank told her that her eyes aren't going to ever get any better and that she shouldn't try and resist wearing her glasses when she needs them even if that means she needs to wear them full time. That is about as close as you can get to telling her that she really should be wearing her glasses all the time now. The fact that she got a couple boxes of contacts to wear at work I think means that she just doesn't like how she looks wearing glasses. Sadly I think she could be getting close to going to full time wear with contacts.  </p><p>Anyway you and Gemma have yourselves a very happy Easter.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;15 Apr 2017, 11:12</p><p>My friends Danielle and Vicky had their eye tests today. They are staying over tonight so we can have a good old girly night in with some wine and good food. They have just popped out to get some wine and snacks which gives me a chance to look at Vicky's new prescription that she has left on the table. She got it out earlier when she told us she does need new glasses and read out the prescription. Getting a chance to read it was an opportunity not to be missed. Vicky's prescription is now L Sph +0.50, Cyl -0.50 and R Sph +0.50 Cyl -0.75 . Looking back at an earlier post of mine here on Eyescene I found her last prescription was Sph +0.75, Cyl -0.25 in both eyes. So it's not surprising that Danielle's old glasses at +1.00 made things worse, she needed less +sph not more. Interesting that her astigmatism has got worse and her long sightedness&#8203;has got better. </p><p>Danielle was right when she said she was sure her prescription hadn't changed and the advice from the optician was pretty much the same as before by what Danielle said. Interestingly she did buy a couple of small packs of contacts (1 pack for each eye presumably). She's going to use them for work. She also said that the optician was very honest with her and told her that her vision wasn't going to get any better and not to resist wearing her glasses if her eyes feel uncomfortable without them even if it means that she has to wear them all the time. </p><p>Vicky did seem pleased that she still has a genuine need for glasses. Her new glasses will be ready in a week to 10 days and I am in no doubt she will wear them full time. I don't know what she thinks of the fact that Danielle is going to wear contacts during the week. </p><p>Danielle wore her glasses to drive here but put them on the table when she sat down. She grabbed them when she and Vicky went to get wine and snacks so she could read the labels. </p><p>My own gorgeous gwg is in the kitchen making something for us all to eat. She loves cooking but gets annoyed when her glasses steam up if she gets too close to a pan when she takes the lid off or too close to the oven when she opens the door.</p><p></p><hr>

As soon as I got home I searched online and found what I think were her specs ,a French company called Parasite, some very nice frames on their site. </p><p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sOfczD1-Wl0/TKYJeGzdH_I/AAAAAAAABxE/arT8FFZUYrE/s1600/VARANA+limited+2.jpg" target="_blank">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_sOfczD1-Wl0/TKYJeGzdH_I/AAAAAAAABxE/arT8FFZUYrE/s1600/VARANA+limited+2.jpg</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Affleck</b>&nbsp;13 Apr 2017, 11:54</p><p>Two long-term sightings  </p><p> </p><p>I am taking the bus each morning for years now and some fellow passengers seem to do the same. </p><p> </p><p>One girl was about 9 or 10 when I first saw her in glasses. Didn't see her often but over the years I saw her with several pairs of glasses, always noticably stronger than the previous one. Later she obviously had contacts, so I didn't see her in glasses for a while. In the meantime she became a young lady, about 20 years old and when she doesn't wear contacts she can be seen in a pair of large Ray Bans and I estimate her rx to be about -7 or -8. So cool. </p><p> </p><p>Another young woman, about 20 years old, often enters the bus with no glasses on, takes out her phone and starts doing something, playing or texting. After a minute or so she puts her glasses on, quite strong plus glasses and I wonder why she doesn't wear them on the way to the bus. She looks out of the window with them on too, so they are not just reading glasses. I estimate her rx to be about +6 at least. She keeps them on when she leaves the bus and probably for the rest of the day. </p><p> </p><p>I love public transport, so much more to see than going to work by car!! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2017, 10:26</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I'm looking forward to the weekend now that you have told me that Vicky and Daniele will be getting their eyes checked. So I really hope that you have maybe made plans on getting together with them later on Saturday or Sunday.  </p><p>I forgot to mention that when Vicky tried wearing Danielle's old +1.00 glasses and she said that they didn't help and only made her vision seem worse. I'm sure Vicky had to wonder why since she actually wore those very glasses for a long while before she got her own glasses. Well the reason is very simple. When Vicky got her eyes examined she was given her first real prescription which also included astigmatism correction in her glasses. This is something you now know about yourself. You only have a small amount but you notice the difference the make in your glasses. That's why Danielle's glasses didn't seem to help. From now on she won't be able to wear any of Danielle's old glasses anymore because of that. So she is going to be relying on her own need for glasses from now on. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2017, 11:55</p><p>Anon, </p><p>There is nothing she could have done to become that Myopic, unless she was doing GOC.  Very high, natural Myopia, is almost always caused by Genetics.  There could be some contribution by visual environment factors, but that is typically very small. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2017, 08:55</p><p>At the shops the other day- a seriously nearsighted late 20s redhead with big plastic frames, she must be at least -13. Her glasses kept sliding down every time she looks down and looked really awkward on her due to the extreme prescription- you can see white rings even at the bottom of the lenses. The frames hid the thick lenses really well as it was barely noticeable but they must be really heavy. What did she do to her poor eyes to get them this bad? Poor girl must be completely helpless without them!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Apr 2017, 11:22</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Did you find a way of asking Vicky if she was planning on getting her eyes examined or did she just mention it? I'm not at all surprised that Vicky wants to get her eyes examined and i'm sure she is hoping that she will be needing stronger glasses. If she goes in telling the doctor that her distance vision doesn't seem quite as clear she likely get an increase even if she doesn't really need an increase. Just like you have always heard that the customer is always right. Well that same thing applies here. The patient is always right. Because if she feels like her glasses are too weak she won't be happy be told that her eyes didn't change because it is in her mind that they did. So it is much easier for the doctor to simply increase her by maybe +.50 in both eyes. The doctor knows that her eyes will be able to adjust to a little stronger glasses and she will be happy and they will be happy because she will likely buy new glasses form them as well. Everybody wins! Nice that she is making Danielle get her eyes checked too. Now of course with Danielle the last thing she wants to hear is that she needs an increase. But remember her last eye exam was a year ago. And as you pointed out at that time since the increase wasn't much she didn't get new glasses. But not long when her glasses broke she did finally get the prescription she was given a year ago put into her new glasses. And sadly for Danielle it seems that every time she gets her eyes examined they get a little worse. So it is very possible that she might need another increase this time. But since her glasses aren't very old they might be nice to her and change the lenses for her at no charge. So I think Vicky will be getting an increase and new glasses which is exactly what she wants and Danielle is hard to say either way. Her job as a graphic designer has taken its toll on her eyes because everything she does is straining her eyes. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;09 Apr 2017, 03:47</p><p>My friend Vicky thinks she needs new glasses. She said distances don't seem quite so clear. She tried Danielle's old +1.00 glasses (the ones she wore before getting her own) but they actually make it worse. She has booked an eye test for both herself and Danielle for next Saturday. Danielle agreed to get her eyes tested so Vicky wouldn't nag her. It's very nearly a year since they last had their eyes tested but Danielle only got new glasses earlier this year only because her existing ones broke. Danielle is sure her prescription won't change.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brett</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2017, 12:30</p><p>Soundman, that was kind of what we thought too: she changed to glasses to "prove" she had them, but it also almost seemed like she wanted to show solidarity or something with my wife.  Like she was truly genuinely excited to see the trifocals.  And definitely seemed to like her own bifocals.  She didn't really get into any details about why she tried progressives or if her contacts are bifocal.  I was kind of surprised she carried her glasses to work with her when she was wearing contacts.  I was thinking the co-worker could probably see better through the add because her minus wasn't as strong as the other one's, but maybe yeah it was better than her own prescription.  I have definitely wondered the last few years as the bigger glasses haven gotten popular, if it was for progressive compatible frames.  It would be interesting to hear the statistics on college kids that have adds.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Apr 2017, 09:39</p><p>Brett </p><p>You and your wife had an interesting sighting for sure. I'm sure you were quite surprised when that young attractive clerk complemented your wife on her frames an that she thought it was "so cool" that she wears trifocals. But even more surprising when she admitted to trying progressives, but she always felt sick and off balance so she went back to wearing bifocals. I wonder if she maybe thought that you and your wife didn't really believe her because i'm sure plenty of people have commented about how young she is to be wearing bifocals. That was probably why she tried wearing progressives because that way no one would know that she was really wearing bifocals which would end the comments. So that could be why she felt like she needed to prove to you that she was telling the truth. I'm sure her contacts must cost her quite a good bit. So by wearing contacts she doesn't get all those questions about her wearing bifocals. But at home she wears her glasses and she already plans after college to be staring at a computer screen while wearing glasses. But it was nice that her glasses wearing co worker asked to try her glasses on. I'm not at all surprised that the co worker seemed to like how well she could see through the add segment. It was probably more comfortable than her own glasses. It used to be not that long ago that prescribing a woman with her first bifocals was like a fate worse than death. It was like they were being called "old" because bifocals was something you never got until you were into or past your 40's. But now it is not nearly as rare to find someone 20 wearing bifocals, of course many of them get progressives so there is no tell tale line. It would be interesting to see a survey as to how many college students now wear bifocals.  </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brett </b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2017, 20:41</p><p>Thanks Oscar, I forgot to mention earlier that your sighting sounds nice too. The hearing aids and glasses combo in a younger lady is nice.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2017, 19:01</p><p>Brett - what a great sighting. Teens/college girls in bifocals are usually stunning - and far too rare. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brett</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2017, 18:31</p><p>Haven't posted anything in a while, but had an interaction that was too good not to mention.  My wife is farsighted/astigmatism and has had multifocals since high school and about 5 years started with lined trifocals when she was in her late 20's.  For the last few years, she has only worn trifocals and likes them better than progressives.  It doesn't come up much when go out, but once in a while somebody says something.  The other day we stopped for fast food and the clerk was late teens/early 20s, about 5'8, attractive, blonde hair, nice white teeth/good smile.  At the time was wearing contacts.  She commented to my wife that she really liked her frames and thought it was "so cool" she wears trifocals.  Then she  told us that she tried progressives, always felt sick or off balance and went back to bifocals.  We ordered and went and sat down and didn't think much of it, but then the same girl came out and over to our table as we were finishing, wearing bifocals, as confident as ever, and smiling big and pointed at her glasses saying she wanted to show us so she took out her contacts.  Nice black plastic, fairly modern style cat eye, prescription was about -5, and definitely the bifocal line was nice and prominent.  Could see the power the rings but the thick plastic frames covered the lenses nearly entirely.  Said she always wears her glasses when studying at home at nights, and that her career goal after college would be staring at a computer so will probably just wear glasses then.  Another clerk was nearby cleaning tables and overhead some of this, also probably teens, kind of cute, and wearing what appeared to be -3ish range in just a traditional gunmetal rectangular frame, as the bifocal clerk was walking away, she said I want to try your glasses.  So from where I was sitting I could see/overhear how that went.  Clerk #2 said she could see thru the bifocal part but the top was too strong and that she could tell her astigmatism wasn't corrected.  Was fun watching her look down through the segments for the first time and figure that out.  Bifocal clerk said yeah she doesn't have astigmatism. As they were walking back to the counter, a male clerk was manning the register (wearing low + glasses) said to the 2nd clerk, those plastic frames looked nice on you.  So definitely no embarrassment by these folks about glasses, and it was fun seeing such confident young people and their glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2017, 18:18</p><p>Oscar, </p><p>You understand the situation much better than I do. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2017, 17:18</p><p>Cactus Jack - I know. I've had a hearing aid for my right ear since I was 7 years old (my left ear has no hearing). </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2017, 16:53</p><p>Oscar, </p><p>Hearing aids don't always work well in high noise environments.  They are not like wearing glasses.  You have amazing ability to sort out what you want to hear in a noisy environment with natural hearing.  If you wear hearing aids, you loose that ability.  Even if you wear two hearings aids, you loose a lot of ability to detect where sound is coming from.  Two hearings aids are better than 1, but not as good as your natural hearing even with mild hearing loss. </p><p>Like a lot of older people, I have high frequency hearing loss (above 2 KHz). With "open fit" Behind-the-Ear (BTE) hearing aids I can hear up to about 6 KHz.  Open fit hearing aids have a hole in the ear mold or passages in the transducer that fits in the ear canal to let the lower frequencies in.  My hearing aids do nothing below 2 KHz, but amplify frequencies from 2K to 6K.  They work pretty good, but are not perfect.  They have two microphones that I can select to only use the forward pickup in a location where the people I want to hear are in front of me, but not the ambient noise.  Another disadvantage is that if I hear an emergency vehicle siren, I can't tell where it is coming from and I have to look all around me to try to detect flashing lights. </p><p>In-the-ear hearing aids, typically do not have very good low frequency response because they are so small and the transducer can not push enough air to move the ear drum very much.  After trying both types, I prefer the BTE type because the sound is more natural.  To me, wearing hearing aids is no different than wearing glasses.  They are just tools that help me function better.   If someone does not like it, tough! </p><p>C. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2017, 16:09</p><p>Wonderful sighting at Piccadilly Circus underground station today. I found myself on the escalator behind a curvy girl in tight jeans with her red hair in a ponytail - showing her behind-the-ear hearing aids. That was exciting enough (I love seeing pretty girls in hearing aids) but when we got to the platform I was able to take a look at her glasses from the front. They were stylish Raybans, about -10, or maybe a little bit stronger - very nice indeed. She was mid-20s, with a gorgeous smiling face framed by her red hair, and chatting with her boyfriend/husband. I noticed that she was watching his lips rather than his eyes through her strong glasses so that she could hear what he was saying. The whole sighting was incredibly sexy, and continued for the next five stations on the train itself until I had to get off. Made my day.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2017, 10:29</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Nice that Danielle and Vicky came by to give you a lift home. They really are good friends. And good that she was wearing her glasses. You had to love that your coworker and friend happened to walk by at that time and and noticed that Danielle was wearing new glasses since she last seen her. Little things like getting a nice complement on her glasses has to boost Danielle's confidence level up. Danielle's answer when she was asked if she needs them all the time was really interesting. It's really the same thing she has been saying for a good while now but I wonder how much she really believes her own answer. That the optician told her she could wear them full time but if she chooses not to then she should wear them whenever her eyes feel strained or tired when looking at any distance. Then she goes on to say that she chooses not to wear them all the time but she was wearing them then because she finds that her eyes feel tired after work even though she wears them at work. The truth is she puts her glasses on as she leaves her house because she needs them for driving, she keeps them on all day at work and they stay on even when she gets off work because she needs them to drive back home. The truth is by then her eyes are completely adjusted to her glasses and everything is very blurry without her glasses. So maybe after she gets home and she isn't reading she might take her glasses off around the house before she goes to bed and she can probably go without glasses on weekends if she isn't going anywhere. I totally understand that she just doesn't want to feel dependent on her glasses but i'm pretty sure that now anytime she isn't wearing her glasses she is straining her eyes to see anything now. Maybe seeing your work colleague wearing her glasses and seeming to mind that she needs her glasses all the time might be some encouragement to Danielle. I remember very well when your co worker got her first glasses. I think she liked her glasses but she probably assumed that they would be something like a new ear rings that she could wear when she wanted to and not wear if she didn't want to. She had no idea that it wouldn't take long before her eyes would start to see double vision without her glasses. But she seems to have accepted the fact that she can't go without glasses anymore. Yeah i'm sure you will just have to wait for a perfect time to ask Vicky is if she is planning on getting her eyes checked anytime soon. I'm really surprised that Vicky didn't enter into the conversation at your dinner party when the subject of glasses came up. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2017, 06:29</p><p>Danielle and Vicky met me at work on Wednesday, shortly before the end of my shift. Danielle had her glasses on when she came in and they stayed on. Her new glasses are only +0.25 stronger than her old ones but look more than that. I think it's the slightly thinner frames than her old ones had that make the lenses look stronger. My friend and colleague, the one with the prism prescription, always seems very happy to see Danielle and always greets her warmly even though they don't know each other very well. On Wednesday she said to Danielle "Ooh, I really like your glasses are they new?" Danielle thanked her and told her they were new. My friend then asked if Danielle needed them all the time. Danielle replied that her optician said she could but if she chooses not to she should wear them whenever her eyes feel strained or tired when looking at any distance. Danielle also explained that she chooses not to wear glasses all the time but was wearing them now because she finds that her eyes feel tired after work even though she wears her glasses at work. My colleague said that she doesn't have much choice about wearing her own glasses all the time as she gets bad double vision without them as well as not being able to see very clearly near or far. Danielle said that she has most trouble seeing clearly close up and distances aren't too bad but her glasses do sharpen up distances even if she hadn't noticed it isn't as clear as it should be. Danielle complimented my colleague on her glasses, saying they went very well with her face shape and good looks. This made my colleague blush. </p><p>As you can imagine I enjoyed hearing that conversation very much! </p><p>Danielle drove me home and she and Vicky stayed for a few hours. The glasses stayed on. Danielle said she is sure my colleague was flirting with her, pointing out that my colleague couldn't take her eyes off her and possibly used the conversation about glasses to get closer. I told Danielle that my colleague has not shown any interest in women and is very interested in men, especially her boyfriend, but I would discretely ask the next time I saw her. (I didn't tell Danielle that my colleague told me she has slept with another woman once to satisfy her curiosity) </p><p>Unfortunately there was no more glasses related chat and I couldn't find a reason to ask Vicky if she was planning on getting her eyes tested this year.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2017, 15:03</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Yeah I also remember that you used to wear fake glasses at school and since she knew you back then she wouldn't have been at all surprised that once you got your glasses you would want to wear them full even if you didn't really need to. I think you might be wrong that she doesn't know know you like girls wearing glasses. She just say anything since she trusts you and you have never given her any reason to not trust you. I wouldn't at all be surprised if that wasn't a big reason she started wearing her glasses shortly after you met up again. Remember you were encouraging her to wear her glasses around the same time.  </p><p>Well Danielle is certainly a head strong young lady isn't she. She is still determined to somehow not to just put her glasses on everyday and keep them on and forget about it. She is actually working hard trying to avoid wearing glasses as much as possible. But yet she really knows that she pretty much needs them all the time now. If she needs to see to drive then that means that her vision is blurry at a distance constantly not just when she is behind the wheel of her car. But sadly i'm afraid that once she finally realizes that she needs to wear them full time she will then go back to wearing contacts again. I think the only hope is if you and Vickie can keep telling her how good she looks wearing glasses. Speaking of Vickie next time you're around her i hope you can figure out a way to ask her if she plans on getting her eyes examined anytime soon? Don't you think that she still wants her eyesight to get a little worse so she needs stronger glasses again? This is the longest she has wore the same pair of glasses isn't it?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2017, 14:26</p><p>Soundmanpt - Gemma sort of guessed that I have wanted to wear glasses for a long time. She remembers me wearing fake glasses at school. She doesn't know that I like girls with glasses. She just knows that glasses don't put me off, much to her relief of course! </p><p>We've been together for 6 years now! Love her more than ever! </p><p>Danielle has sort of gone back to her old ways a little bit. I did manage to bring up the subject of glasses when we saw her at the weekend. She said she does actually wear her glasses more than used to as she has realised how much she was straining her eyes. She wears her glasses all the time during the week, even when socialising, so her eyes don't feel so tired in the evening (when she began wearing her glasses for driving she used to take her glasses off after getting home but now doesn't bother). At weekends her glasses are just for reading and driving but if needed she would wear them if her eyes felt like they were straining. She said that she's gone from someone who sometimes wears glasses to someone who sometimes doesn't! She would rather not have glasses but obviously can't deny her need for them. She would never go for surgery but did give some serious thought about getting contacts again. She decided not to get contacts this time but will certainly consider getting them in the future. So she isn't full time but she is wearing her glasses a lot.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2017, 21:34</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p> Julie said that the reason she was interested in ordering online is because she has eye exams every two years, and her next one would be a year and a half away, and also she liked the idea of saving on the price of glasses. </p><p> We did discuss the thickness of her lenses, and she said that that does not bother her at all.Her current lenses are high index, but she said in the past she usually wore the thicker lenses, and applied the savings to buying better frames. </p><p> Yes, we went with the lined bifocals in + 1.50 add. </p><p> She said that she never owned a pair of rimless, and is excited about their look. Cheryl had her rimless lined bifocals in her purse as her backup,and modeled them for Julie.She did not try them on, because when she tried Cheryl's other pair she could not see at all due to Cheryl's high Rx. </p><p> Oh yes Cheryl gave her the full rundown of being a new bifocal wearer. The two of them really got along so well.She seems to bond better with women that  wear fairly strong glasses. I guess it is a we are in the same boat kind of thing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cubicle</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2017, 07:12</p><p>I also saw a hot woman with blonde hair up. I only saw her from behind, and her glasses had earpieces going straight down, like they only do for strong prescriptions. Then i saw super strong plus lenses in big frames, shining light atound. She walked down the street in heels and mini shorts. I couldn't talk to her as I wasn't alone. </p><p>Hot !</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cubicle</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2017, 07:08</p><p>The other day in the subway, i was sitting in front of a sexy myopic blonde. She was reading with her glasses sliding down her nose a lot. She wore a mini skirt and flats with a red coat. She was -10 I'd say, lots of power rings. Her glasses went down her nose in less than a minute, then she pushed them up and crossed her legs. Pretty hot. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2017, 14:53</p><p>Likelenses </p><p>Honestly I am surprised that she called you. Nothing personal but generally speaking it usually takes a bit more of getting to know someone before they will accept your offer to help. But if she is really struggling with trying to see to read that may have pushed her a good bit. Whatever i'm sure you were happy to hear from her, I hope that she is going to be happy with her new glasses. She has a fairly strong prescription as i'm sure you are well aware of and with rimless glasses even more noticeable. Did you tell her that her lenses are going to be quite thick? So did you go with +1.50 for her add? It was a very good idea that she picked out something with adjustable nose pads in case they need to adjusted for her eyes to use the bifocal properly. I assume that she got lined bifocals? Based on what her total price was for both pairs of glasses. Nice that Cheryl was giving her pointers about things she will need to adjust to with bifocals. I would assume that high on the list was steps and curbs? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2017, 23:35</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p> The woman ( Julie ) that I spoke with on Saturday about reading glasses called me yesterday afternoon,and asked if we could meet,so as to order her some online glasses. </p><p> I took Cheryl along,and we met her at my friends shop.She did have her Rx from six months ago. I  was not far off, it is RT.6.50 Lt. 6.75.I had to measure her P.D. </p><p> She and Cheryl hit it off, and Cheryl helped her to navigate the Zenni selections, and pick out some frames.She decided to get a pair of rimless bifocals with the standard lenses,and because she realized the bargain prices, and free shipping for an additional pair, ordered a pair of roundish plastic $13.00 frames with a reduced prescription to use as readers.Her total was $ 53.95.Since Cheryl has been in bifocals for some time now she explained all of the things a newbi to them needs to know.Julie asked Cheryl if she could try hers on, and when she did, she said , " Wow, I thought that his were crazy strong, but yours are even more ". </p><p> She promised to take us to lunch in a few weeks, in thanks for our help, and to show us the new glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2017, 11:05</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Sounds like Gemma and you had a great time on holiday and you both seemed to notice some nice looking young ladies wearing glasses as well. Just curious since you and Gemma are a couple and have been now for a good while, most people in a relationship claim they don't keep any secrets from their partner. So have you ever told Gemma how you always wanted to wear glasses and how thrilled you were when you found out that you actually needed a weak prescription which you only needed for reading but you wore them full time just because you wanted to wear glasses so much? I'm pretty sure even if you haven't said anything about your feelings seeing other young ladies wearing glasses she has to know. But being the good woman that she is as long as you don't touch she is okay with it. By the way how long have you been a couple now? Nice that no one in Portugal seemed to care or notice you were a couple. Too bad the whole world isn't as excepting. So now that you're back home what's the latest with Danielle? The last report was that she was told to wear her glasses full time for a couple weeks so her eyes would adjust to her slightly stronger prescription. She was doing as told but still not liking it too much. So has she returned to old ways of trying as hard as ever to avoid wearing her glasses or after wearing them full time for a couple weeks has she decided that she really needs to be wearing glasses all the time now? I'm sure that the glasses wearing Vicky would love to see her wearing her glasses all the time too. When you were all together at dinner and a glasses discussion came up I wished you would have thought to ask Vicky if she plans to get her eyes examined anytime soon. Welcome back home! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2017, 14:34</p><p>Gemma and I were on holiday in Portugal last week. So many sightings! First one was a member of the cabin crew. She was a very good looking brunette wearing Wayfarer style frames with a prescription of around -2 to -3. Gemma took quite a liking to her too! Gemma also pointed out a woman passenger who looked quite a lot like Kristen Stewart but didn't wear glasses, but then Kristen only wears glasses in public occasionally. Could it have been her?! Probably not, but how lovely is Gemma pointing out someone that I will probably fancy? Very thoughtful and trusting. Once we were in Portugal I noticed that of the women that wore glasses, and there was quite a lot of them, most of them had a minus prescription. I think I only saw about 5 women under the age of 40 with a plus prescription. </p><p>Portuguese women are gorgeous and the people in general are very friendly. They had no problems about us being a couple (I didn't think they would) Of course the best looking woman there was my own gorgeous girlfriend. </p><p>Another thing I noticed was that most of the regular sunglasses I saw people wearing had mirrored lenses that had a gold or rose gold tint. It was very sunny in Portugal last week so there was a lot of sunglasses to be seen. I did see a few prescription sunglasses, although they just had dark lenses not mirrored lenses. </p><p>We had a lovely holiday in a country of beautiful countryside and architecture. The food is fantastic too! We would love to go back again but we will have to save up our pennies first!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Londoner</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2017, 10:51</p><p>The last time that I saw a lady wearing a pair of really strong plus lensed glasses was close to two years ago. On that occasion, on the same day, but in different locations I actually saw two ladies with strong glasses. The same thing happened again today. </p><p>A meeting in the morning overran so I was late having lunch and slipped into a small café for a sandwich and a coffee. At the next table were a mother and daughter. The daughter had her back to me initially and with long dark hair, I could not see that she was wearing glasses. After a few minutes, for some reason, she changed seats with her shopping and sat side on. She was wearing plus lenticular glasses. the light was striking at the perfect angle for me to get a really good look for about 10 minutes before they finished and left. They were small and neat, but the bowl only filled the inner two thirds of each lens and was at least one centimetre proud of the metal frame. Her vision did not seem to be an issue, using her phone, going to the Ladies or moving through a crowded café. </p><p>Later in the afternoon, I joined the queue for a bus. Immediately in front of me was a small lady of about 40. She had a disabled bus pass hanging from her back pack, but it was a couple of minutes before she turned side on and I realised that she was wearing one of the strongest pairs of plus lenses I have ever seen. They bulged out nearly 2cm and were heaving ground back at the top, bottom and at the bridge. Again, she seemed not to have a major problem boarding the bus or finding a seat. She was only on for two stops, but I could see her well all of the time even though I was standing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2017, 19:25</p><p>Likelenses </p><p>Sounds like you had an interesting day for sure. Even with your help and explanation i'm pretty sure she would have no idea how to place an order for glasses on line without your help. By simply telling her that she needs to order glasses that are +1.50 weaker than her current glasses most likely went right over her head. First of all you and I both know that she doesn't have a clue what her prescription really is to start with so she would first need to go back to either where she had her eyes examined or where she got her glasses from and get a written copy of her full prescription. And even then she probably wouldn't understand how to subtract the +1.50 from her prescription either. So if she doesn't contact you i'm sure she will just muddle along as she is now. If her optometrist has already suggested that he would be prescribing her with bifocals at her next visit that is really the best way to go anyway instead of fooling around with 2 different pairs of glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2017, 19:02</p><p> More than a sighting. </p><p> A good friend owns a small store that sells unique items.She has a display of reading glasses, with decent frames, and priced $ 12, to 15 dollars.I on occasion work for her when she needs to take a Saturday off. </p><p> While working today, a very pretty blond lady of about 40 with a prescription of about-7.00, was browsing, and stopped by the readers.She took her phone from her pocket, and removed her glasses, and was trying on various pairs. She then ask me how to go about picking a pair , because her glasses were about six months old, and she was having trouble seeing her phone, and reading small print, unless she held it quite far away, and without her glasses, had to hold it uncomfortably close. </p><p> She said at her last exam. that her optometrist mentioned that reading glasses, or bifocals would probably be coming her way at the next exam. </p><p> She said that none of the readers that she had tried seemed to be even close, and did we have some that are stronger.She of course did not understand the difference between plus, and minus glasses, and then to my amazement she said to me, "  your glasses look somewhat stronger than mine, would you let me try yours on? " My Rx is -10.5 for each eye, so I knew where this was heading. I removed them and handed them to her, and she put them on,and tried looking at her phone.I had to contain my laughter, as she said, " these are crazy strong, what kind of glasses do I need?"I put mine back on and while hers were still off, I ask if I could look them over. They were about - 7.00 with the left perhaps a bit more,and no astigmatism, or prism correction.I them gave them back to her and suggested than she take some + 1.00 readers, and try looking through them held closely to her glasses,with the arms folded.As she did this while looking at her phone, she said it was better, so we then tried + 1.50, and + 2.00.She said that the +1.50 seemed good but said that she could not see well in the distance. </p><p> After a lengthy explanation about the difference between plus, and minus lenses, and how her lenses need to be reduced for near, I suggested that she look at her Rx, and order on line, either a pair of bifocals, or reading glasses that are  + 1.50 weaker than her Rx. </p><p> She seemed to like the reading glasses idea, better than the bifocals, so I said why not get both. </p><p> I gave her my number and said if she needed help ordering,to please call. </p><p> Needless to say, this made my day!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2017, 14:16</p><p>To the person who commented at 09:00 25 Jan - Danielle is one of my closest friends and regularly see each other for a good chat, which is what we did at the weekend. I think she wanted a good moan about her glasses and didn't want to subject her girlfriend to any further moaning :-) </p><p>To "OMG" - we don't swap glasses as that would be worse than not wearing glasses at all!:-D </p><p>Soundmanpt - I have been quiet on Eyescene because I felt I was spending too much time on it. As I have said before Gemma doesn't care what I look at but she does mind being neglected. She is not clingy or an attention seeker just very loving and affectionate and wants to snuggle up on the sofa with me and watch tv or chat if we are not going out somewhere or having friends over. If I've got my face buried in my phone or tablet for too long she feels lonely.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2017, 11:38</p><p>Carrie </p><p>That's the problem when you are putting on and taking off your glasses quite often. What she has actually doing is wearing her glasses out. The worst thing s you can do is opening and closing and on and off and then often putting them on top of her head. The advice she was given about not putting her glasses on top of her head was dead on. At the very least it will stretch out her glasses so they won't stay in place whens she does wear them. I assume that her glasses were a plastic frame and that is even worse because a metal frame may bend but won't break as easily. Even though her lenses were okay finding a frame that her lenses would fit into would be nearly impossible. Since she didn't get new glasses when she had her last eye exam that means her glasses were probably nearly 2 years old and the optical shops change inventory about every 3 - 6 months. They do that for style change and nearly everyone gets new frames when thye get new glasses which is often every year. It would be too costly for stores to inventory frames say for 3 years. Besides they would rather sell you a complete new pair anyway. Actually I think Danielle really should have gotten her eyes checked before buying new glasses. Her eyes have gradually been changing every year and and I don't recall exactly when she had her eyes checked last but it has to be getting close to a year. I know that her and Vicky both got their eyes examined at the same time and I think Vicky has had her (prescribed) glasses for close to year. Generally once you pass the half way point, 6 months, then you should go ahead and get an eye exam because it is likely there has been a change in prescription. You and Gemma have had glasses for some time now and I don't recall you or her having any issues with your glasses breaking. A very simple reason is because you both wear your glasses full time. So your not opening and closing your glasses all the time. When you take them off at bedtime you likely leave them open so their easy to slide on in the morning. You're right though that you can't tell her to wear her glasses full time. But you can laughingly point out that you have never had any of your glasses break because you keep them on so they aren't as likely to get broke.  </p><p>You've been very quiet in here, I was wondering where you have been. I know you can only come in here at certain times because Gemma doesn't know anything about "eyescene" and you want it to stay that way.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;24 Jan 2017, 16:20</p><p>My friend Danielle's glasses broke last week. She said she was wearing them at work and they fell apart as she pushed them up her nose a bit. One of the arms fell off and her glasses fell off her face. Luckily the lenses didn't get damaged. She couldn't find the arm hinge screw that had popped out so had to tape the arm back on. She went to her optician after work to see if they could fix her glasses. Unfortunately they couldn't be fixed because the screw thread in the hinge was damaged and wouldn't hold the replacement screw. She ordered new glasses. She said the optician said she didn't need an eye test as she had one less than a year ago and they would use that prescription (very slightly higher than in the glasses that just broke at +1.75 and +2.00. She didn't bother getting new glasses at the time of that eye test as the difference in prescriptions was so small). She was also told that she should avoid putting her new glasses on top of her head as this puts a lot of strain on the hinges and was highly likely the reason her current glasses broke. </p><p>They taped her glasses again for her so she could still use them until her new ones are ready. She said they asked if she would also like contacts. She said that she actually thought about saying yes but thought she would get too dependant on them as she nearly did the last time she tried contacts so said no. She added that if, in the future, she needs to wear glasses full time she would also consider getting contacts then. </p><p>Because her current glasses are taped they can't be folded to go in the case and she isn't putting them on top of her head any more (the tape would probably break if she did) so she has actually been wearing her glasses a lot of the time. She doesn't want to put them down anywhere in case she forgets to pick them up again! She doesn't really want to wear them so much but she would struggle to read without them and doesn't like to drive without them on, especially at night. </p><p>I still think she might as well go full time but I'm not going to tell her that.</p><p></p><hr>

Her rx was very low and it took me a while and some repeated discrete glances to work out if it was a plus or minus prescription. But during this process I did get a smile from her. It was I decided a low plus. I think she was a new wearer as she kept pushing the frames up. But spent a lot of time looking at her phone.  As we neared my station and an announcement came over the tannoy she took the glasses off to read the signboard indicating the next station. This clinched it she was a newly converted glasses wearer  and had not yet got used to middle distance vision. </p><p> </p><p>As I left the carriage I hoped she was getting off at the same station so I said "great glasses' but alas just at that point she looked down and her phone and didnt hear me (earbuds too).  </p><p> </p><p>The tragedy is that because the trains are so frequent, every 6 minutes or so, it's rare to see the same GWG two days running.  Nonetheless, before christmas I did strike up a conversation with a lovely german lawyer, 30 something GWG who I met on different trains. As we parted on our first journey she gave me her business card, but I think I;ll keep it just as a 'brief encounter'.  I'm beginning to think that the  part of my job I like best is the getting there and the coming back. Or is that a bit sad ? </p><p> </p><p>Chris</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2017, 10:24</p><p>T </p><p>You're on the right track as for my name / title. For many years I ran sound for my friends band. I did that full time for about 15 years and then part time after that. The band was formed with 4 high school friends that just happened to be musicians. Two of them were brothers after about 6 months a fifth member was added and as it turned out that person awas A 16 year old Michael McDonald. He only stayed for about 2 years but he left as a friend A few short years later he became the keyboardist and lead vocal of The Doobie Brothers. If you go on YOu Tube you will find a good number of osngs by them. Most all of them feature Michael singing. Including "What a Fool Believes" and Takin it to the Streets.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;10 Jan 2017, 21:47</p><p>Danny, </p><p>You new friend probably had to have the older type of Cataract Surgery where the Crystalline Lens Capsule and the clouded Crystalline Lens are removed  completely.  That is sometimes necessary even today under some circumstances where the Capsule cannot be left in place and Intraocular Lenses (IOLs) installed. </p><p>The Crystalline Lens is a fairly powerful PLUS lens typically around +18 or +19.  Because of Vertex Distance effects, her glasses mush have much more + for her to be able to see.  However, strong PLUS lenses have all kinds of optical problems.  In many ways they act like Binoculars with very limited peripheral vision in all directions.  She is very smart to use the cane to help her avoid objects in her path. </p><p>Strong - glasses act like wide angle lenses which reduces the size of the image on the Retina, but have better peripheral vision if there is not too much retinal damage. </p><p>One of our members who needs very high PLUS glasses described what he sees sitting in a compartment on a train.  He said he could see the person sitting directly across from him, but could not see the person sitting on either side of the person across, unless he looked directly at them. </p><p>Who knows, to quote Humphrey Bogart at the end of the movie Casablanca. "This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship".  Good luck. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

They don't seem particularly heavy, they're just standard rectangular wire frames but she almost never pushes them up so when she's looking down at her phone (often for great lengths of time i might add) she pulls it right up to her face looking over her glasses tapping away and squinting at the text. I've always wondered why she never bothers to push them up she even continues to look over her glasses most of the time when using the computer leaning forwards quite far in her chair. </p><p> </p><p>I'll try and be on here often, seems there's a great little community here :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adam</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2017, 11:17</p><p>I know a nice blonde blue-eyed nearsighted girl who has very bad vision. When I first saw her I immediately that her eyes are a bit turning out but she has no lazy eye. Besides that, her eyes were always a bit squinting. She wasn't wearing glasses but it was easy to notice that her eyesight is not good. She is always wearing contacts, I have never seen her in glasses because she was shy to wear them because of bad experiences with her primary students classmates. Once we had a plan to meet but some hours before she refused it because her eyes became red and she had to wear glasses. I couldn't convice her to come.  </p><p>Later, I could get to know and experience more about her eyesight. Once she needed to read something on the wall which I could see easily but for her it was a big challenge, she was squinting hard. </p><p>But the most shocking moment was during one of our facebook conversations. She told me that she is never watching their TV in the living room because she can't see it. She also told me that she tried a stronger prescription but it was even worse. Maybe her eyesight reached a point when it can't be fully corrected. I don't know why I didn't ask her prescription... </p><p>I had one more shocking moment with her. A photo was taken from us in a camera in whick you have to sit in (and two other girls with perfect vision). These machines are not big, so we had to focus on the camera from about 1 metre. However, her eyes were turning out with quite big angle and she was squinting. Okay, it was in the evening with less light but 1 metre is a very short distance, it is easy to just see on a camera, don't have to read anyting, just looking at.  </p><p>And the last time we last met was also interesting. Once I just read someting on the side of the bus from about 20 metres. It is not close but the letters were quite big. She told me that she can't read it.  </p><p>According to these experiences, she can be very blind without her glasses/contacts. Even she is blind wearing them. Once I saw a picture about her younger sister, she is not as nice as her but her eyes are even more turning out and more squinting so it's a family heritage. </p><p> </p><p>What do you think, how strong are her glasses/contacts? I have tips but I am interested in your opinion. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2017, 17:01</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Your memory is good I don't have any family left to celebrate Christmas with and it used to bother me quite a good bit but as time has gone on I have tried my best to move along. Sorry to say it's still not my favorite time of the year and I am glad once we get to January 2nd. You would be amazed at how much outdoor Christmas decorations I have. For years I would start decorating my yard and house with over boxes and boxes of lights and things around mid November. Now they are all stored in the attic portion of my garage. I don't even bother with a tree. I do chat with my friends and I think they are checking up on me because they know I used to get quite depressed at Christmas time. But honestly it's much better now than it used to be. It's funny when you think about it. As a child you look so forward to Christmas time but as you get older it can be the time you want to not even come. </p><p>I am not at all surprised that you have been receiving lots of complements on your new glasses. It's nice to have glasses that are fun to wear and I have a feeling that is the way you feel about them too. They have to be light on your face and nose which that alone would make them very comfortable to wear. No surprise that Vicky was impressed with your glasses. I have feeling that she is very much like you in that she notices every attractive young woman she sees wearing glasses. I'm sure she probably found your glasses very comfortable when she tried them on. I bet they looked really good on her as well didn't they? Do you think she might want to order a pair for herself? Only problem for her is that she couldn't see very well since your glasses are much too strong for her eyes. She was probably happy to put her own glasses back on wasn't she? Danielle is determined not to give in and just keep her glasses on all the time isn't she? But she is facing a losing battle. It probably won't be long before she is needs to get her eyes examined again and she is going to need another increase and this time her distance vision is sure to be worse if she now needs her glasses for driving. She may be told that she needs to start wearing her glasses full time. I wonder if Vicky will also get her eyes checked since it has to be close to a year since she got her current glasses. You know she has to hoping to get an increase soon. I need to go and start practicing on writing 2017 on things. haha   </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2017, 15:52</p><p>Hello Soundmanpt  </p><p>Yes we did have a good Christmas thank you, and have just about recovered from celebrating new year! I remember you said you had no family left to celebrate Christmas with but I hope you managed to see some friends though. </p><p>I wasn't too sure how much someone at -3 could see. I thought she might end up at the wrong table!:-D  </p><p>I don't like to ask Gemma what she could see when she had weaker prescriptions as she gets a bit worried about needing stronger prescriptions and she also might think it strange if I keep asking questions about her eyesight. </p><p>I've had a lot of compliments on my glasses. Vicky does like them and has tried them on, getting me to take a photo of her with her phone. </p><p>Danielle is still wearing her glasses only when she really needs to but does always wear them when driving. She still avoids wearing them otherwise.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2016, 11:00</p><p>Carrie </p><p>First of all I hope that you and Gemma had a very good Christmas and that you both enjoy a Happy New Year.  </p><p>That attractive woman you saw at the pub first with her glasses on top of her head and later wearing them probably hasn't gone to full time wear with her glasses yet. If you are correct with your estimate that her glasses were around -2.00 or -3.00 her eyes may not be dependent on her glasses yet. You get much more dependent on your glasses the more you wear them. Remember Gemma wasn't dependent on her glasses until she started wearing hers full time. And at -2.00 certainly she wouldn't be able to see things clearly but she would be able to see well enough to walk safely back to her table. And even at -3.00 she could manage if her eyes aren't always fully corrected or if she only recently got an increase in her prescription. But i'm not surprised that she was soon wearing her glasses when you saw her last. She could be just trying to hold form becoming dependent on her glasses. A battle she is likely to lose.  </p><p>So by now i'm sure all your friends have seen you wearing your new glasses. What comments did you get. You know that Vicky is as big of a glasses freak as you are so I have a feeling she really liked them and probably wanted to try them on. A short while ago you said that Danielle was starting to wear her glasses more and more often including full time at work now. Is she still appearing to be getting closer to going completely full time. I know she is one that doesn't want to become dependent on her glasses but because of the type of work she does which is based on small detail and requires her eyesight to be as good as possible she has no other choice but to wear her glasses and the more she wears them the more she is going to need them. I have a feeling Vicky would love for Danielle to be in glasses full time. I know you love Gemma with all your heart no matter, glasses or no glasses, but i'm sure it's an added bonus that she wears glasses all the time. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2016, 08:18</p><p>I was in a pub with a bunch of friends just before Christmas. We were at a table near the bar. At one point I looked up at the bar to see if there was many people waiting to be served as we are were going to need more drinks soon and I saw a woman with a great figure standing at the bar with her back to us. I then noticed that she had a pair of glasses on her head that appeared to have a minus prescription in them. Not a weak prescription, I would guess at least -2 but probably nearer to -3. Obviously I couldn't watch her for long but I did manage to get to see her walk away from the bar to another part of the pub. I only got a side view so I couldn't see her face properly but I could see that her glasses were still on her head. I don't know how she managed to find her way back to where she was sitting without her glasses on! </p><p>I saw her later on as we were leaving and she was coming towards us, probably to go to the bar again. This time she was wearing her glasses on her face. She was fairly attractive too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2016, 03:58</p><p>Three bifocal sightings in London yesterday. </p><p> </p><p>First, a teenage girl with her family on a train, she wore her plus bifocal glasses on the top of her head. She did wear them for about 30 seconds looking at her phone. But then returned them to the top of her head for more texting. </p><p> </p><p>Second, in a lunchtime pub, a group of 5 mid-twenties playing charades. One of the females, short brown hair, slim wore fairly strongish plus lenses, probably around +5. When it was her turn to read the card for the next charade, she swapped those glasses for a pair with a single much more powerful lens in one eye and a bifocal lens in the other. Once she had finished reading, she swapped back to the original bifocals. </p><p> </p><p>Finally, a boy of about 9 or 10; he had -2 ish glasses but the bifocal reading section was very strong. Interestingly, he spent the time on the tube looking over the top of his glasses to read the list of stations in the tube.</p><p></p><hr>

At some point a middle aged woman falls and glasses fly away. Everybody says "The glasses! The glasses!". She quickly retrieves them. Very low minus. No harm done. </p><p>There were some cute young women in skirts and thick glasses (plus or minus) though, all of them pushing their glasses up constantly and having their butts protruding in fear of losing them or falling.  </p><p>Very nice !</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2016, 17:19</p><p>Murky, great experiences, thanks for sharing with us. </p><p> </p><p>I now always try to have the owner's consent when trying on specs. I am quite positively surprised at how much ladies appreciate my commenting on their good looking glasses, and are most happy to let me try them on... Some time ago I did not dare to engage in a conversion with a stranger about her eyeglasses. </p><p> </p><p>But I have experienced so many positive reactions lately, and glasses are being looked at as an accessoire increasingly often. It is quite amazing how many pairs of sexy specs, owned by stunning ladies. I was able to hold and/or try on since. As both the owner and myself are happy, why not? </p><p> </p><p>I must admit I sometimes tried on glasses without the owner knowing/agreeing I was doing so, but it never became a sour story. I always ask myself afterwards why I could not resist the temptation, but that's probably what a fetish is about... Fingers crossed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cubicle</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2016, 10:01</p><p>@eyestein </p><p> </p><p>Yes, she leaves her glasses at her desk most of the time. She then walks with a soft soft gaze. She wears them only to read someone else's screen or her own. </p><p>She can see certainly well enough to go around it seems.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eyestein</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2016, 08:37</p><p>Just a further thought on the subject of the plano-concave on one side. I have seen a pair of glasses with a prismatic dish in the front of one lens. Obviously it was for a serious amount of astigmatism. So flatness on the front might in some cases reduce the amount of cylinder required at the back geometry of the lens. So the high myopic asian girl I saw might have had high astigmatism in one eye. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eyestein</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2016, 07:52</p><p>@Cubicle </p><p> </p><p>Do you mean every time she walks away from her desk she leaves her glasses behind? That's something I would like to see. It's very likely that everything more than a foot away is blurred. She must have memorized the floor plan well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eyestein</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2016, 07:39</p><p>@Puffin and Likelenses </p><p> </p><p>I couldn't really estimate the Rx. It might have been near -10 on the flatfronted side which I think was the strongest. It wasn't the first time I have seen one only flatfronted lens on a young person. I have also seen obviously unbalanced Rx's where both lenses were the more common divergent meniscus. So I am not sure of the reason for just one flat front.

<p><b>Eyestein</b>&nbsp;24 Dec 2016, 18:39</p><p>An very affectionate young Asian couple were waiting at a bus stop. They would have been in their late teens or early twenties. The girl was wearing very strong glasses. One of her lenses was flat-fronted. It flashed light around like a mirror. She was as horny as hell and seemed to be oblivious to any onlookers standing around. He seemed less enthusiastic but I think he was more conscious of the public exposure. She took her glasses off very briefly. I mean for about two seconds! I am not sure why she did that. She actually put them back on before landing her lips on him again. It might have been intended a sexy gesture to take off the only thing she could take off in the situation. It might have taken her only two seconds to decide she needed to leave her glasses on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;23 Dec 2016, 15:39</p><p>Went to an electronics repair shop today, had to take a seat as the two sellers/technicians were helping other clients already. A lady in her mid forties then entered the shop, looked around, and quickly realized she also had to take a seat (next to me) and wait for her turn. </p><p> </p><p>She was quite slender, nice haircut with blonde hair just above her shoulder, and wearing very flashy slender barbie pink plastic frames with noticeable minus prescription. It did not take long before she started complaining to me about the waiting time, her car being parked off-limits, problems she had with her phone,... She just kept talking and I did not have to say much as she changed subject every minute herself. I had noticed she was carrying a Pearle Vision bag with her, so I decided to compliment her about her choice of pink frames (which suited her really well) and asked whether those were Pearle Vision. She was charmed by my comment, and told me yes indeed she had just picked up those new frames, as she had used a buy-1-get-2 promotion last week and, because of the good deal, she had chosen for a bolder color. She kept talking and explained how she was now using glasses more and more as an accessoire, to match outfits, look different on different  occasions,... I asked whether she was happy with  the lenses also, suggesting they were somewhat stronger, and enquiring about how shz felt about Pearle quality of the lenses. She agreed it was key to a good a pair of glasses, especially because she was -5.5, did want slim lenses, and this was her first time with Perale. </p><p> </p><p>Given her ease to talk to a stranger, I asked whether I could have a closer look at her frames because I (truly) liked them and would enjoy my partner also picking a flashier color. She said waow you really like them, took off her specs, handed them over to me and asked what I thought of them. I inspected her glasses from different angles, insisted I wanted to be very careful as they were brand new, and then handed them back saying they looked great for a 79 EUR frame including lenses. She laughed, put them on, said now she could see again, ans said my comments were a relief to her as she would see friends over lunch and was not sure whi they would react to her pink frames. We continued to chat about diffrent subjects, but what a great lady!</p><p></p><hr>

Amazed by the number of women of all ages wearing glasses - significantly over 50%.  </p><p>As you would expect the older ones are mainly plus, mostly readers, though a lot stayed on during the interval, but a couple of stronger plus included - definitely long term wearers. Also one 10 yr old with a strongish plus prescription. A few young low plus as well. </p><p>The younger portion of the audience are mostly myopes, but surprisingly most in this group have quite significant prescriptions - few low minus. One or two close to double figures including the young mum (30ish) with baby in front of me who is wearing small metal frames with serious cut in. </p><p>A good concert!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2016, 15:18</p><p>Intriguing sighting yesterday at a working meeting abroad. I was introduced to a new member of the local team, a nice and young engineer around her mid 30. Immediately wondering if she had perfect vision or not, but no glasses on her eyes or around her, no squinting, so I concluded she must lack that nice plus that a vision defect represent for me, although she was quite cute. </p><p>At a certain point she wanted to see a document I was preparing and came close to my laptop screen. After a short chat on technical stuff, I found myself looking straight into her brown eyes and.... bingo! She had contacts!!! </p><p>I look forward to meeting her again in the future (our teams meet about every 2 months) and I hope to have opportunity to see her bespectacled or at least to enter into a vision related conversation to discover her prescription!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2016, 02:21</p><p>Interesting sighting on the way home yesterday of a bit of glasses sharing. Three young girls (probably 18-20 years old), two brunettes, and one stylish black girl walking down the road, I could see from behind that one of them was wearing gold aviator glasses with myopic / short sighted lenses. Nothing unusual there one thinks! </p><p> </p><p>As I walked along they greet their friend who is further down the street walking towards them, as they get within a few feet of her, the young brunette takes off the aviator glasses and passes them over to her trendy black friend who upon putting on her (?) glasses hugs her friend and they walk the other way from which I was going. </p><p> </p><p>I wonder who the glasses belonged to originally, I suspect the latter, the large gold aviators went very well with her dark skin, but I wonder how well the brunette saw with her friends glasses and for how long she was wearing them, or was it the other way round? Anyhow, an interesting sighting.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2016, 12:34</p><p>Carrie </p><p>It's great to finally have my computer back and working great. It was a terrible 3 weeks being without it.  </p><p>I knew I forgot about replying to another comment you posted and in reviewing I see that it was you and Gemma bumping into one of your former teachers. How long ago was it that you last saw her or had her as a teacher? At least she still recognized both you and Gemma considering the number of students she has probably taught and the fact that both you and Gemma are now wearing glasses. Were you surprised that she commented that your prescription didn't seem to be a weak one? She must have thought that your glasses look pretty strong to her. Plus lenses do often appear to be stronger than they really are. That is likely why she was wondering if your eyesight may have caused problems in school? But you clearly didn't go without glasses for very long before you got your first glasses and they were on the weak side. Even though you wore them full time you were still able to see quite well without them. Oddly enough when you had her in school she wore glasses and now she wears contacts. Sadly by now all the teachers I had i'm quite sure have died by now.      </p><p></p><hr>

So i am at a nearby library which has computers available.  </p><p>The two customers you mentioned clearly sounds like that less attractive young lady may have recently been prescribed with glasses and her friend the more attractive one was only trying them out. The logical reason her friends glasses may have started bothering her eyes most likely was because they had some astigmatism correction in them.  </p><p>Not surprising that Danielle is slowly starting to wear her glasses quite a bit bit more. Without a doubt by her wearing hr glasses full time while at work is having an effect on her distance vision now. Yes of course being a graphic designer she needs her glasses for all the close work she does but i'm sure she is also looking at things in the distance as well and she eyes are adjusting more and more to her glasses. So by the end of her work day taking off her glasses to drive home has to getting more difficult for her. I'm sure she probably is starting to realize that she really needs to start wearing her glasses all the time now.   </p><p></p><hr>

Danielle's glasses are Sph +1.50 and +1.75, I don't know which eye requires which prescription and I can't tell by looking as the difference between the lenses is so small (her most recent prescription was +0.25 stronger but her optician said there was no need to get new glasses unless she wanted new frames) Danielle wears her glasses mainly for reading and close up.

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2016, 12:43</p><p>Our friends Vicky and Danielle have just arrived. Danielle was wearing her glasses! She said she has found that her eyes feel better if she wears them for driving especially at night. This is a new thing for Danielle. She has been avoiding wearing her glasses for distances as much as possible. It seems that she has given in. Probably a good idea to wear glasses for driving even if they only make your eyes feel more comfortable. </p><p>Unfortunately she took her glasses off a few minutes after arriving but put them on top of her head instead of in the case. This makes me think that she might wear them again this evening. Danielle and Vicky are staying the night so there is a good chance Danielle will put her glasses back on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2016, 16:34</p><p>Hi Carrie and Tom, </p><p> </p><p>this reminds me of a girl at school who forgot to bring her glasses (circa minus two) one day. She made the wise choice to move next to a full time GWG (circa minus four) that day and throughout all the lessons they were sharing the minus four glasses. Each girl used the glasses for about half a minute looking at the black board, then gave them to the other girl. When not wearing the glasses, they wrote down notes. It all went like clock work. This happened fifty years ago so your messages had the effect of a time machine. Thank you!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2016, 15:20</p><p>Hi Carrie </p><p> </p><p>Good sighting. Really one of my preferred sightings when women try on each other's glasses, with always a weaker and a stronger prescription shifting users, or a non-glasses wearer trying on a friend's pair. </p><p> </p><p>I often observe this in restaurants, when lights are dimmed and people struggle to read the menu. Either a woman says "I forgot my glasses can I use yours?", or (much better) a lady spontaneously takes off her own specs and hands those to another lady commenting "You really seem to struggle, try those". Some women vigorously protest and refuse to try on the glasses, while others do try and happily exclaim how well they can see with the specs and they will buy a pair themselves the day after.  </p><p> </p><p>It is a good sighting when such happens with readers, but so much better in a sports stadium or movie theater when (strong) minus prescriptions change hands.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2016, 14:30</p><p>Today at work two young women came in. One very attractive the other not so attractive and both vaguely familiar to me as occasional customers. The better looking one was wearing large plastic framed glasses with a low minus prescription. But within a couple of minutes the better looking one said to her friend "Here, you can have these back now they're starting to give me a headache." and took the glasses off and passed them to her friend who put them on. They then continued with their shopping. I didn't see them after that as I was restocking the shelves. </p><p>I'm glad I saw them come in. Such a disappointment that the glasses didn't belong to the better looking one but the brief time I saw her wearing them was good. Obviously I couldn't look for long anyway in case they, or someone else, saw me and also I was busy. I haven't seen the woman who owned the glasses wear glasses before. Maybe they are new. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2016, 10:18</p><p>Dear Anonymous. At least I post using my name... I did nothing else but try on her specs, look through the lenses, have a very good look at them. And, yes, there was a very remote risk of her waking up, but that's part of the excitement for me. Very low probability when asleep on a longhaul flight after a few glasses of wines... I also tried out glasses of women when at their places for a drink or sleeping there. No more no less. I still cherish the moment, she never found out and will never do so, so what?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2016, 15:11</p><p>Another great night flight. Sat next to a nice Italian woman, flying business class, we chatted before take-off and during dinner. After dinner the cabin light s were dimmed, she put her seat in the bed position, took off her glasses and went to sleep. I had of course noticed her glasses as soon as I had take my seat: slender black round plastic frames, gold metallic temples, prescription about -3 my best guess. She was deeply sleeping wihin 30 minutes, and I couldn't help but look at her specs that lay opened upside-down on her tray table wihin "grabbing" distance. As the cabin was now almost fully dark, and the lavatories' sign was green (vacant), I quietly stood up, took her glasses with me and went to the lav. I made sure the door was properly locked behind me, and I had all the time to try on her glasses, which I felt extremely exciting. It looked she was a pure myope, with no cilinder, and very similar prescription in both eyes, maybe even weaker than -3. I made sure her glasses and lenses were bright and shining before returning to my seat, and putting her glasses back in exactly the same position as they had been.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;12 Nov 2016, 11:47</p><p>We were out shopping earlier today and we happened to meet an old teacher of ours. We haven't seen the teacher since we left school but she still recognised us. She said "It's Carrie and um Gemma, isn't it? I thought you looked familiar but there was something different about you both. I realised that it was the glasses!" She couldn't remember either of us wearing glasses at school even though Gemma wore glasses to see the board in all lessons and I wore fake glasses quite a lot for a while. I reminded her about that and quickly explained that Gemma has got more short-sighted since school and I discovered that I am long-sighted and have some astigmatism and we both need to wear glasses all the time.(our old teacher knew what astigmatism is). She commented on my glasses, saying "I don't wish to sound rude but your prescription isn't a week one. Do you think you would have done better at school if you had realised much earlier that you needed glasses?" I replied "Maybe. I possibly didn't do as much revision as I could have done because I got tired when reading. I didn't realise then that I was tired because my eyes were working so hard to focus." She noticed the way Gemma and I looked at each other and, along with how much I knew about Gemma, worked out that we were more than just friends. She was impressed how long we have been together and that we have our own place together. But she was surprised that I ended up in a same sex relationship as she often saw me flirting with boys at school. I explained that I was just joining in with what my group of friends were doing and I was unconsciously in denial and I only had feelings for the boy I was dating before I fell in love with Gemma after leaving school. It was during our chat that it suddenly dawned on me what was different about the teacher - she wasn't wearing glasses. When we were at school she wore glasses full time. If I remember correctly her glasses were a medium minus. She said she wears contacts now and it must have been after we left that she got them. </p><p>It was really nice to see our old teacher again and hopefully she is thinking the same about us.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2016, 08:19</p><p>Michael </p><p>When your co-workers were having their conversation about glasses I know you musy have wished you could have entered into it as well. But sadly you could only be an observer. But what you observed was very interesting. Not surprising that when the one that only wears -1.25 glasses tried on the -3.50 / -3.75 glasses i'm sure they felt much too strong for her eyes. Now if she had left them on for a longer period her eeys may have started to adapt to them better. But i'm sure she only had them for just a few seconds and her eyes had chance to adjust. Interesting what she was saying about not having her own glasses so she wore her sister's glasses that are -2.00 but they gave her a headache after only wearing them for about an hour. Wearing her sister's glasses of course was over correcting her eyes a bit. But really her eyes should have been able to adjust to them after a few minutes of wearing them. Most likely her sister's glasses also has astigmatism correction in them and that was what gave her the headache. The one that doesn't wear glasses I assume if she tried on the -3.50/-3.75 glasses very quickly returned them because they were much too strong for her eyes. But when she tried on the -1.25 glasses because they aren't that strong she was able to see quite well with them. Of course as she noticed everything in the distance was clear but smaller. Now if she would have continued wearing them they would have gotten even more comfortable for her. However if her job is a desk type job where she is looking at small print that may have been a more difficult for her to do wearing those glasses. Did she seem surprised at how well she could see wearing her co workers glasses? Often times borrowing or trying on a friends glasses is how people find out that they might in fact need glasses themselves. Now if the young lady, you didn't say what the ages of these ladies are, has a previous pair olf glasses at home with a slightly weaker prescription they would probably work really well for the one that doesn't wear glasses now. Of course it's very possible that those -1.25 glasses are in fact her first and only glasses. It does make you wonder after being able to see so well with glasses if she might go and get her eyes tested.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2016, 01:39</p><p>Sighting in our company yesterday: </p><p>Three female collegue talking about glasses. One wear glasses for myopia, one sometimes specially for driving or TV, one without any glasses. </p><p>The fulltime wearer gave her specs the other for trying. She said her prescripion is -3,5 and -3,75. The part time wearer tried them first, wear them for a minute and said that her prescription were only -1,25 in each eye. She can`t wear stronger glasses. Wearing her sisters glasses with only -2,00 watching tv for one hour because let her own in her flat she got terrible headache. </p><p> The girl without glasses put them on said nothing but walk to the window look outside came back and said that she can easily read all signs outside. There are no problem wearing the specs, everything is smaller with them on. Then she take a photo with her smartphone before returnrd the glasses to the owner.</p><p></p><hr>

And the "storytelling" well there is a site called "Vision and Specs" and they have thread for makeup stories. That is the place for made up stories. </p><p>So your friend is also a co worker of yours. She knows you wear glasses but she hasn't asked to try them or offered to clean them for you? But like you say she maybe on her good behavior because you're both at work. Maybe the next time you go out drinking with her you should make a point to wear your glasses and after awhile take you glasses off an put them on the table while you pretend to be wiping something from your eye. If she grabs your glasses then you know she has a glasses fetish for sure. If she doesn't it could be only with men's glasses that she takes an interest.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Beachin'</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2016, 17:54</p><p>I was out drinking with a freind the other day and discovered she is likely a closet OO. Two guys from the table next to us, both in glasses, came over and struck up a conversation. After a few drinks the guy I was talking to placed his glasses on the table for a moment and she picked them up, cleaned them, looked through the lenses, then above them, then through them several times. She replied, oh, you are not that blind and admitted that she liked looking through other people's glasses. I could tell the guys were both enjoying the show, ha. When she returned his glasses the guy she was talking to promptly took off his glasses and smudged the lenses and offered them to her to clean and try on. I think he regretted the bold move momentarily but she took him up on his offer and told him she knew what she was doing and wore glasses too (for reading). I couldn't hear the rest of the conversation because he moved in so close but I could tell they were both into it. I left the bar shortly after that but found out my "little OO friend" went home with the guy from the bar :). </p><p> </p><p>We chatted the next day about the guys but I didn't have the nerve to ask her about her OO tendencies.

<p><b>Bensmith</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2016, 07:43</p><p>Just at the library, two twentyish girls chatted about glasses. One of them said something about her glasses that I didn't quite catch, and the other replied: "Oh yes, you're wearing your glasses now." The first girl said: "I've had these for years but I almost never wear them. I really should wear them all the time but I can actually see fine, it's just that I can't see anything far away." The second girl said: "I know, I have that too, I always wear contacts." The first girl said: "I should wear these at school but I always forget." She took her glasses off, looked at her laptop about a feet and a half away and said: "I have such a horrible vision. Especially when I've worn them a few hours like now everything looks so blurry." The other girl said: "I really had to get contacts when I couldn't see without my glasses anymore. I recommend that, it's so much easier when you can see." The first girl put her glasses back on. The glasses didn't look that strong when I took a better look later.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;02 Oct 2016, 03:37</p><p>Fascinating story Soundman, even more so that you converted a non gwg into a gwg wearing someone else's prescription! What  a sight it must have been to see her wearing her 'new' glasses</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Oct 2016, 12:21</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I am very familiar with glasses like the ones worn by the girl in the picture. Remember I am and have been a member of a non profit vision group for well over 45 years. Back in the 90's I came across a number of glasses exactly like the ones she has on. They were gold frames with very tiny temples. They had plastic around the earpieces. Very light weight frame. Often time the lenses probably weighted more than the frame. Back then there wasn't high index lenses. Nearly all the ones I came across the lenses were exposed even with a rather weak prescription.  </p><p>It was during that time while I was often at the local shopping mall that at the time had 5 optical stores in it where I made pickups of donated glasses from. I knew quite a few people working in the mall and one was a young blonde girl working at a jewelry store. She always dressed and looked nice but she often wore long dresses. with her hair wrapped up on her head. Sometimes she had it down and it was very long. Anyway one evening when I stopped by to chat with her, I had just made my rounds of glasses pickups, she asked me what was in my bag? I told her I had just done my pickups of donated glasses. She seemed interested so i put my bag on the counter and pulled out several to show her. I mentioned that sometimes I get really old ones. After a bit she started describing glasses that she would really love to have. The reason she wanted glasses like that was because her mom was a hippie and even attended Woodstock and she saw several pictures of her mother wearing glasses like that. And she herself has a bit of hippie in her. What she described was the glasses you posted. I had several boxes of glasses at home that I hadn't been able to turn in. I went home and started going through several hundred glasses and found 3 that matched what she had described. Next time I went to the mall i took the 3 to show her. As soon she saw them she sid they were exactly what she always wanted. I told her that she could have all if she wanted. She tried each of them on and as she did she was looking around as well. I have no idea what the prescriptions were on any of the glasses. Two of them she said were too strong but she said that the one she could see pretty well with. I did tell her that she could get her own prescription put into them, but she only said she might do that. After that I saw her wearing the glasses several times at work and all she was missing was a flower in her hair. Sadly all the others were turned in. Honestly at the time they weren't glasses that i liked all that well. I was till more into the 50's style.   </p><p>   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2016, 13:00</p><p>The latest development in glasses frames seen in the streets of Holland is a return (on a small scale) of young ladies sporting round frames. One of them was a girl in large round hippie glasses with a mild minus prescription, early 1970's style. Any sightings of this "trend" in other countries?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2016, 05:46</p><p>gwgs and calcat30, high index materials can make a -16 look pretty good, especially if the frame covers some of the edge. I see people in even higher scripts without myodisks. CR39 was more of an issue, as the lower index means much more thickness. Back when glass was still used, weight was the real issue. Glass has a high index and is not too thick, but is much heavier than any plastic lenses.  </p><p> </p><p>As much as I'd be straining my marriage vows if I saw those lenses on a pretty woman, I just can't imagine any optician actually dispensing them. At least his newer glasses stayed up better. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>30calcat</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2016, 03:07</p><p>I have taken my -16 script into a few different opticians now and no one has ever suggested myodisc.  In detailed discussions with ECPe they tend to think the myodisc look is ugly despite the potential to be much lighter and thinner than the go-to 1.67 hi index lens.  Most probably don't know how to order a myodisc lens or what a blended myo is.  I wouldn't be surprised if myodisc lens blanks have disappeared off catalogues by now due to poor demand.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;27 Sep 2016, 01:17</p><p>NJ and 30colcat - I can agree with 30colcat that the power rings do multiply and expand if you like the higher up the myopia scale you go, and the power rings will also be more severe with bigger frames hence why you have said you can barely see his eyes. </p><p> </p><p>I have a pair of -15 myodiscs that are in a big gold aviator frame and the lens thickness does pretty much extend into the middle of the frame despite them being ground into a plano base (as opposed to a plus carrier where you expect the lens thickness to be in the middle), and I can only imagine that with twice the prescription and approximately the same, or similar size frame holding non myodisc lenses, they would be very heavy and thick. I know we all like thick lenses here, but I think we would also choose for practicality's sake, and you would think the optician, or even the wearer would choose to go with a more practical and cosmetically friend lens than this.</p><p></p><hr>

I have worn both myodiscs and thicker full field lenses, though not quite that high power.  I tend to get a lot more comments wearing myodiscs on how different they look, so I can see how some opticians and high myopes try to order steep biconcave curves and hi index materials as a more "modern" approach to high minus powers.  But lenses in this power are still relatively thick, and hi index can even introduce more infernal reflections and rings than lower indexes.  </p><p></p><hr>

I'm guessing he's in the -30 range, but the odd thing is that he does not wear myodisks. Instead, he has biconcave lenses with a severe front curve and fairly large frames, or at least much larger than he should be wearing. The edge thickness is enormous, and the power rings extend almost into the center of the lenses. He holds his head in that way people with extreme prescriptions do, tilted back and turning constantly to see. Even when he's a few feet away it's almost impossible to see his eyes, just the power rings. </p><p> </p><p>He's in his 40's, trim and fit looking, black and casually dressed.

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2016, 02:21</p><p>The "Carrie" immediately below was not me. </p><p>To answer gwg's questions - she could see better with her right eye with my glasses. I only have a very small astigmatism correction of -0.25 which I doubt made much difference to what she could see (I sometimes wonder if it makes much difference to what I see but it doesn't affect the cost of my glasses so I'm not bothered). Also my right eye prescription is +0.50 stronger than what she ended up being prescribed but this didn't appear to be much of a problem for the short time she was wearing my glasses. My left lens was just too strong for her left eye to focus at normal reading distance and she had to bring the menu closer to her face to focus. </p><p>We came to the conclusion that she would need glasses with a prescription that was reasonably different in each eye but we assumed that she would only need reading glasses rather than full time glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2016, 03:41</p><p>Soundmanpt - I don't think she really wanted glasses and seems to have been putting off getting her eyes tested for years despite knowing her near vision wasn't as good as it should be. Her accommodation must be pretty good to get to her early 20s without getting glasses. I think being unable to see the restaurant menu very well and finding that she could read it more easily with her boyfriend's glasses and then my glasses made her realise that she really should get her eyes tested. </p><p>Antonio - I thought that was a great way to describe the clear vision a pair of glasses give you, whether your first glasses or ones with a new prescription. I didn't even think of it as a female quotation. </p><p>Gwgs - my left eye is +2.5 and my right is +3.00 so I know what her right eye is like. I couldn't function very well without my glasses on all the time.

Funny thing, I have been on this site for well over 10 years and I have only seen "Worth Repeating" here for a week or so as well as all those no name cowards. maybe the answer is for everyone to come in and not use any name at all. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2016, 10:13</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Nice to hear that your friend's friend got her glasses. So you must have guessed about right when you said her bfs glasses appeared to be around +1.00. Only being +1.00 in her left eye that is weak enough that she hardly notices any difference with seeing distances with her glasses. But her right eye is considerably worse and i'm sure her distance vision in that eye is as she says "a little out of focus". Right now when she is looking in the distance i'm sure she is mainly seeing with her left eye. But like the optician told her, wearing her glasses full time she will soon be able to see distance perfectly with her glasses. I wonder if she realizes that her once distance vision won't be very good without her glasses anymore for a couple of reasons. First because her eyes are so out of balance with each other and second because her eyes will be adjusted to seeing with her glasses. She seems to be okay with the idea of wearing glasses now. And now that she has her own glasses which probably fit her better than her bfs glasses they should be very comfortable for her to wear. You even said that her bfs glasses were slightly bigger so they probably didn't stay in place very well and she was likely pushing them up quite often. Now with her glasses being a little bit smaller they probably fit her nose as well as behind her ears much better. And of course now she can see perfectly with her glasses as well which also should make wearing glasses easier for her.  </p><p>Didn't Vicky seem so much more excited when she was prescribed with her own glasses for the first time? She of course loved wearing Danielle's glasses but getting her own glasses was like she was vindicated for wearing glasses because she actually needed them. Don't you agree?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2016, 09:32</p><p>So name name what you're saying is that you're improving this site by calling a post made by "Carrie" as "bullshit"? And if anyone says anything otherwise we are arguing with your point of of view? Yep that really makes perfect sense to me. It's okay for you call anyone you don't like a fake or to accuse them of using other names or making up stories. So by making it better what you mean is that you want to be the judge an jury.  </p><p>Actually i'm sure your right that there have been and still are fakes coming in here. I have suspected several myself, but without real proof I am not going to accuse anyone of being a fake. I have been one that has stated more than once that I too wish there was a much better system of entering this site. Maybe your time would be better spent if you developed a better system to eliminate all the fakes instead of jsut accusing people falsely. </p><p></p><hr>

Sadly things have fallen to an almost irrepairable state.  If that's "arguing" to you, you should readjust your way of thinking.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2016, 16:49</p><p>My friend (friend of a friend) got her glasses on Monday afternoon. The frames are, as she said they would be, similar to her boyfriend's - plastic Ray Ban style. Just a bit smaller and more feminine. 1 pair dark, possibly black (Difficult to tell from the photos on Facebook), the other pair tortoiseshell.  </p><p>She wrote "Can't believe how clear everything close up is! It's like someone's cleaned the windows! Left eye is ok with far distances but right eye is a little out of focus with far distance but the optician said it will be clear in a few days as long as I wear my glasses all day. I thought that if I'm supposed to wear them all the time everything would be clearer straight away. Not with my sort of prescription it seems. The right lens magnifies so much more than the left. Shows how bad my right eye is. I asked the opticians what my prescription was and they showed me on their computer (and I also discovered I had a print out of it at home that they gave me when I had my eyes tested. I hadn't even looked at it!). My left eye is +1.00 and my right is is +2.50. I'm not really sure what that means. The numbers for each eye don't look very high or very different from each other but the right lens feels strong to me. Oh well. Officially 4 eyes now!" </p><p>That is quite a difference between each eye. The prescription for her right eye is the same as for my left eye so I have an idea what her vision in her right eye is like. In her photos on Facebook her right eye does appear to be slightly larger than her left but it's only noticeable if you keep comparing the left and right eyes. I commented on her post that her glasses suited her perfectly.</p><p></p><hr>

I have no idea how it was working just fine on Thursday the 25th of August and then on Friday morning the 26th not allow me access and only say I couldn't logon. Foe me it was like losing a good friend.  </p><p>Anyway back on topic. Yeah i'm sue you are wondering what her results might be&gt; I really hope she asks or that they provide her with what her prescription is in writing. I am willing to bet that even her left eye needs a stronger lens than the prescription of her bfs glasses. It's really good that she is at least getting used to wearing glasses all the time by wearing her bfs glasses. That will help since she is still likely to be shocked at how strong her right lens is going to be when she gets her own glasses. Even with her bfs weaker glasses she is already finding that she can't read very well without his glasses anymore and her glasses i'm sure are going to a good bit stronger than his. I wonder how long before she realizes that she won't be able to see distances very well anymore either without her glasses?  </p><p>By the way don't you love it when someone calls you a fake after you have been in here as long as you have? Most people with any common sense would know that fakes come and go rather quickly. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;10 Sep 2016, 14:47</p><p>Soundmanpt - I had noticed you hadn't been around on Eyescene but I presumed you were on holiday and didn't have internet access. </p><p>Yes her right eye must be a lot worse than her left so I suppose that her left eye has been doing most of the work close up for some time. I presume she hasn't had her eyes tested before if she had so little knowledge of eye tests. Maybe she thought they only check your near vision if you tell them you've had difficulty reading and only check your distance vision if you tell them you have difficulty with that. </p><p>She's not a close friend, rather a friend of a friend but we have known each other for a while. </p><p>I have never checked Facebook so much as I have over the last few days hoping to read that she has got her glasses. No news yet so I expect it will happen sometime next week.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2016, 22:26</p><p>Carrie </p><p>It's great to be back. My computer suddenly wouldn't allow me to logon.  </p><p>Anyway it seems a lot has been going on with your friend since you were at dinner with her and her bf. I guess not being able to see the menu when everyone else could must have been that final push to get her to go for an eye exam and glasses. So it would seem that she was only getting by, by being somewhat able to read with her left eye and most likely that eye has slowly been getting worse to the point where that wasn't working very well for her anymore either.I would bet that she probably even needs a stronger lens for her left eye than what she is seeing with using her bfs glasses. And her right eye must really be bad if his glasses are hardly any help to her. I think you're probably right that her bfs glasses must not be any stronger than +1.00 because she is wearing his glasses and she doesn't seem to be having any problems seeing things at a distance with them. If they were stronger I would think she might have some difficulty seeing distances wearing them. Interesting that she was surprised that the doctor also checked her distance vision which as you know they are always going to do anyway. Her distance vision maybe okay now but once she gets her own glasses and starts wearing them all the time her distance vision won't be so good much longer. Not surprising that she is somewhat excited about wearing glasses and at the same time nervous as well. If she has been wearing her bfs spare pair all week that should be a really big help to her when her glasses are ready. If she says that she feels like her eyes are even worse now than before when went for her exam that means her eyes have adjusted to her bfs glasses and i'm sure that she probably can't read anything now without his glasses.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2016, 10:59</p><p>My friend has posted on Facebook about glasses again. "Been wearing the boyf's spare glasses all day every day this week as suggested by him. I can see everything just fine with my left eye with his glasses on, especially reading but I can only get the right eye to focus up close if I really concentrate and keep the left eye closed. The glasses only help my right eye a little. Didn't realise how bad it was. I swear it wasn't so bad before my eye test. It's like it knows it's getting help next week and really can't be arsed to strain anymore. I hope the lens isn't going to be really thick! It's going to be weird wearing glasses all the time! It felt weird enough wearing the boyf's glasses for reading and then weirder still wearing them all the time this week but that is going to help me get used to wearing my own all the time. I am going to have to practice doing my makeup differently. The boyf said my right eye will be a bit more magnified than the left. I will try making the left eye seem bigger and then try making the right eye seem smaller and then I will stick with whichever method looks better. Obviously I will have to refine it once I get my glasses and see just how much my right eye is magnified. I feel really nervous now but there's no going back as I have paid in full and they have probably already started making the lenses so I can't cancel." </p><p>I commented that there was nothing to be nervous about and everyone is already used to seeing her in glasses because she has been wearing her boyfriend's glasses so won't get loads of 'You got glasses' comments as she has had them already &#128513;.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;02 Sep 2016, 17:46</p><p>Carrie, the advice given to your friend by the optician seems not unreasonable to me.

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;02 Sep 2016, 11:59</p><p>Update about the friend's eye test. She put up a Facebook post a few hours ago but I was at work so I have only just had a chance to check Facebook while Gemma cooks our tea. No wi-fi in the shop and I can only check my phone when I'm on a break anyway. I was too busy chatting during my break to check Facebook (as usual!). Anyway this is what she wrote - </p><p>"Had my eyes tested this morning. It went just how the boyf said it would. I could read up close so well with the test machine in front of me and the other chart that was projected on to the far wall wasn't too bad, slightly more difficult for my right eye looking through the machine than the left. At this point I was wondering why he was checking how far I can see when I only have trouble close up. Optician said my eyes are healthy and my left eye is slightly long-sighted but my right eye is a lot more long-sighted and I do need glasses. I was expecting him to say that and I expected him to then say "You should wear them for reading." Except he didn't. He said that because there is quite a difference between the left and right prescriptions he recommended that I wear glasses all the time! He said my depth perception will be better and my eyes will generally feel less tired. I picked out 2 frames. 1 similar to the boyf's if you've seen his and another one slightly different. I'll do a big reveal when I get them, which will be in a week to 10 days. Until then I can use the boyf's spare glasses because my left eye prescription is exactly the same as his (I took the glasses with me in case I had to read something, and the optician measured the lenses so he could get some idea of what power of lenses to start my eye test with he said. I told him I could read much easier with them) Both of the boyf's eyes are the same so his right lens will only help my right eye a little bit. Still can't believe I have to wear glasses all the time!" </p><p>She didn't put her prescription but I would guess her boyfriend's glasses are no more than +1.00 so her left eye is about that but it would be interesting to know what her prescription is. I wonder if her boyfriend minds just being referred to as "the boyf"?&#128513; She hardly ever puts his name in her Facebook posts, mostly "the boyf"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;31 Aug 2016, 10:09</p><p>The friend of a friend who had trouble reading the restaurant menu the other day posted a message on Facebook today "I seriously need reading glasses. Been wearing the boyf's spare glasses for the last week and a half and they really do help make everything sharper but now it's even more difficult to read without glasses. Very thoughtful of him to lend me his glasses. Might get some similar 'cos I look quite good in them, even if I do say so myself! Got some very nice comments at work when I put them on. Eye test booked for Friday morning so I can find out how sh*t my eyes are. Going to the same place the boyf has his eyes tested. He says they are really friendly and helpful and have a good selection of frames to choose from. He has told me that there is nothing to worry about and it's painless, just the puffer that tests the pressure in your eyes is very slightly uncomfortable. He also told me that once I get my reading glasses I won't believe how clear things are, it'll be even better than when I wear his and my eyes will feel more relaxed. I'm a combination of nervous, excited and looking forward to being able to see properly. The boyf is also looking forward to me getting my own glasses so he can get his spare ones back from me. He's worried they'll slip off my face and break. They are a little bit big for me but they only slip a little bit when I am reading and don't slip at all when I walk around with them on." </p><p>No photos of her in her boyfriend's glasses but it's good to read he is putting her mind at ease by explaining the eye test and telling her from personal experience how friendly the staff are.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;30 Aug 2016, 10:01</p><p>Vicky is younger than Danielle but a bit older than me. She has never been in a sexual relationship with a woman before Danielle, but has with men. She is very independent and was actually a challenge for Danielle. Playing hard to get to see how interested Danielle was. Danielle actually saw her as a potential girlfriend rather than a one night stand and really had to work her charm once she had established that Vicky might be interested in a date with a woman. Apparently Vicky secretly wanted Danielle to ask her out as she took a fancy to her straight away when Danielle walked into the coffee shop. They did not have sex on their first date and Danielle was quite romantic (she had no intention of attempting to get Vicky in to bed on the first date anyway). So she definitely wasn't preyed upon and actually Danielle was on the verge of giving up before Vicky agreed to go on a date. Danielle feels that Vicky's tactics made their relationship stronger. I doubt very much if Danielle would have succeeded in trying to get Vicky for just a shag. Vicky has never done that and had no intention of doing it. They both wanted a lover and that's what they got and they are very happy together. Vicky told me ages ago that parents were a little bit worried when they met Danielle for the first (she didn't look like the sort of person you would want to meet your mother. They probably thought she was going to rob them) but they are quite fond of her now. </p><p>Sorry this is off topic again but it really annoys me that someone is suggesting things about very good friends of mine that aren't true. Hopefully we can get back on topic now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2016, 11:32</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Your night out at the restaurant with your friends and partners seemed like a fun night and a good way to get together. I assume it is for "mood" that restaurants are so often dimly lit. Personally I hate it because actually I kind of would like to be able to see what I am eating and I never remember to bring my reader in with me and that makes it a real struggle trying to read the menu and even the bill which for some reason always seems like they ran out of ink several weeks ago and to make matters worse it is printed in blue ink which is even harder to see. Sorry personal rant. Anyway nice to know that even a young lady like you with your glasses on  had to wait for your eyes to adjust in order to read the menu. It probably just takes me longer for my eyes to adjust? But one young lady in your party clearly was having a much bigger problem seeing the menu. I assume she must either be in school or working but in better lighting she is able to see better. But she almost has to be straining even in good lighting. If her boyfriend's glasses were only okay for her left eye and too weak for her right eye she has been putting off getting glasses and she has to know she really needs them. I would think after what happened at dinner she will now be getting glasses very soon. If she was able to see nearly perfect with your glasses on for her right eye she must really only be suing her left eye when she is reading anything. I would be willing to bet that when she gets her glasses even her left eye is going to be stronger than her boyfriend's glasses. If you're friends with her on Facebook if she doesn't comment soon anything about getting glasses you might just have to give her a little push if you know what I mean. She's clearly been reluctant about getting glasses when i'm sure she has known for some time that she really needs them. I hope when she was using her boyfriend's or your glasses people told her how nice she looked wearing glasses. Those things can be helpful.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2016, 11:04</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I know you have been waiting and holing for that nice customer to come in again so you could chat with her. It's so easy to get a glasses conversation going when you notice that they are wearing new glasses. So you complemented her by telling her that you liked her new glasses. By the way do you really like her new glasses better than her first pair? I ask that because as i recall when she got her first glasses she got glasses that were similar to the glasses you wearing at the time. What do her new glasses look like? I mean are they a full plastic frame or semi-rimless? Anyway just as you thought her prescription changed and her glasses are indeed a little stronger than her first ones. Most of the time when someone gets new glasses it's because they needed a change in their prescription. Even better that she proceeded to tell you that her first glasses were only one something, so we can assume most likely -1.25 or maybe -1.50 and that she was only wearing them for distance. I am sure that she was probably starting to wear her glasses more and more often and also starting to notice that even with her glasses on things weren't as sharp as they were she first got her glasses. You didn't say what her age might be but I get the idea she is at least in her mid to late 20's. So her eyes aren't likely to change very much, but she was probably needing glasses for a while even before she got her first glasses. That can often mean that she was slightly under corrected with her first glasses. So it would almost be expected that she would need an increase after a year for sure. I'm sure she thought that even getting stronger glasses she would still just need them for distance. But once the prescription gets at or over -2.00 she really needs to be wearing her glasses full time. Not what she planned on but she doesn't seem to mind wearing glasses and your complement had to make her feel even better about wearing glasses now. I would not expect her to much more than maybe a very small increase of maybe -.50 next year just enough to sharpen things up for her.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2016, 09:45</p><p>Back on topic now. </p><p>The really nice, attractive female customer came into the shop on Tuesday looking really good and wearing the new glasses again. It wasn't busy so we had a quick chat (she's so lovely to talk to, I feel like she's a friend even though I don't know her that well). We chatted about holidays and also what each other had been up to since the last time we saw each other. I casually mentioned that I liked her new glasses. She thanked me and told me she needed a stronger prescription (as I thought). She was only going to wear them for distance like her old ones but after comparing her vision with and without the new glasses she decided she would prefer to wear her new glasses all the time. Without me even beginning to ask her what her prescription is she said "I think my old glasses are one point something and these are two or maybe two point something. I can't remember exactly but I do know I can see so incredibly clearly now!" </p><p>That was really good and now I now the next time I see her she is going to be wearing glasses again. </p><p>Last Saturday a whole bunch of us (old friends + partners) went out for a meal. The restaurant was quite dimly lit. The menus were handed out and after a few seconds your eyes adjusted to the low light and you could read the menu, although I could feel my eyes working really hard to focus. Perhaps I need a slightly stronger prescription. I managed to read the menu but I noticed that girl sat opposite me was really struggling to read it. She asked if anyone else was having trouble reading the menu like she was. Everyone said no. She said, sounding a little bit down, I think I need reading glasses then. Her boyfriend had just taken off his own reading glasses that he had used to read the menu. He offered her his glasses to try, which she did. At this point I became even more interested. She put them on and they did look good on her even though they were a little on the large size for her face. They were dark plastic Ray Ban style with quite a weak plus prescription. She had gone from someone who I found only very slightly attractive to someone I found very attractive. She tried reading the menu with the glasses and said it was much better especially her left eye. The right eye was still struggling. I said to her that maybe she needed a stronger lens for her right eye and passed my own glasses for her to try. She gave her boyfriend's glasses back to him and then put mine on and tried reading the menu again. This time it was much better for the right eye than it was with her boyfriend's glasses but not so good for her left eye unless she got closer to the menu than is normal for reading. My glasses (the frames called "Carrie" that I got about a year ago) looked ok on her as they were a better size but I feel that the style of her boyfriend's glasses looked better on her than the style of mine. Her boyfriend said to her that he is pretty sure she needs glasses and can borrow a spare pair of his until she gets her own. She admitted that she probably should have got glasses when she was still at school but has been able to see just well enough not to bother getting her eyes tested. She agreed that she really should get her eyes tested asap. </p><p>I don't see her very often as she's not a close friend, rather a friend of a friend but she seems pleasant enough and we are Facebook friends so I am more likely to read about her experience of getting her eyes tested and getting reading glasses on Facebook than hearing it in person. I am looking forward to reading that hopefully very soon.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2016, 08:33</p><p>To the anonymous person 17 Aug 2016, 01:11 </p><p>Danielle is 30 years old so it wouldn't be too surprising that she has had several sexual partners especially as Vicky is her longest relationship. She is also very attractive to gay/bi and bi-curious women and can be very charming with the ladies (actually a lot of men find her attractive despite her efforts to put them off) so can easily talk her way into someones bed. I suppose you could say she is a little bit dykey, if I must use that word. She has told me in the past that she would get herself checked regularly. Before she had sex with Vicky for the first time she got herself checked and so did Vicky. Both clean. She did not "prey" on Vicky. She took a fancy to her and tried chatting her up (after being distracted by me but luckily for Vicky I wasn't available) without knowing if she was into girls or not. Vicky is open minded and had never considered herself gay or straight or bi. She had never been in a same-sex relationship but did find some women attractive. She found Danielle very attractive and, as she was single at the time, decided very quickly that she would like to go on a date with her when Danielle asked her. </p><p>Sorry everyone else that this is off topic but I needed to defend my friend.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Omi</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2016, 06:27</p><p>Yesterday my boss asked me if i could do him a favor and pick his wife and dauhter and take them to the doctor because he got called in a last minute meeting. It turend out it was to take them to the eye doctor, his daugher around 16 and wife early 40s both wearing extremely high prescription glasses. So making some small talk with the wife she told me she flunked her eye exam for the drivers licence renewal. Waiting for them to get her eyes checked i chatted with a very nice girl with moderate minus. On the way back the girl was very dissapointed that her new prescription had jumped -2 to -14 her mother said to expect more as she was 42 and had just jumped to -22. A very exiting day for gwg fan. </p><p></p><hr>

The doctor had said it was only slightly stronger. Unbelievably she got out the two prescriptions and said " all the numbers have changed, I can't understand the difference". The first prescription was for +12 and +10 with +1.5 cylinder. The new one had reduced the spheres to +9 and +8, but with +6 and +4 spheres on approx the same axes. I could see why the child noticed the difference.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2016, 15:38</p><p>Yesterday evening my wife decided to sort through boxes still unopened from before she moved to my place 12 years ago. I watched the Olympics while she did so, and after about 30 minutes she came downstairs and said "look at what I found here". I was captivated by the cycling on TV, so I only gave her a brief look, but what a stunner! She had found several of her old pairs of glasses, that she wore as a teenager and young adult, which I had never seen before, and she had now put on wireless frames with thin golden temples. The lenses were, even if of much much prescription rhan she has today, substantially thicker that her current ones. She knows about my glasses fetish, so we spent the remainder of the evening fooling around with her in different pairs of older specs, quite a good time we had together!</p><p></p><hr>

Maybe it's also due to the wider frame, but the plus lenses seem incredibly strong,  early the strongest I've ever seen.

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;14 Aug 2016, 03:25</p><p>Soundmanpt - the woman's comments were a joke. She could see we didn't mind wearing glasses. Even Gemma doesn't mind wearing glasses so much now, but would rather have good eyesight. I'm not a big fan of aviator frames but they do look good on some women, Sonia the gorgeous French blogger and also the woman from Friday are the only ones I can think of at the moment. </p><p>Maybe the woman did wear her glasses full time after her experience with Danielle but she didn't say. It doesn't surprise me that she ended up in bed with Danielle as Danielle has this 'aura' that I have mentioned before that attracts gay/bi women.  </p><p>The nice customer with glasses is away on holiday. She came in to the shop a couple of weeks ago when I was on holiday and left a message with one of my colleagues for me. She will be away until next weekend so I probably won't see her until next Monday at the earliest. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Aug 2016, 19:59</p><p>Tom  </p><p>Thank you for respecting my freedom of speech. Yes I probably do post with some longer comment s than most and in the future I will try to cut them down some. But does it really matter anyway since as you say anyone uninterested in reading my comments can simply pass right past them.   </p><p>Just for the record if you look back in time in Eyescene you will find that there are only a few that have been in here longer than me. And in all that time I have only ever used my own name from day one. All these johnny come latelys can call me a fake but there is no reason at all I would ever bother doing that for so many years.  </p><p>As I have stated numerous times now Carrie and I are NOT the same person. I think because often times I am the first one to maybe comment to Carrie, good ol' Mr No Name being the bright guy that he is assumes that means I first post a comment as Carrie and then post a comment as myself. But the genius that he is has never bothered to notice how much time there usually is between our comments. The reason is simple. She is in the UK and I am in the US. There is a time difference of 6 hours between us so if she happens to post something at 10 AM her time it is only 4 AM here in the states and I am sound asleep at that time. Now of course if someone looks really hard they might find a time or two that if she posted something at say 3PM her time I might be still up and at my computer at 9PM and reply to her. But I don't think there are many to be found if any. At any rate I wouldn't ever bother going to that much trouble just to pretend to be someone else anyway. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;13 Aug 2016, 14:06</p><p>To the decider and others complaining about Carrie and Soundmanpt: nothing prevents you from NOT raeding what those 2 specific persons keep posting on this blog.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Aug 2016, 11:04</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Back on July 27th you mentioned about the nice attractive young lady that came to your aid when you were stocking shelves and a co worker was more interested in watching your boobs then help you. Anyway you noticed that this customer was wearing new glasses since the last time you had seen her in your store. So no surprise since I know you tend to notice someones glasses before anything else, that you noticed her new glasses appeared to be a little stronger than her first glasses were. She said that she was working out of her home and that she said she would be more often when your working. I take it you haven't seen her recently or you would have commented about it? You said you intend on trying to get her into a conversation about her glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Aug 2016, 10:52</p><p>Carrie </p><p>That's really quite funny.

And if Danielle at the time had rather short hair this woman probably did view her as a guy. It didn't help that when this woman heard the name Danielle she was thinking Daniel. But it didn't end up a wasted night for either of them as it turned out. In fact that woman it seems enjoyed sex with another woman enough that they saw each a few more times. Don't you think after that mishap this woman may have started wearing her glasses full time? Her parting comment to Vicky, Gemma and you wasn't necessary at all. She need not worry that the 3 of you would be too vain to wear your glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;13 Aug 2016, 06:23</p><p>Sorry for appearing to dominate this section but I have a sighting from last night. We were in a pub with Danielle and Vicky and I noticed an attractive woman who I guessed was in her late 30s to early 40s. She was wearing gold aviator style glasses with a prescription of around -4/-5. Danielle also noticed the woman and recognised her. "Sort of an ex." Danielle said. She went on to explain. At least 10 years ago she had gone to the same pub we were in now hoping to find a possible girlfriend or at least a one night stand. She was standing at the bar looking around the room when a woman came over and introduced herself and was very flirty with Danielle. They had a quick snog and a couple more drinks and the woman invited Danielle back to her place. Once they got there the woman took Danielle straight to the bedroom and they got undressed. Danielle said she was standing near the bed struggling to undo her bra and the woman was naked on the bed when the woman squinted hard and moved closer to Danielle and exclaimed "Oh my god, you're a woman! I thought you were a man called Daniel!" Danielle said she replied saying "My name is Danielle. Yes I am a woman, I'm really sorry if you thought I was a man. Would you like me to leave?". The woman thought about it for a few seconds and then said "I should have been wearing my glasses but I was too vain. We both went to that pub with the intention of getting a shag later on, we're both here now and both still want a shag. I've never been with a woman but if you show me what to do I'll try to pleasure you." Danielle said she wasn't going to miss the opportunity and they ended up having a great night. The woman was a quick learner! They saw each other occasionally for a few months after for "no ties casual sex" rather than proper dates. Danielle said "I think the phrase is "F**k buddies"." </p><p>If that woman had been wearing her glasses and was more sober she might have realised earlier that Danielle was not a man. Although, looking at photos of Danielle from the time she did look a bit boyish so I'm not surprised that the woman was mistaken. Danielle is more feminine now which I find more attractive. </p><p>As we sat chatting the woman saw Danielle and recognised her. She came over and greeted Danielle like an old friend, both of them saying how good it was to see each other after so many years. She said something like "I could see you properly this time because I actually wear my glasses so I don't pick up random women! If I hadn't been wearing my glasses 8 years ago I wouldn't have seen him!" (She pointed to an attractive man at a nearby table). She went on to ask Danielle how she was and then Danielle introduced us. Just before she went to join her boyfriend the woman looked at Vicky then Gemma and then me and said, jokingly "Don't ever be too vain to wear your glasses or you might get off with a man!" We all laughed at that.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2016, 21:32</p><p>Yesterday I saw 2 different people wearing what I was fairly sure was exactly the same frames. I was having a quiet evening walk with Gemma when I saw them. The first one was a girl of about 15 who was with a group of her friends of a similar age. I felt Gemma squeeze my hand as they approached. She still gets nervous when she see groups of people as it reminds her of the group of girls that bullied her at school. She had nothing to worry about with these girls. Only one of them was wearing glasses and the frames were very similar shape and colour to these <a href="http://www.selectspecs.com/glasses/kurt-geiger-london/kgs005-imogen/ss4386.05.html" target="_blank">http://www.selectspecs.com/glasses/kurt-geiger-london/kgs005-imogen/ss4386.05.html</a> with a minus prescription that was probably around -3 to -4. </p><p>A few minutes later, also walking in the opposite direction to us, there was a man and a woman in their mid to late 20s who were obviously a couple. Both quite attractive (I may be far more interested in women than men but occasionally a man does stir something) but it was the woman that really caught my attention. Not only was she attractive but she was wearing a pair of glasses that looked incredibly similar, if not identical, to the ones that the teenage girl was wearing. The only obvious difference to me was that the woman had a plus prescription that looked around +2 as they looked weaker than mine but not much. The couple smiled and said a polite and friendly "Hello" as they went past and we did the same.</p><p></p><hr>

The pay isn't brilliant but it's not that bad either.

Also Carrie has said that she is in the UK and I am in the US if you want to be so damn smart start looking at the times that Carrie and I post.

<p><b>chrisb</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2016, 13:23</p><p>Tonight at Sainsbury's self service checkout, a tall thin, slightly goth looking girl, mid to late 20's. She was wearing largish rectangular frames  back metal and perhaps a bit too much makeup. When  the checkout rejected one of my items she came over to sort it (self service checkout attendant must be the most boring job in the world). </p><p>Thank you I say, then 'nice glasses'  (more than a slight minus rx) I think. Looking fully at me, she replies with a deprecating shake of her head. 'Oh do you think so',  these are new and i hate wearing them. I've only had to have glasses for 2 years (ago) and my old pair were rimless but my prescription got stronger. It wasn't so bad  when people didnt notice I had them. </p><p>I am thinking 'Oh another case of late onset myopia'. </p><p> </p><p>I then realise from her accent she is eastern european or Romanian probably the latter. </p><p> </p><p>No, I say, you look very nice, the complement your look.  </p><p>Oh she says, they dont seem to, i am still single,,,, at my age. </p><p> </p><p>At this point she drifts off but comes back as I am finishing giving me an opportunity to reopen the conversation. </p><p> </p><p>"You do realise," i say, "that more than 51% of men prefer women with glasses than without. " </p><p>Oh, she replies, someone else told me that but I said it was rubbish. </p><p> </p><p>'No, you should believe it, its been surveyed properly' </p><p> </p><p>She smiles and I again say she looks very nice. </p><p> </p><p>No she says, I still dont believe it, I've been wearing glasses for 2 years now, and  its done me no good I am still single. </p><p> </p><p>I am then trying to decide whether to say "well I would invite you out for a drink anytime (even tho I am possibly old enough to be your grandfather.)  </p><p> </p><p>Still with a lovely smile, she then adds 'oh my goodness, but I never wear them when I go out in the evening'. </p><p> </p><p>The only answer is 'Well thats the problem then, you must wear them out.' .  </p><p> </p><p>She's thinking about this but to attempt to close (as a salesman would say)   </p><p>'Look, I will be coming back here again at about this time in a few days or next week. You can tell me how you get on.   </p><p> </p><p>I leave looking back at her smiling  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2016, 17:46</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I of course was only joking and I should have added that he really should have been a gentleman and helped you after he put his tongue back in his mouth.  </p><p>Also the other day in commenting with Melyssa she didn't seem too thrilled about getting her eyes dilated because going out into the sun isn't much fun when you can't see. I know you said that you enjoy getting your eyes examined but have you ever had your eyes dilated and if so how much did you like that?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2016, 16:31</p><p>I could see the funny side of my boobs knocking stuff over and I don't mind too much someone having a quick look at them as they do look big compared with my height. It was the fact he just stood there watching me struggle. A bit of teamwork would be nice. If I was tall I would be happy to help a shorter colleague. </p><p>Yes, that is the customer. I can't remember the last time I saw her. I will certainly mention her glasses the next time I see her. I am more sure now that her prescription is stronger.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2016, 16:09</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I hate to be the one to tell you but what guy wouldn't find it entertaining to watch your boobs knock off those rolls of paper towels I assume you were attempting to put up? I'm pretty sure Gemma doesn't have any problem with your big boobs. But really what's worse having nice big boobs or being height impaired? I better stop there while were still friends.  </p><p>Okay now is this the young lady that when she first came in she was with her husband and you were wearing your rimless glasses and she apparently really liked them and said that if she needs glasses she wanted glasses like yours? At the time she must have been about to get her eyes checked and was thinking that she might need glasses. The next time you saw her she came in alone and she was indeed wearing glasses, but I don't recall if she ever came back in other time or not? I'm not even sure if this is even the favorite customer your referring to? But if it is I think it has been at least a year since you last saw her so not surprising that her glasses appear to be stronger. I'm sure you're hoping she stops back in again very soon and you get a chance to chat a bit with her. I'm sure by you just saying "I see you got new glasses, I really like them" should open the door for a short glasses chat.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2016, 12:15</p><p>I was at work stacking shelves, or at least attempting to. I was trying to put some kitchen roll on shelf almost too high for me to reach but every time I reached up my boobs would knock things over on the shelf level with them (having big boobs can be a real pain sometimes). The only colleague who was free and could have helped was seemingly mesmerised by my boobs for a few seconds and then he just stood watching me while I struggled as if I was just there to entertain him. Before I had the to have a go at him a slim tanned woman with her hair tied back came from behind me and said something to him. I could see from the back she was wearing glasses which had a minus prescription. Still looking at my colleague she told me that he would finish off here and I was on a break now. The women turned round. She was gorgeous. Then I suddenly realised that the woman was the customer I referred to in my mind as my favourite customer! I hadn't seen her for ages. She recognised me and she took my arm and led me to a different part of the shop and she said how lovely it was to see me and asked how I was and how my girlfriend was (apologising for forgetting her name, I reminded her) and was very happy that Gemma and I are still very much together. She said she has been working long days and only managed to get to the shop in the evenings but has now began working from home and can do her shopping when she likes which is likely to be when I am working. Then she said she had better let me get back to work and she should do the same. She went off and paid for her shopping leaving me feeling very happy. Her glasses are different from last time. Large light brown frames. The prescription looked stronger than I remember, as there was a small cut-in now whereas I think the cut-in was barely noticeable before. As I am likely to see her more often now I will try to casually find out if her prescription is stronger and if she is still just wearing them for distances. </p><p>I don't know what she said to my colleague but he was very apologetic and very helpful for the rest of the day. Also, I have never seen someone make such an effort not to look at my boobs. I deliberately showed more of my cleavage and stood quite close to him at one point (I am very petite and he is quite a bit taller than me) and I could see he really wanted a quick look but he just looked everywhere else except down. He didn't even look me in the eye! It was a bit cruel on my part but serves him right.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2016, 09:45</p><p>Carrie </p><p>No not really monovision, but much the same way monovision works. As to your question as to why she needs prisms in her glasses if she is only suing one eye to see distance and the other eye to see close up? But she is still actually using both eyes to see distances and both eyes to see close up. The eye that she wears the plus lens over is using the plus prescription for distance and is correcting her vision in that eye. But that lens is more useful to her for seeing up close. And her nearsighted eye is of course being corrected for distance but her eyes by now are so adjusted to her glasses that her distance lens is helping her see close up as well now. So even though her lenses are opposite each other completely they still need to function together. Hence the need for prisms.  </p><p>I'm sure now that she's had a couple increases since she started wearing glasses she's not very happy about her ever worsening eyesight. If I recall when she got her first glasses she seemed quite excited about getting glasses. She started wearing them all the time even though they were actually very weak. She had to enjoy all the attention she was getting because she was now wearing glasses and from what you said when she started working their she was already getting a lot of attention from all the guys working their even before she got her glasses. Her glasses were helpful to her but far from necessary because she was able to see quite well without her glasses, just better with them. Now however when she takes her off glasses off her vision has to be more than a bit blurry, maybe because she can't focus on anything without her glasses due to double vision she really notice how blurry things really are. I was wondering if you got a chance to try her glasses on. I had a feeling that once you had her glasses in your hands you couldn't resist trying them on. I'm sure you did feel like you were high on drugs trying to see with her glasses on. And feeling dizzy would be understandable as well. You may recall when you got your current glasses and was prescribed with just -.25 CYL in both eyes that I warned you that it would be possible for you to get that type of feeling when you first put your glasses on. But you never even noticed any effect from having astigmatism correction in your glasses. But she has quite a good bit of astigmatism in both eyes and anyone surely notice that very quickly by putting her glasses on. Even though I know you enjoy trying other people's glasses i'm sure you were happy to put your own glasses back on. Just be thankful that your eyes are pretty normal compared to how messed up her eyes are.  </p><p>As for her sister eyes and her need for glasses I think if one sister gets glasses the other sister is likely to need glasses as well. Most likely she is a bit like her sister in that her astigmatism numbers were probably on the high side when she got her first glasses. Seldom does SPH cause headaches. Many opticians and doctors will recommend that you wear your glasses full time for the first 2 weeks so your eyes get adjusted to your glasses. That way at the end of the 2 weeks you can determine much better what and when you need to wear your glasses. She may have been surprised that at the end of the 2 weeks of wearing her glasses that she needed to continue wearing them or she would get a headache. Her headache was without any doubt due to her astigmatisms.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2016, 09:43</p><p>I was going to write this last night after my previous post but I was so tired and a little bit drunk I was virtually falling asleep!  </p><p>Danielle, Vicky and Gemma met me at work just as I was about to finish my shift. Like before they were wearing their prescription sunglasses when they came in, all looking cool and sexy. A male colleague said I should encourage my hot friends to come to the shop more often! Gemma and Vicky changed to their regular glasses while Danielle just took her prescription sunglasses off. My colleague and friend, the one with the prism prescription, seemed very pleased to see Danielle saying "She's so cool". I don't know if Danielle heard her but she gave her a smile. Danielle headed over to the wine section and picked up a bottle to look at the label. I saw her look very hard at it for a moment before muttering something quietly. She put the bottle down and got her glasses out of her bag. "Just can't read a bloody thing without them!" she said pointing to the glasses that were now on her face. Sort of mildly annoyed and sort of laughing about her eyesight. She kept her glasses on as she selected a few more bottles and brought them up to the checkout. I had finished my shift by then and we said bye to my colleague before heading off to my flat with all of us wearing our prescription sunglasses looking like an all female version of the cast of Reservoir Dogs <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=reservoir+dogs&amp;prmd=ivsn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVxNC72InOAhVMORQKHYMADb0Q_AUIBygB&amp;biw=960&amp;bih=600#imgrc=-AXynYom-el4VM%3A" target="_blank">http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=reservoir+dogs&amp;prmd;=ivsn&amp;source;=lnms&amp;tbm;=isch&amp;sa;=X&amp;ved;=0ahUKEwiVxNC72InOAhVMORQKHYMADb0Q_AUIBygB&amp;biw;=960&amp;bih;=600#imgrc=-AXynYom-el4VM%3A</a>  </p><p>We sat in my little garden chatting and drinking. Gemma made some lovely food. Sunglasses stayed on until the sun went down and we went inside to continue chatting and drinking (we didn't want to disturb the neighbours, especially my parents). Regular glasses back on(apart from Danielle again) we continued until the early hours of this morning when we couldn't stay awake any longer. </p><p>This morning we were feeling a bit delicate and Danielle was wearing her regular glasses and just an over sized t-shirt when she came in to the bedroom where Gemma and I were still in bed.(very nice to see first thing in the morning) She plonked herself on a chair and said quietly "Good morning. I knew you weren't shagging because it was too quiet!" Cheeky but true. After we had all showered and dressed we had coffee and breakfast and Danielle was wearing her glasses again. Gemma asked her why she was wearing her reading glasses. Danielle replied "I hate to admit it but it does feel more comfortable to wear my glasses when I'm tired or have a hangover." Gemma said/asked "You wear prescription sunglasses when you aren't tired or hungover, do you think you might need to start wearing your glasses all the time?" Danielle said she could do but doesn't feel the need to just yet. She wears prescription sunglasses because they are the only sunglasses she has. </p><p>She took her glasses off a bit later after the effects of the night before had worn off and her and Vicky headed home.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2016, 17:24</p><p>Soundmanpt - you think her glasses are monovision? I hadn't thought of that. But why would she need prisms if she was using one eye for distance and the other for close up? As far as I am aware she uses both eyes for distances and close up. </p><p>She's still OK about wearing glasses but I think she was a little bit down at first about her prescription increasing again. She's said she can still see without her glasses on but it's a bit blurry which makes the double vision seem worse because she isn't focusing on something. I tried her glasses on and it was what I imagine taking an illegal drug must be like! I felt quite dizzy. </p><p>Her sister is actually long/far sighted with astigmatism and no prisms.I remember her saying, when she got her first glasses, she thought she was only going to need them for reading and was rather surprised when the optician advised her to wear them all the time for a couple of weeks to get used to them. She was even more surprised that she found she needed to continue to wear them full time after getting used to them. She would get a slight headache if she didn't. I don't know what her exact prescription is or what her new glasses look like as I haven't seen her for ages. All I know is that she also got a stronger prescription. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Jul 2016, 07:37</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I'm sure your probably right that her doctor fitted her with glasses that were weaker than she really needed for her first glasses so it would be easier for her eyes to adjust to them. And of course her eyes have also probably gotten a bit worse as well along the way. You work with her, has she ever complained to you about having to wear glasses? From what I recall in your past comments about her she seemed to embrace the idea of wearing glasses without any problem as soon as she got them. But I don't think she expected that her eyesight would become so bad that she wouldn't be able to see without glasses anymore.  </p><p>Funny thing when you posted about her handing you her glasses to hold while she was switching to her sunglasses what you think her current prescription is now, that the only thing she didn't have in her glasses was a bifocal add. But it occurred to be that actually because she is minus in one eye and plus is the other in effect she is wearing mono vision which is what many wear instead of bifocals. </p><p>Am I right about her sitter getting glasses about a year after her? I don't think her sister's eyes are anywhere near as messed up as her sister's eyes are as I recall I think you said she was only nearsighted. Hopefully she doesn't have prisms in her glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2016, 23:02</p><p>Soundmanpt - Maybe her optician has gradually increased her prescription to help her get used to it. She probably wouldn't have been able to handle this prescription as her first. Quite a complicated prescription. It seems that the only thing missing is bifocals as she already has plus, minus and astigmatism!&#128512;</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;19 Jul 2016, 17:40</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Actually she hasn't been wearing glasses all that long for her eyes to be so messed up. I'm sure when she got her first glasses as weak as they were that she wouldn't ever get so bad that she couldn't see without her glasses anymore. Now you and I both knew that because she had prism correction in her glasses that she was destined to be wearing glasses full time to keep from seeing double. But her glasses are much stronger than I would have guessed they would ever become. Suggesting thinner lenses should help make her glasses look better. But as I recall her wearing glasses hasn't done anything to make her any less attractive to the guys where you work.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 16:39</p><p>Soundmanpt - My friend from work says that her eyes seem really bad without her glasses now. I happened to mention that both Gemma and me would get thinner lenses if our prescriptions went up. She said that the assistant at the opticians store asked if she wanted thinner lenses but she declined as she thought they were just trying to get more money out of her. She will definitely get thinner lenses next time, especially if her prescription goes up, and is thankful that the lenses don't stick out any more than they do in her current glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Jul 2016, 16:54</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Am I right that the girl from work you're referring to is the one that when she first started working with you didn't even wear glasses? You said she was really quite attractive and all the guys around work were hot for her. Then she got her first glasses which were pretty weak but she did have prisms in her glasses right from the start am I right? Not too long after that her sister got glasses and even came by work to show her sister her new glasses? If you're even close to right about her prescription her eyesight is really a mess now. I can't even imagine how things must to her when she had her glasses off. You did mention several times about her getting increases and new glasses. That thickness you saw was most likely the prisms that you were noticing. If you had taken your glasses off and put her glasses on i'm sure her glasses would have felt extremely weird to you with one lens being a plus and the other one a minus lens and then she has quite a bit of astigmatisms as well. Whenever she gets new glasses i'm sure she has to wait a while to even get them because of the complex lenses she needs.  </p><p>Thanks for the update on Danielle and Vicky. Danielle is an interesting young lady. She's trying so hard to only wear her glasses when she absolutely needs them because she doesn't want her eyes to become dependent on them. In other words she doesn't want to wear her glasses full time. However she doesn't seem to mind wearing her prescription sunglasses quite often. Now we all know that prescription sunglasses are much better quality than most off the rack non prescription sunglasses, but if she is really so worried about becoming dependent on needing her glasses full time she is going about it the wrong way. For just hanging out when she isn't reading anything she could be wearing non prescription sunglasses. But you're not about to tell her that because you really want her to wear her glasses full time anyway. So just look at it this way, the more you see her wearing her sunglasses the closer she is getting to full time wear. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;16 Jul 2016, 12:03</p><p>Earlier this week, after work, I was with my friend from work - the one with the prism prescription - and she wanted to change from her regular glasses to her prescription sunglasses. She only had the case her sunglasses came in with her so had to take them out before she could put her regular glasses away. She took her regular glasses off and handed them to me to hold as she put her sunglasses on. I took the opportunity to have a quick look at her glasses. There was the expected slight minification in the minus lens at the slight magnification of the plus lens as well as the stretching/distorting effect of the astigmatism prescription. What was noticeable was the thickness of the lenses - one lens was sticking out the back of the top of the frame and the other was sticking out the back of the bottom of the frame. I presume this is caused by the prism. I remember her saying when she got these glasses that all the numbers in her prescription had gone up by 0.5 and if that included the prism her prescription would now be (based on her previous prescription that I had copied and posted on Eyescene back in December 2014) R Sph -1.00 Cyl -1.50 Axis 95.0. L Sph +1.50 Cyl -1.75 Axis 83. Below that it says RPrism V-Dist 2.50 Down. LPrism V-Dist 2.50 Up. </p><p>She put her sunglasses on and I gave her regular glasses back for her to put away in the case. </p><p>As I am on the subject of friends, just thought I would mention that my friend Danielle still only wears her glasses for reading and close up but does wear her prescription sunglasses quite a lot now we are finally getting some sunny weather here in the uk. She looks very cool and sexy wearing them and knowing they are prescription gives me an extra little thrill. Her girlfriend is still wearing the low plus with low astigmatism prescription glasses full time. She has also been wearing prescription sunglasses a lot. While she is very attractive she doesn't have the same effortlessly cool and sexy 'aura' that Danielle seems to have. </p><p>My own sexpot, Gemma, looks irresistible in her prescription sunglasses and I really struggle to control my urges when she puts on her bikini to sunbathe in the garden! Yes, I know I go to bed with her every night but seeing her like that in the garden is a rare summer treat. We've been together for over 5 years but never had sex outside. Anyway, enough about that or I'll get moaned at for going off topic!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2016, 08:26</p><p>I don't often post on this page but I had an interesting sighting on Saturday evening of all places, church. Because I have a bad knee I always get their way too early because I want the closest parking spot. Like many others I am creature of habit so I always sit in the 2nd to last row in the far back corner. As usual there wasn't anyone anywhere close to me. But just  a few minutes after I got seated a mother and her 2 teen daughters came and sat 2 rows in front of me. I go every week and this was the first time I ever saw them in church.  Mom was quite attractive and she was wearing a pair of nice looking glasses that suited her very well. I could see that her glasses was to correct her nearsightedness. But her lenses looked thin and I don't think they were very strong. The girls just sat there very quietly as mom started to read the church bulletin. She suddenly stopped and she took off her glasses. She held them noticing a spot or smudge or something. As she was holding them she was starting to look in her bag for something to clean them with. Then the older of the 2 daughters suddenly reached over and took her mom's glasses away from her. It was clear that she must either have glasses herself or she has cleaned mom's glasses before. She knew too hold the glasses by the bridge was the best way to clean glasses. She proceeded to pull out a cloth I think just a hanky and started cleaning them. Every few seconds she held them up to check if they were perfectly clean. Judging by how wiping she was doing I have a feeling mom's glasses had more than one smudge on them. Mom sat patently waiting for her to finish cleaning her glasses. When she was finished a nice surprise she put the glasses on as if she was going to wear them. Mom gave her that mom look of disapproval but she only smiled at her and kept the glasses on. Mom never said anything and only watched her daughter as she testing her eyes by looking off in the distance and then pulling the glasses down her nose slightly. The other daughter was just quietly giggling at her sister. She finally took off the glasses and handed them to her mom. I heard the daughter say tell her mom how much she likes her glasses. Her mom replied telling her that "it looks like were going to have to see about getting you some glasses", The daughter just smiled back at her. I am hoping they are maybe new to my church and I will see them in the future to seeif the daughter in fact does get glasses or not. The problem is our church is very large and they have the one mass on Saturday evening but they have 6 masses on Sunday including an evening mass. It's possible they usually go on Sunday normally. This was nice for me because mostly older people attend that mass. Never very many young people in there.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>aviator -oo-</b>&nbsp;10 Jul 2016, 13:43</p><p>My same friend with a RX of -4.5 is still staying with me. Today we went for a walk, and then mid-way I reminded her that we should talk to someone who we were expecting to see en-route. Only then did she say "I haven't got my eyes in" and asked if I would help her to identify the person when I first spotted him. I think that's quite adventurous but she seems quite happy to be in blur, and I have never noticed her squinting.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>cubicle</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2016, 08:55</p><p>Interesting sighting in the subway, a young woman chatting on her phone, and wearing glasses.  </p><p>The lenses were fairly large and thick heavy plus, around +8, in a frame not designed for heavy lenses. So the poor girl's glasses were sliding way down her nose every 5 seconds. Had she missed a pushover or someone bumped into her, they would have fallen over.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2016, 05:34</p><p>To Swapn: interesting story. </p><p> </p><p>Reminds me of an aunt whose glasses also used to slip down her nose, especially when it was hotter or she was cooking for example. We're talking 25 years ago, when lenses were thicker and heavier than today. She was very good looking but had those large round brownish plastic frames, and a chain attached to the earpieces to "break" the fall of her glasses when they totally slipped off, or when she let them dangle off her neck. She must have been around 40y bold back then. I once asked whether it wasn't annoying that her glasses always slipped, and she had to push them back so often, but she said no, she was so used to it. I always felt attracted to her because of her thicker glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2016, 03:19</p><p>Had to catch a very early flight yesterday morning, and many young families with kids waiting for boarding at the gate areas. Among them several beautiful young moms in glasses, more than on average, probably because of the early hour, having to rush to get the kids ready and thus easier to put on glasses than contacts, also with a flight ahead an the dry air on airplanes. </p><p> </p><p>I picked a seat nearby a very attractive blonde, in short pencil skirt, high heeled sandals, and wearing thin ocean blue plastic frames showing noticeable power rings. I'd say she must have been around -5 or a bit stronger. Probably  a regular contacts wearer as she was also gently squinting with her specs on when focusing on distant objects or people. She took off her glasses every few minutes, fiddled with them, rubbed her eyes, put them on again, then off to clean the lenses, back on, adjusting them, off and leaving them on her knees for a while, then squinting real hard to see where her kids were but quickly resolving to use her glasses again as she was obviously unsatisfied with what she could (not) see bare-eyed. Quite a show early in the morning!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>swapn</b>&nbsp;05 Jul 2016, 19:22</p><p>I n India it's quite bit difficult to be with glasses wearing girl. But I have an aunt. She is now in her 30s and married. Last night there was a function at her home so she invited me to help her.  I went there and we did all, decorated her house. She wear glasses which maybe of -6.00 proscription,  she needed them but she never wear thwm full time as I know. But now she was wearing them.  During whole doing her glasses kept constantly sliding down on her nose. And she kept pushing them up. Finally we done. She said I would like to show you my new saree which I will wear tonight. We sat together and she showed, e her new saree. I kept looking at her thick glasses.  I asked her aunty why do you wear glasses you never wear it before?  She said I needed them so long but I didn't wear. So now prescription has been increased so I need it every time.  I asked her to show me them, she removed them slowly and gave me. They were pretty thick. And my aunt was squinting. I asked aunty can you see she said not so much. I gave them back and she felt relaxed. ?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2016, 15:45</p><p> </p><p>This phenomenon is called 'anisometropia' - one eye is nearsighted, the other one is farsighted. </p><p> </p><p>Also with relatively weak prescriptions, it is difficult to have a good vision sufficient for everydays requirements. So these people have it often from childhood on, and they are mostly fulltime wearers.  </p><p> </p><p>This comes often together with other inequalities, e.g. different size of the eye. </p><p> </p><p>Very often, they had one eye patched as children. And, they are the lucky ones, as their parents or teachers discovered these shortcomings. The less fortunate ones developed a 'lazy eye' (the strong eye not patched), and one day at the age of ten or twelve it was too late for the development of the weaker eye (amblyopia then). </p><p> </p><p>Most of us have a low anisometropia, that is an existing difference between the two eyes (e.g. R -2.00 / L -2.50 etc.). But anisometropia around zero (one plus, one minus) are interesting cases.  </p><p> </p><p>Some very old people claim, that they would not need glasses - they typically have one eye around zero or with a weak myopia, and the other eye hyperop at 2.50 or 3.00 - during their lifetime.

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2016, 15:06</p><p>Interesting sighting at the weekend. A girl in her mid to late teens wearing large plastic frames in dark purple. One lens was around +2 and the other was either no prescription or very very weak minus. I'm pretty sure she was a full time wearer as she was wearing them the whole time I saw her - only a few minutes but she wasn't reading anything.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2016, 06:16</p><p>Just had an amazing couple of sightings that have left kind of weak at the knees. </p><p> </p><p>Hot young brunette, probably about 5ft 2in, mid 20's slender frame with long hair. I walked past the bus stop and noticed her thick lenses in her Ray Ban Wayfarer's that were sticking out quite a bit from her frame - they are probably the most noticeable protuding lenses I have seen in a while, at were protuding by at least 3/4cm. I stood beside her looking at the bus stops hoping she may look at me and I could then maybe start up a conversation, but alas, she was very focused on the stops and times of the buses, and adjusted her glasses a little presumably to focus on the small print, pushing her glasses up against her eyes. She then walked off and sat down on the bench at the bus stop which was crammed full of people so chance of making subtle small talk. Damn. </p><p> </p><p>Second sighting was only a few minutes later when I walked out of a shop having bought lunch and saw a stunning tall blonde, probably early 30s with her long hair held up in a pony tail, wearing a preppy outfit of white buttoned shirt slightly unbuttoned, with a blue sweater drapped over her shoulders, and skin tight jeans with boots. She wore stunning big round horn rimmed / light tortoise style print glasses with quite a few power rings going on in her frames. Maybe a -6/-7 and was looking helplessly at her phone, looking lost. I glanced at her momentarily from a few paces away as her utter beauty stopped me in my tracks as she gazed up and down from her phone into the distance, I was wondering if she was looking for directions to somewhere but the moment passed :( Carpe dieum has never been my motto unfortunately!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2016, 08:31</p><p>murky </p><p>Sounds like you had a nice encounter? Perfect timing with complementing her on her specs since she has only had them for 2 weeks. The fact that she has gotten lots of complements has to make her feel good about wearing glasses. Interesting that she was only wearing her first glasses for close work and apparently she must have gotten her eyes examined before getting new glasses, which is always a good idea, and her eyes must not have changed much if at all according to her. But there is no doubt that her bf wants her to wear her glasses all the time now. A good question you could have asked her is if her distance vision has cleared up or if things at a distance are still a little bit blurry? Most likely as you were talking to her, she was still adjusting to them for distance. But of course you only had a few seconds to chat with her before a customer came along. She didn't get a chance to answer you if her bf prefers seeing her in glasses? But I think you already knew the answer anyway.   </p><p></p><hr>

He always wore strong glasses, perhaps minus nine. One day he appeared in glasses with a very weak prescription, -1.50 or so. As it happened, we had a talk about some business problems and at the end I complimented him about his new glasses, saying that they looked quite different than all his previous glasses. He smiled (a bit shy) and then told me that he really needed progressive glasses but was unhappy with the idea. He then explained that he got contact lenses at his Rx for close work and that the glasses were just for the finishing touch in the long distance. "I'm experimenting a bit, you know".

<p><b>aviator -oo-</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2016, 15:41</p><p>I have a friend, female, about 50. I know her distance prescription to be -4.50 in both eyes. She usually wears contact lenses but, on visiting the bathroom, I noticed that she has contact lenses with both -4.5 and -3.5 power in her wash bag. She also has three pairs of glasses. The first I know to be -4.50 L+R. The second are 'readers' (approx +1.00) which she wears 'over' her contact lenses. The third pair have moderate minus lenses, which I have noticed her wearing to read close-up when she doesn't have her lenses in. I assume these to be -3.50. The one thing she is missing is some frames with a -1.00 RX to enable her to see well long distance when she has her -3.5 lenses in.  </p><p> </p><p>I have often come across people with a range of different glasses, but never before a choice of different powered contact lenses.

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2016, 01:45</p><p>Interesting glasses reference at work - an ex client was looking to place some more business our way having worked with us a couple of years. She is in her early 20s, Greek and very charming and personable with seemingly expensive taste. When we worked on a project previously we had to stay overnight in a hotel and when I went into her hotel room for a chinwag I saw a packet of contact lenses with a remarkably strong prescription of +7.75. Wow I thought but could never think of broaching the subject, and I never saw her in glasses (probably not surprising given how strong her glasses would be). It was so nice to hear from her out of the blue a couple of weeks ago and we met up to go over work matters then went for a few drinks. We both have the same breed of dog so we agreed to go for walks with them sometime soon. </p><p> </p><p>On a follow up call yesterday and today she has organised a couple of her colleagues to meet with me to look at a couple of potential deals and when I asked for their name she texted me saying "the one without glasses is ... and the one with glasses is..." I texted her back saying "nice detail reference" wanting to acknowledge this reference but not be overtly detailed on but was surprised that someone would point that out! I'm meeting them in 45 minutes so I'm intigued to see if these glasses are a standout piece.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;21 Jun 2016, 05:47</p><p>On Sunday MAin St in Vancouver was closed to cars between 12th and 30th street and there were vendors and performers set up along the curbs. People were milling about in abundance, and since there is a fairly high Asian population there were a number of fairly attractive young ladies who's racial backgrounds were very diverse. I enjoyed myself immensely with the wide range of viewing. There was a wide variety of the learger frame sizes and styles that are popular today and there were some reasonably strong prescriptions for my viewing pleasures.  A pretty young lady wearing attractive looking frames is still pretty, but a pretty lady wearing the wrong pair of glasses can have her looks spoiled by her unfortunate choice. Sometimes it makes me wonder what the optician was thinking.  I really did wish that I had been able to wander about on my own, as I was only able to comment on the frame choice of one very pretty young lady wearing an oversized pair of 50's style gold cat eye glasses. They looked great on her and she told me that she had gotten them from our old friend Clearly Contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2016, 15:13</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I have been looking since Friday to see how your dinner went with your ex-bf and his gf. Sounds like you all enjoyed each others company. You did the perfect thin by complementing his gf on her new glasses. She is no different than any other young lady in that she loves getting complements on her looks which includes how she looks wearing new glasses. And of course in doing that she was almost certain to comment about her prescription changing. Both you and I suspected that was most likely the reason she got new glasses. When she says her prescription went up by one point she must mean it went up a full diopter which like you probably know is like going from say -1.00 to -2.00. That's not a terrible increase for a year, but it is substantial considering she should be nearing the age where her eyes really shouldn't be changing very much. It doesn't seem that it was that long ago when you first met her and she wasn't even wearing glasses at all. But one would suspect that she was probably already needing glasses then, but she may have been holding off. So did I do the math right that her new glasses are her 3rd pair of glasses? You would have think that her first glasses were most likely in the -1.00 range which is about when most get their first glasses. Once her eyes got more relaxed by wearing her first glasses it would make sense that when she broke her first glasses she would need an increase. Hearing both her and Gemma talking about how blurry everything is for them now when they take their glasses off had to be a bit of a turn on for you. Was she surprised that you are still much more able to see things in the distance pretty well without your glasses? But at the same time she should still be able to read small print without her glasses better than you can. Do you know what type of work she does? I mean does she do a lot of close things such as being at a computer all day? Things like that could be taking a toll on her eyesight. Anyway i'm sure you enjoyed yourself more ways than one that evening. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2016, 12:00</p><p>It was lovely having my nice ex boyfriend and his beautiful girlfriend over for dinner. As I thought, her prescription has gone up. I did manage to ask her about her glasses without sounding unusually interested. I complimented her on her new glasses and she thanked me and said her prescription had gone up again. She had noticed that she wasn't seeing so sharply so booked an eye test. Her prescription has gone up by one point, as she put it. So I subtly asked what her prescription was and she replied she is -4 in her worse eye and -3. something in the other eye. She said it's a bit annoying that the prescription has gone up every year but it does give her a reason to get some new frames. Gemma agreed with her and said her own previous prescription was about the same but is a bit higher than that now and thinks it might go up again at her next eye test. Our friend asked if Gemma found everything rather blurry when she took her glasses off even with the previous prescription. Gemma said yes, like looking through a camera that's focused on something near to it rather than further away. Our friend said "Yes! Just like that!" Our friend asked me what it was like for me without my glasses. I said it's like someone's tried to focus the camera on a distant object but hasn't quite got it. I went on to say that my distance vision wasn't as bad as hers or Gemma's but still annoying - I could get around for a bit if they suddenly broke or got knocked off - and then increasingly difficult to focus the nearer the object is. Our friend also said that she doesn't like the way the lenses stick out the back of the frame and next time she'll ask for the thinner lenses. Gemma said "Me too!". At this point my ex said, jokingly, "3 beautiful women and all blind as a bat!" Pretending (very poorly) to be offended I said "So you're saying we're all old bats?" He just replied sarcastically "Yeah." and then we all laughed and the conversation moved on. </p><p>So I estimate that my ex's girlfriend's prescription has gone by around -2.00 since her first ones, which she got a couple of years ago. I remember seeing her in her second pair that she got about a year after her first ones. She had broken her first ones and got her eyes tested before ordering new glasses just in case her prescription had changed. She got a stronger prescription then, so that was probably the previous one to this.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2016, 12:45</p><p>Carrie </p><p>In regards to the young lady that came into your store wearing glasses that you were doing your best to try a determine about what prescription might be. First of all you have gotten very good at being sneaky as well as good about making a pretty good guess about other peoples glasses. So I was trying to think of a way you might have been able to have a conversation about glasses with her. There is nothing wrong with simply commenting to her, "I really like your glasses" Followed by a "Are they new"? and then "May I ask where you got them from"? Coming from another glasses wearer that wouldn't seem out of line at all. She would appreciate the complement i'm sure. After all you know much you like it when someone tells you they like your glasses. You know the very worst you would get is a thank you from her. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2016, 11:16</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I was wondering if you still were staying in touch with your ex-bf and his gf? It's really nice that after breaking up with him that you can still be friends and I think you both still care about each other just in a different way now. He was your bf when you first started wearing glasses and i'm certain that his support of you wearing glasses had to mean a lot to you back then. If he had not liked seeing you wearing glasses i'm sure that would have hurt you badly. So you have to know that when his new gf got glasses and started wearing them he was probably very supportive of her as well. If she got new glasses she almost certainly got her eyes tested and probably needed an increase which as you well know is usually what happens. If I recall the glasses you first saw her wearing were her first glasses and she went to full time not long after getting them. So she was probably in need of glasses even before she got them. This can sometimes result in her being slightly under prescribed and of course her eyes are probably still changing  bit as well. Your not Carrie I know if you don't ask her about her new glasses if she doesn't say anything about them on her own. I'm sure if you ask her if her glasses are new she will not only tell you probably provide you more details as well. Of course swapping glasses with will do neither you or her any good since she is nearsighted. Gemma's glasses are going to be too strong for her and hers will be too weak for Gemma. Sadly I doubt that she will know what her prescription is so you may have to guess. I know you said when you first met her that she was really very attractive before she got her glasses and knowing how your attracted to young ladies wearing glasses she has to be even more attractive to you now since she's wearing glasses. I look forward to a report tomorrow. Enjoy dinner. (which I know you will)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2016, 09:46</p><p>Just got back from work and I have got a little bit of time before I need to start preparing for dinner tonight so Gemma doesn't have so much to do. My last boyfriend (the nice ex boyfriend) and his girlfriend are coming over for dinner. We haven't seen them for a while so we invited them over. I know she has got newish glasses as she posted a photo on Facebook not long ago of herself wearing them. I can't tell from the photo if her prescription has changed as she is directly facing the camera and not close enough to it to see any cut- in. I sometimes forget he used to be my boyfriend as him and his girlfriend are so nice individually and as a couple they are just like some of our other straight couple friends. Anyway that's something I can look forward to seeing later.  </p><p>About an hour before I finished work today a very pretty brunette girl of about 18-20 came in to the shop. She wore brown or possibly tortoiseshell glasses that were sort of rectangular/square shape. As she had her hair up in a ponytail I could see through her lenses that they were a very weak plus with possibly some cyl. in them as well but difficult to tell for sure as it was only for a couple seconds from behind and about the same from the front before she moved on to another part of the shop. I was shelf stacking so I knew that would be the last I saw of her. If I'd been on the checkout I might have had a better look. Never mind, my own girl-with-glasses is much better looking anyway&#128525;.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2016, 17:40</p><p>murky </p><p>I'm glad you are using my line and finding that it really works to put a young lady at ease. The only problem is if your quite young saying that your retired might not work so well. Then you may be better off by saying that you used to work as an optician. I am 67 years old so easy to believe I would be retired by now. Just a suggestion here, I don't think I would say "they must be fun to wear" you may recall in one of your earlier encounters when you said that to the young nurse she seemed to get offended at that comment. In your description of her glasses you said they appeared to be a low minus, so it's very possible she hasn't been wearing glasses very long and she might even still be getting used to wearing them and to her they may not be so much fun to wear. Needless to say she didn't seem to like your comment. Probably better to stay with nice glasses, are they new or those glasses look perfect on you. By the way have you considered sending me a dollar for each time you use the line I provided to you? haha!</p><p></p><hr>

Greta seems very competent as she not only refracted your eyes from +1.00 to +1.25 glasses as well as finding your need for prism correction. Almost certain that they will increase your prisms from 4 BI, but I am not sure if they will want to go up to 10BI this fast since you have only had your glasses for such a short time they may feel like your eyes aren't fully adjusted to them yet. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2016, 09:37</p><p>Caroline </p><p>I had a feeling that Greta may not have taken the time to really explain to you that getting prisms is really a big difference than just getting a small increase in your glasses every so often. Prisms as your finding out has a much bigger effect on your eyes than just getting an additional +.25 added to your glasses every few years. For that reason Greta needed to really take a few extra minutes so you had some idea about what your eyes were about to go though. Apparently she didn't even mention that as your eyes adjusted more to your glasses you were soon going to be seeing everything with double vision when you take your glasses off. That is something you needed to know about before you got your glasses. I don't how or why she might think that your going to need 10 BO prisms at some point? I don't think there is anyway to predict how much you will end up with. But I don't think anyone will prescribe you with 10 BO right away. I'm pretty sure they will want to only increase that slightly as you need it. So I would hold off as long as possible but if you find that even with your glasses keeping things as one is getting too hard then of course you need to go for a checkup. I would think they will maybe increase you to 6 BO when you do go back. They are going to want to take things slowly.  </p><p>I agree with "Likelenses" even though your glasses will likely be changing in the near future you still really do need to get a pair of glasses as a backup. This is something you never had to worry about before because if you ever would have lost or broke your glasses you were able to see nearly as well without your glasses as you could with them. But your a nurse and i'm sure there have been times when you were working with a patient and they flopped their arms and accidentally almost almost knocked your glasses off or hot your glasses. Now if something were to happen to your glasses while you were working your double vision would make it impossible for you to see to work. I would suggest an inexpensive pair on line that you can keep in your car so they would be handy to get if you ever needed them. You've wore glasses for a long time have you ever lost or had your glasses get broke or any other mishap with your glasses? I'm glad this forum is providing you information as well as a good place to talk. Your daughter is still young enough that none of this would make any sense to her anyway. Prisms is hard enough to explain to someone that has some knowledge of vision. It isn't like being nearsighted or farsighted and not nearly as common. Even all your nurse friends which i am sure probably many of them wear glasses would not be of any help to you, but they being in the medical field they might find what you have to say about prisms interesting. But i'm sure you would get more questions than answers from any of them.  </p><p>You might be right about going over to the "Vision" thread.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Murky</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2016, 17:27</p><p>Went to the supermarket, to buy for evening meal, and loitered in the fruit &amp; veg section, where one can see all the new arrivals, and clear across the racks.  </p><p>A 20s woman appeared, with gorgeous red flared round the temples spex, largish arms, about -2 to 3  . Watched her for a bit, she was one of those naturals, looked better in glasses, we used to try and find them when I was briefly working in Advertising, some years ago,as 1/3 of women wear glasses, then 1/3 of our ad actors should wear them, but they must not be a distraction from the product, and most ( all) models don't like modelling with glasses, so its rare to see one in an Ad.  </p><p>Anyway, I walked up to her, and complimented her on the glasses, "Gee, thank you", she replied, and moved on. </p><p>Home via a bar and beer, and there, a 30s tall elegant woman, huge round black Tommy Hilfiger glasses, about -1, watched her for a bit,and an older bespectacled woman ( her mother) appeared, with green lucent acetate glasses,bifocals matching blouse, quite stunning,sat down THEN..both took off their glasses, and laid them on the table, mother was also also about -1, so both see better at close range bare eyed. I was going wild with joy at the next table. Waiting for one of them to return to the bar for a drink, then it happened, mother moved to the bar buy  drinks. Looking over there I cooed, "lovely glasses, well done both of you". She picked hers up, put them on, " thanks" was all I got, and proceeded to ignore me.  </p><p>Then, on the way to carpark, standing at the traffic lights, along came an 19-20 you, with gorgeous art noveau feathered brown half frames. nylon on the bottom, with wafer thin silver arms, rather oversize, stunning sighting, and low minus, less than one I estimate, probably mostly a fashion accessory..  </p><p>Said I "I love those glasses".  </p><p>Yours are pretty speccy too  " she replied, the lights changed, off to the car..  what an encounter..Evening TV was rather dull after that</p><p></p><hr>

I keep the prescription, so I can buy anything nice in the interim. </p><p> didn't take the time to really explain what prisms actually are and how they effect your  </p><p>No, you are correct, she just said, I think you will get some help from correction of your esophoria, to help your eye muscles.  I had never noticed a problem with double vision, although I could drift my eyes apart, when reading, quite easily, then pull the images back together. I would get more troublesome when tired, late at night, but I thought that was normal with tiredness. I does not occur now, although I can still drift them apart ( probably because I have 8/20 corrected). That why I wondered about going for 20, if that was not leading to even more esophoria. She said, I will correct about half your esaphoria.  </p><p>.. It seems the first time you really noticed something different about your glasses was when you said you were driving and took them off.. I'm assuming you were maybe taking your glasses off to put on sunglasses?  </p><p>I have photochromic tint, but it does not work behind the windscreen, so yes Soundman, I was going to put on my old sunglasses, and had no correction for about 15 seconds, till my eyes cam back together, with a little effort, as I had become used to having the prism. As S/M writes, all my lovely collection are obsolete now, over $6000 worth, but they can be reglazed, so will keep them, maybe start a museum, like crystal veil! </p><p> </p><p>Something you probably often did with your previous glasses. But being able to see to drive without your glasses was something you never before had any problem with since your previous glasses were never stronger than +1.00. So your glasses then were more necessary for seeing up close than for seeing distances. When this happened I am thinking that your eyes were probably tired so by taking your glasses off they weren't able to auto focus as fast as they needed to. </p><p>Yes, exactly </p><p> That is why your vision was off and you were seeing double. When your eyes are more rested they still were able to auto focus pretty quickly but now the more your eye are adjusting to your glasses the harder it is for them to auto ficus anymore. I'm sure taking a shower, of course without your glasses, seeing 2 cakes of soap was something new for you?  </p><p>Could see four feet as well!  Quite alarming, and felt a little unsteady, as balance was affected, probably through altered reflex eye stabilisation, as occurs after a carnival wild ride, or a spin on the swings.. </p><p>But i think from now on you can expect that more and more things your going to be seeing double without your glasses. And even with your glasses on when your eyes get relaxed you might be seeing double as well. That's clearly a sign that you need more prism added to your glasses, but you maybe able to hold off for a while or at least until it becomes a bigger problem to you. </p><p>Yes as I wrote, why not go for the lot,all 20, see better, be happier, and accept that glasses are there to help, as well as a fashion accessory! </p><p> Seeing a specialist is not a bad idea but they do cost more and really i doubt they will do anything different than Greta is already doing. Greta may not wear glasses (yet) but she seems like she is a smart cookie and knows her job very well. </p><p>Agreed, she made a diagnosis, worked out the solution, provided it to the patient, who took the medicine, evaluated it, it worked. Thats the hierarchical paradigm of health care we nurses use all the time,also called linear logic. </p><p> </p><p>I'm glad to see others are starting to provide you with advice now as well. </p><p>Its a fine thread, I am enjoying it, learning lots, and it helps to talk. I have only one daughter at home, and she is just not interested, and its not appropriate to discuss it at the hospital, so I like the forum. Maybe we should be on Vision I see there is prism discussion there too. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2016, 12:45</p><p>Caroline </p><p>It seemed pretty clear to me when we first started chatting that you didn't have any understanding exactly what you got added to your recent glasses when you got them. I had a feeling that either the lovely Greta didn't take the time to really explain what prisms actually are and how they effect your vision or you weren't paying a lot of attention to what she was telling you and didn't ask any questions. Even though you've had your current glasses for a little over a month the prisms have only started to have an effect on your eyes in the past few weeks. It seems the first time you really noticed something different about your glasses was when you said you were driving and took them off. You said it was terrifying because your distance perception was gone and the road was double. I'm assuming you were maybe taking your glasses off to put on sunglasses? Something you probably often did with your previous glasses. But being able to see to drive without your glasses was something you never before had any problem with since your previous glasses were never stronger than +1.00. So your glasses then were more necessary for seeing up close than for seeing distances. When this happened I am thinking that your eyes were probably tired so by taking your glasses off they weren't able to auto focus as fast as they needed to. That is why your vision was off and you were seeing double. When your eyes are more rested they still were able to auto focus pretty quickly but now the more your eye are adjusting to your glasses the harder it is for them to auto ficus anymore. I'm sure taking a shower, of course without your glasses, seeing 2 cakes of soap was something new for you? But i think from now on you can expect that more and more things your going to be seeing double without your glasses. And even with your glasses on when your eyes get relaxed you might be seeing double as well. That's clearly a sign that you need more prism added to your glasses, but you maybe able to hold off for a while or at least until it becomes a bigger problem to you. Seeing a specialist is not a bad idea but they do cost more and really i doubt they will do anything different than Greta is already doing. Greta may not wear glasses (yet) but she seems like she is a smart cookie and knows her job very well. Like you stated as soon as you first put on your current glasses your vision was very good instantly so she put you in glasses that were perfect for your eyes or you wouldn't have been able to see so well. Now that your going to be wearing glasses with prisms in them one thing you need to do for sure is be sure to keep any of the glasses that have prism correction in them separate from all your previous glasses that don't have the prisms in them. That's just in case either of your daughters would maybe decide to accept your offer of having any of your previous glasses. You don't want them to happen to like the way a pair of your prism glasses happens too look on them and choose those glasses to wear. The prisms would very quickly ruin their eyes and they would be seeing double like you without glasses. All your previous glasses you can sell or give away as they won't do any harm to anyone's eyes.  </p><p>I'm glad to see others are starting to provide you with advice now as well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2016, 11:44</p><p>Caroline,  I usually don't close one eye to see with my specs off, I hardly ever have them off aside from showering or sleeping and I could generally manage in the shower, even if I'm seeing double. My optometrist did mention something about vision therapy as well, but she said at my stage, it would more likely be done to make my prism correction more stable.  At the range I'm at, she didn't seem overly confident that eye exercises would eliminate my need for prisms.  If you have any other questions let me know.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>caroline</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2016, 21:07</p><p>Yes Brian, interesting stuff, and do you also close one eye sans specs, I am not at that stage yet, but under the shower last night, I had two cakes of soap! </p><p>If we think about it, when one goes to the doc with a weak muscles, you usually an exercise program, not a pair of crutches! If the exercises don't help then maybe so crutches, or an operation? I am an ED nurse, so know a few things here. </p><p>So if eye muscles are weak, which is why we strain to keep images together, then vigorous eye exercises are maybe a better way to in the long term.  </p><p>I find the prism so satisfying, at the cinema last night, for the first time post prisms its a pleasure to look thru them, and the world is just a better place to see. But I have 40 + years to live, and from the anecdotes here, I don't think the axes will stabilise, and we may just chase the tail. </p><p>I am thinking of getting an opinion from an ophthalmologist, or maybe an orthoptist, as they specialise in the mechanics of seeing. </p><p>So pleased that I came onto this site, with such supportive people. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2016, 12:33</p><p>Caroline,  I started at 2D Base In Prism in each eye back in 2010.. I had slowly increased to 5D Base In by 2013, thought it had stablized, but when I went back this spring, I saw another increase and am now at 6D Base In in each eye, so I have 12 total prisms.  The doctor for the 1st time this year, told me if it continues to increase I might want to consider surgery.  Like others, I am now completely dependent on the glasses to not have double vision. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2016, 10:21</p><p>Another beautiful day here in the UK (well it is where I live anyway). Some of my regular customers have come in to the shop wearing prescription sunglasses during the sunny weather. Some I know to be full time or part time regular wearers but some I have never seen wearing glasses before. There's 3 or 4 with mild/weak minus lenses and a couple of low plusses. One of the plus wearers I didn't know wore glasses is a quite attractive late 20s early 30s woman - one of the yummy mummys - so to see her in some prescription sunglasses was very nice and left me hoping she would come in wearing her regular glasses sometime. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Edmund</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2016, 08:23</p><p>Caroline, </p><p> </p><p>I have 8 BI prism per eye for the last 6 years.

I also find that when I do have my glasses off, I involuntarily close my right eye to stop the double vision.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>caroline</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2016, 21:26</p><p>Likelenses, </p><p>No no one noticed, but from my reading, 1 D of prism is less than a degree ( 1 cm @ 1 metre) and even 4 d would be hard to see. </p><p>Frankly I was so concerned, that I left the party, and called my daughter for the lift.

"There is no going back" as they say, but the issue of long term stabilisation at 10 years is not discussed.  </p><p>I am scanning the airports and supermarkets for people with high prism, comparing the Rx with lens thickness to try and detect it. Have not seen any in 3 days. Will be hard to spot, but a few family have commented on how thick my lens is, but its on the medial side, so can only be seen when I take my spex off, shower and bedside. </p><p>I now better understanding my Zing, its that the eyes are relaxed when looking, rather than working to keep images together.  </p><p>I think my ECP was pretty canny to detect it, prescribe, and the proof was that I walked into the first prismatic correction ( at total 8) a month ago, and have not looked back.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2016, 16:05</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I have no doubt that without your glasses your distant vision isn't nearly as bad as Gemma. Of course that's mostly because your need for glasses is completely different than Gemma's. But your still able to enjoy the fact that you can't see nearly as well as you can with your glasses. What I am trying to say is before you started wearing glasses you never got to enjoy seeing things out of focus. You only saw the world one way perfectly clear. Now you get the the option whenever you want by simply removing your glasses you get to see the world differently and Gemma even more so. Too many people just think that the only purpose of getting glasses I to see everything perfect which they do, but they also provide the opportunity to see things in a different way as well by simply taking them off. of course most people will just say they are resting their eyes when they take off their glasses, but I am sure more than one actually enjoys seeing things out of focus and blurry? You may have put it best when you said that "you love wearing glasses, but you also love needing them." Your probably by far not the only one that even likes taking your glasses off to clean them even if they don't need cleaning. Rubbing the lenses with a cloth between your fingers and feeling the thickness of your lenses and remembering how your first lenses were almost paper thin. I'm sure that is a turn on for you as well. You have to wonder if some of your work colleagues don't feel much the same way but don't want to tell anyone how they feel. You have to know that your friend Vicky without any doubt has to feel the way as you do. If anything she is more obsessed than you are about her glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2016, 10:46</p><p>Soundmanpt - I can see without glasses. Everything is slightly out of focus so I could probably tell what sort of bird it was if it was on the grass not too far away. You're right about Gemma, birds in the garden are just blobs of different colour without her glasses on.  </p><p>Yes I love wearing glasses but I also love needing them. I love how what I'm looking at sort of jumps when I take my glasses off and when I put them on again and how things go from slightly fuzzy or very fuzzy, depending how close the object is, to clear. I like feeling the thickness of my lenses when I clean them (not very thick I know but thicker than my first glasses.) I also like holding my glasses at arms length and seeing how my lenses magnify things. All these things do get me turned on a bit and I'm sure several other Eyescene users also get turned on by their own glasses too. I think it increases my enjoyment of sex because often I'm already buzzing with sexual energy by the time I'm in bed with Gemma if I've been thinking about glasses and then seeing her just drives me wild. My sex life would be more than satisfactory if I wasn't turned on by glasses. </p><p>Sorry if anyone finds that inappropriate but to be fair I wasn't graphic and we're all adults.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2016, 08:21</p><p>Caroline </p><p>Oh okay I didn't realize when you were talking about 20 units you were adding them together. So she is thinking your likely to soon be needing 10 units per eye for your prisms. Very interesting what happened to you at the party. If your eyes started seeing double even with your glasses on the drinks no doubt relaxed you as well as your eyes which means that even with your glasses your now still needing do a little extra work in fusing your eyes so you don't see double. So your probably going to start to notice that anytime you allow your eyes to relax your going to see double. This isn't what you want o hear but your probably going to be needing to see Great much sooner than a year. I can tell you that this is really very normal and that was why I asked you when you were to return to get your eyes examined again. You were interested in chatting with others that have prisms in here. I remembered a short while ago a young lady in here that like you was just getting started with having prisms added to her glasses. Her prescription is only slightly stronger than yours but she does have an add (bifocals) which you don't have in your glasses. unlike you she preferred to wear contacts because she is quite athletic and enjoys playing many sports. So the she wasn't happy finding out that she wouldn't be able to wear contacts anymore and have to deal with glasses for sports. Anyway I went back and found her comments and her experiences are much the same as your just starting to go through. Her name is Kris and if you go back in the "Vision" thread you will find where she first came in on March 14 2015  14:26 her glasses prescription at that time was R +1.75 -.50 / L +1.00  with an add of +2.25. She was first told she might need prisms because she was getting eye fatigue and headaches. reading on she was first prescribed with 2 BO each eye. Like you at first she was still able to wear her contacts but her glasses with the prisms soon became more comfortable for her eyes. Be sure to read her comment on October 3 2015  12:21 she has some things that should interest you in there. There are many more comments from her which you can follow from then on. One thing she says is that even with her glasses on she started to notice that anytime she relaxed her eyes she would see double. Pretty much the same thing that happened to you at the party. I'm sure this all must be a little scary for you. Over the past 24 years you have clearly enjoyed wearing your glasses much more than you ever really needed to wear glasses. You still knew that if you were to ever lose or break your glasses you could easily still see well enough to drive home without glasses. Double vision is going to prevent you from ever being able to drive without your glasses again. I would suggest hat for the time being you pay close attention to see if you find it increasingly difficult to hold fusion before you call about your eyes. You might want to check where you bought your glasses from because many if not most optical shops will remake your lenses if there is any change in your prescription within a certain time frame. For many that is 90 days. </p><p>Was your daughter surprised when she had to pick you up from the party because you couldn't see to drive even though you had your glasses on? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2016, 00:06</p><p>Caroline </p><p>  Interesting that you were seeing double after a few drinks. </p><p>  Did any of your friends say that you looked cross-eyed?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Caroline</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2016, 22:58</p><p>No you did not say 20 units, that is what she measured with the frame,looking an eye at a time, and telling her where the arrow is, it was on 10 with each eye. SHe said that they like to correct about half , or the minimum acceptable, hence starting me on 8 (4@4) for the first year, and retest. she said I could call anytime, I have paid them thousands over my spectacular 24 years!   see how it goes. </p><p>I went to a party, and had about 5 drinks last Saturday, a lot for me, but it was a special girls night out, and at midnight, I was seeing double!

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2016, 18:27</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I figured that you probably didn't meet up or you would have provided an update about Vicky and her new glasses. I'm pretty sure when you ladies all get together again Vicky will be more than happy to tell more about how her eyes are reacting to her glasses and if she noticed much of a difference now that she has her own glasses. </p><p>Actually I get it that Gemma and you enjoy laying out in the sun with your glasses off listening to the birds sing. Without glasses yoiur sure to notice the singing of the birds more sense your sense of vision is somewhat limited. More so for Gemma since i'm sure she can only see a few feet clearly without her glasses. With some squinting and straining you can probably still make out slightly blurry image of a bird. Don't you enjoy seeing things slightly out of focus and blurry when you take off your glasses. Yes of course you love wearing your glasses and seeing everything nice and clear but the whole idea of wearing glasses is how different everything looks without your glasses. I'm sure you almost enjoy that as much as you enjoy wearing your glasses. Anyone that has perfect eyesight only gets to see things one way. You get to see things in different ways by just removing your glasses. If you were to sit and have a nice long chat with Vicky I bet she would tell you that she not only loves wearing her glasses but she too probably enjoys the fact that now without her glasses she doesn't see things clearly like she did when she still had her perfect vision. Yesterday I was researching something and had to back in some of the threads looking for it and never did find what I was looking for. But I came across some of the early posts from you when Vicky had just started wearing Danielle's glasses the first time and she had to constantly take them off because she couldn't see anything at a distance with them and they even gave her headaches from trying to wear them. It was back in 2014. Finally Danielle sat down with her and together they ordered her some glasses on line with +.50 lenses and they were better but still not perfect at first but she was able to see distance somewhat better with them and slowly her eyes adjusted to them. Seemed strange re reading those comments form you about her struggles trying to wear glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2016, 14:55</p><p>Hi Soundmanpt  </p><p>No, didn't meet up with Danielle and Vicky this weekend apart from a quick "Hi" to them as we passed the coffee shop but we didn't have time to stop, sadly. Big family get together on Saturday evening so we had to rush to do the shopping we wanted to do during Saturday daytime. </p><p>Since being with Gemma one of our favourite ways to relax on warm spring and summer days is to lie in our little garden without glasses or prescription sunglasses on and just listen to the birds singing. Simply wonderful. Gemma says taking her glasses off helps her to concentrate on the birdsong because everything is in various states of being out of focus if she opens her eyes. My distance vision is much better than Gemma's but it is nice to have nothing on my face sometimes even though I like the feeling of glasses on my face. If we are feeling brave and it's warm enough it won't just be our glasses that come off!&#128521; Being in England that doesn't happen very often!&#128512; Today was a day for summer clothes and no glasses. </p><p>Does anyone else like to relax in their garden without glasses? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maxim</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2016, 14:02</p><p> </p><p>I can't find this nice story from a sunday on the flea market somewhere in the U.S. from two or three weeks ago. There was a 'GWG spotter' (like train spotter, plane spotter etc.) telling us his sightings of that day. </p><p> </p><p>I had a comparable experience today (Sunday late afternoon - early evening in our little town). </p><p> </p><p>All this took place at the outside chair of an Italian 'Gelateria' (Ice Café) on the market place of our town. I was more concentrated on my family, but I couldn't help seeing two interesting things: </p><p> </p><p>1. A young couple - I presume, just new acquaintances, these are rituals of the first two weeks: she had really nice Wayfarers with an estimated -4.00 on both eyes. I am sure, he asked her, and she asked herself ... how well she could see:  glasess up (5 seconds), glasses down again (5 sec.), glasses up ... . ... how well she could see with and without her glasses. He seemed not to wear glasses (zero sunglasses obviously) and seemed curious about these questions (seemed not be be an OO), and this was a nice conversation topic for them. (I am sure, he will soon go for an eye exam for reasons of 'solidarity'). They sat relatively far away, and I could not hear any word of their conversation, but I could READ the conversation like a 'pantomime play', when you know what I mean. </p><p> </p><p>2. Nearly immediate neighbours was a very young couple as well. I knew the girl from seeing her, in ahop, in school, or from certain public events. She was at an estimated 20-25 yrs of age, more 20 (between my youngest daughter 17 and one of my daughters in law 27). I don't want to be unpolite or uncorrect. But what surprised me: in her very elegant designer frame (could be at 100, or at 300 Euros) I could - without any doubt -  identify the typical deflection structures of varifocal lenses, very thin high index AR etc., with obviously less than -1.00 or even zero in the distance section, and a very low plus prescription in the continous zone and then reading section.  </p><p>I was really surprised, I have heard and read, that US, Japan and Korean optometrists are prescribing reading sections to very young people or even kids, but I have never heard of that in Europe! It helps - most the optometrist going away with an estimated 600-900 Euros instead of 100-250 only. But I can imagine, that bi- or varifocals are great f. smartphone </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Traveler</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2016, 12:49</p><p>Another great sighting tonight. </p><p>I was about half way thru my starter when the waiter came over and asked if I would mind sharing my table as they had a big party booking. He was indicating a twenty something lady who had her face turned away so I said Sure. </p><p>Je motioned her over and she was beautiful with long dark hair and a significant plus prescription in a slightly oversized dark plastic frame. She was European with not much English unfortunately but she really brightened up my meal with views of her beautiful dark eyes magnified behind the glints and gleams of her stong glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Traveler</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2016, 12:41</p><p>Sunday breakfast at hotels is a great place to see lots of gwg. Today was particularly special as I could count 11 at one stage. All minus, no readers at all. </p><p>Some significant prescriptions. One clise to double figures, drill mount with half inch polished edges and loads of power rings highlighting tiny eyes at the table 6 feet away. A Japanese family with mother and beautiful 16 yr old daughter wearing similar black eliptical frames with at least -8.Two upper teen sisters with the standard oversized lenses with a lot of power rings and cut in.  </p><p>A great mornk g. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2016, 10:18</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Since you didn't post any comment I must assume that you and Gemma didn't meet up with Danielle and Vicky over the weekend. Just curious about any updates now that Vicky has her own glasses to wear. The last update was when all 4 of you met up and Vicky had gotten her glasses earlier that same day. She said that she could see really clearly with her new glasses. But now that she has been wearing her glasses for over a week and her eyes should be adjusted to them by now i wonder if she notices any differences between Danielle's glasses which had been wearing for close a year and her own glasses which has some slight differences in the prescriptions. Even though her prescription is slightly weaker than Danielle's glasses the fact that her glasses has astigmatism correction should actually make her eyesight slightly clearer wearing her own glasses. I wonder if things look slightly more blurry to her now when she takes her glasses off than before? Having astigmatism correction in her glasses now probably means she can't focus as well without her glasses. That is likely a bigger difference for her than not having the extra +.25 in her glasses like she had with Danielle's glasses. Simply put her eyes didn't need the extra +.25 SPH but they do need the -.25 of CYL she now has. Since her glasses are considerably weaker than your glasses she is more likely to notice the astigmatism than you did. I'm sure Vicky is still very excited because she is finally wearing her own glasses prescribed for her eyes and her eyes only. Like you said this has to the justification she wanted.  </p><p>Have a great rest of the weekend! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2016, 14:58</p><p>Likeliness: You need to tell her about your affair with JUNE....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2016, 08:36</p><p>caroline </p><p>Prisms is referred to as units not diopters. As you may have noticed unlike your SPH and CYL which always has a + or - in front of the numbers prisms is just a number. That is because prisms is just the angle of your lenses in the way your eyes are seeing through your lenses. If you look closely at your previous glasses and compare the lenses you should notice that the glasses with the prisms lenses are slightly different than your previous glasses lenses. When you were talking with Greta about your eyes and the prisms did she say that she plans on increasing the prisms to around 10 in each lens? Personally if you weren't told to come back for 12 months she must not expect you to have any problem with your eyes with just the 4 base in. You will be the one that will determine if you need to go back sooner. If after a few months you start to find that even with your glasses on your having to force your eyes to not see double. If that happens then you will need to go and get more prisms added to your glasses. Considering that you have already had your glasses for over a month and with a little effort your still able to wear your previous glasses without a problem. Even better since you did get a small increase in your SPH from +1.00 to +1.25. Yes that isn't much of a change but it is considering your prescription is really quite weak to begin with. For someone that is +3.50 and they go up to +3.75 for them that is hardly noticeable. So fro them it is like a 3% increase, for you it's more like a 30% increase. It's nice that you can still see so well with your first +.50 glasses, but if you were to try reading a book for several hours wearing them I have a feeling your eyes would soon give out on you. I know this because I wear readers myself and my readers are considerably stronger than your glasses are and I can still read small print without my glasses, that is as long as i'm in good light and i'm not going to be reading for a long time. and my eyes are much older than your eyes are since next month I will be 68.  </p><p>It would be a good idea to get a backup pair because at some point the double vision isn't going to go away anymore and all your previous glasses will just be for looks on shelf. But since there could be a change needed in your glasses after only a few months or you may be fine for a full year I would suggest go on line to get a backup pair. Zenni optical makes glasses with prisms up to 5 units. So perfect for you. I think they only add $9.00 for the prisms which i'm sure is much cheaper than your local optical shop. So you should be able to get a pair of really nice glasses for less than $30.00. I wouldn't change anything from your actual prescription. I'm not sure where you saw me say anything about getting 20 units of prisms? I know it wasn't me. Until now I didn't even know how much prism you were given. I had only said that it is common that they start you out with less </p></body></html>
