<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2017, 04:50</p><p>This post could fit into several threads (news personalities, Psychology of Glasses, or here). </p><p>Last week, ABC's Good Morning American had a brief report on an article in Reader's Digest suggesting a relationship between personality and frame choice. This is not real news to folks frequenting this site. </p><p>The information was simple: colorful, quirky frame choice showed a creative, independent personality; dark, conventional frames a more business-like personality; and so forth. </p><p>One interesting sidelight was the way the four hosts showed/shared their spex "illustrating" (or perhaps testing) the article's premise. </p><p>George Stephanopolos wore his businesslike glasses the whole time. On the other end of the spectrum, Robin Roberts, who has appeared with her head shaved bald during and after her cancer treatment, put on her glasses, always there on the desk beside her, only very very briefly, quickly snatching them off almost before the camera "caught" her wearing them. Lara Spencer put hers on a bit, but she too took them off as soon as the story was concluded. </p><p>I found it an interesting snapshot of the way, not only choice of frames, but also approaches to wearing the chosen spex also reveals something of a person's personality.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>PF</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2016, 22:50</p><p>Wow... the things you find at random... </p><p> </p><p>My name is Preston Fassel and I wrote the story for 20/20 that was mentioned a few posts ago. It's a sort of spinoff of a series of short stories I wrote for my college's literary magazine. I had the privilege of getting to write 20/20's fortieth anniversary story, and my editor was kind enough to suggest putting my literary talent to use for a first-of-its'-kind feature in the magazine. I was and remain forever grateful for his suggestion and support. There's more than a bit of autobiography to that story (as there always tends to be with fiction), and looking back on it now only two years later its' amazing how much of my own life is in it-- and how, in so many strange ways, that particular glimpse is so unrecognizable from my life now.  </p><p> </p><p>If anyone is still interested in reading it, it is indeed in the 20/20 archives online: https://www.2020mag.com/features/50802/ </p><p> </p><p>I've always loved glasses-- not just for helping people to see, but the other things they do for them: Allowing an individual to change his or her appearance and identity, to give the wearer a new sense of confidence. That's something it was important for me to infuse in the story. I hope it came across. </p><p> </p><p>I'm very glad you enjoyed it. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lv2c4i</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2016, 03:46</p><p>Some time ago there was an offer of "bifocal-on-top" lenses and glasses designed for people who work, for instance, in retail stores and do stocking of shelves. Because of this activity, they do not look down to read, but rather need to look either straight ahead or above to read both product labels and markings on shelves.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2016, 16:08</p><p>I, glasses, </p><p> </p><p>Over the past decades I had a few sightings of men and women wearing the lens type you describe. The glasses were all rimless and the interesting thing is that there were two lens types. The simplest type (chosen only by men) was a matter of cutting the lens in a straight horizontal line, giving the owner the effect of executive bifocals. I still see one of the men occasionally and I will ask him how he got his optician to make lenses like his. But I also saw a woman wearing the second lens type in which a half circle was removed, leaving two sharp downward "teeth" of the lens intact. She was an interesting (slightly eccentric) looking lady in her sixties. Good luck with your quest. No doubt, a good independent optician can do the job for you if you are prepared to pay him for the additional job.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>I, Glasses</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2016, 13:22</p><p>Quite some time ago, a magazine article about glasses showed a photo of a frame that was configured exactly the opposite of 'half-glasses' readers. The lenses were at the top of the frame; nothing was at the bottom, no lenses, no frame. They were designed for nearsighted people to use instead of bifocal glasses. Corrected distance vision through the lenses above, no correction at all, not even plano glass at the bottom. I am trying to find a frame like that. Does anybody know where I might look? Have any of you ever seen such a frame?  Thanks. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2015, 09:57</p><p>Have been meaning to post this for awhile, but....The Oct issue of 20/20 mag was devoted to it's 40th anniversary, and there was for the first time a fiction piece "a short story based in part on literary impressions of advertising and editorial from the very first issue", it's written by a pro named Preston Fassel and is great.  The theme is a 17 year old boy and a rebellious 18 year old girl who plan to run away from their small town Oklahoma home and go to NYC.  They're both glasses wearers and she wants a new pair.  He's an OO, she's myope, and go to a 1 hour optical. </p><p>She wants flamboyant cat eyes, he's more conservative. </p><p> </p><p>Here are a few phrases from the article: "she puts on the first frame, sharp-edged, corners like sickles, the ebony plastic a striking contrast toe the strawberry blonde of her voluminous mane".  And, "the next pair, sleeker dark at the top and fading into translucent white, the edges softer, more modish, a severe look with her skin tone but a comfortable fit on the bridge of her aquiline nose".  And, "eyes shining bright with life through the lenses of her thick Cat Eye glasses". </p><p> </p><p>Could have been written by a member of this community.

<p><b>presby L</b>&nbsp;17 May 2010, 18:51</p><p>I, Glasses.  Try eyebobs.com.  They have a great array of frames for every style and need.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>I, Glasses</b>&nbsp;17 May 2010, 08:56</p><p>I had meant for this post to go to 'Frames,' but I accidentally posted it on 'Sunglasses.' My apologies for the double posting. </p><p> </p><p>In the Age of Presbyopia, I use readers with half-glasses frames for close work. I prefer for the lenses to be slightly below the bridge of the frame instead of level with the bridge. However, because I've gotten used to contacts and rimless mountings for glasses, I do not like the frame around the top of the readers' lenses; I prefer that the top of the lenses have no rim. Also, I would like to find a traditional-looking half-glasses frame that is thinner and less noticeable than my current horn-rimmed ones. I have pored over 'Focusers' and other optical Web sites but haven't found what I'm looking for. Do any of you have any suggestions? Thanks. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

But my last experience of Dollond &amp; Aitchison was that there wasn't a frame in the shop I'd be seen dead in, and the prices were atrocious! Do you have a digital camera? If so, take it and a friend along with you to help you choose.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ivan</b>&nbsp;07 Oct 2007, 12:05</p><p>Now I'm miss keying! I meant "cant see" and not "can" re the camera/screen thingy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ivan</b>&nbsp;07 Oct 2007, 12:02</p><p>thanks for that Julian- I just used that link as an example for the style.I'll prob use Dolland &amp; Aitchinson as they have that handy camera/screen system where you can see how they look when you have your glasses back on-otherwise I have to rely on the judgement of the dispenser (not always a good thing as they can sometimes get carried away with off beat styles) and of course cus i simply can see anything without my glasses on!Oh the fun oh yes.At least I have a week or so to look at other guys out and about and see they appear and  what looks best. </p><p></p><hr>

I think they're a reasonable 'next step' after classic semi-rimless. Mine cost a lot more than Â£55, but then again  they were progressives - no problem with getting them in that lens shape - and photochromic. Go for it!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ivan</b>&nbsp;07 Oct 2007, 08:16</p><p>Hi every one. I'm currently trying to figure out whats what with current frame trends as I have to take an eye test in a couple of weeks and no doubt will need to get some new frames as well as lenses.My current prescription is a relatively high -6.25/-7.00 with some Gant semi-rimless frames.I'm not keen on the full-on thick dark emo type frames but nor do I want really another pair of classic semi's. I have seen some guys wearing  frames with this sort of style  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171209002529/http://www.glasses2you.co.uk/acatalog/PRESCRIPTION_READING_GLASSES_G2U1253.html#a168" target="_blank">http://www.glasses2you.co.uk/acatalog/PRESCRIPTION_READING_GLASSES_G2U1253.html#a168</a>  which seem to be getting quite popular.So then,being a 44 year old tall dark guy in reasonable shape with nice brown eyes (i'm told)should I stick with the tried and tested semi-rimless look or are they now "out" so to speak.Ivan,uk.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2007, 13:39</p><p>Julian - I work with Europeans and I find my Nordic and Dutch colleagues have particularly interesting choices in frames.  I presume they're not buying them in the UK!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2007, 22:43</p><p>Yes, I used to see a guy at dances wearing glasses like that with quite a strong minus Rx. Dark red plastic, then later on dark blue. Rather effective. Now when I see him he isn't wearing glasses at all ::( Contacts? Lasik? I don't know him and have never spoken to him, you understand, we just go to a lot of the same (Scottish dancing) events. I'd like to know where people find interesting specs like that; when I go shopping the range is much more boring. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>cut-in UK </b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2007, 15:34</p><p>Yes, they are hingeless and rimless and come in a variety of colours. Very lightweight and currently very fashionable. </p><p> </p><p>I've seen them on many optical sites. You just need to search under 'prescription glasses' and the choice is almost endless.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2007, 14:43</p><p>Has anyone seen rimless frames that are plastic or something similar? I saw these frames years ago that were for rimless glasses. They were plastic/acetate or something and came in many colors. Can someone help. I don't know of any brands. </p><p> </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;27 Oct 2006, 19:36</p><p>I am wondering if most people today wear or prefer others to wear eyeglass frames that are unisex in style "gender nuteral" or glasses that are "gender specific" especially made for men or women. Intrestingly, eyeglasses frames were not made gender specific until about the late 1940's. Before this time they were viewed strictly as an optical aid much like a hearing aid or crutches. In the prosporus 1950's was when eyeglasses became a fashion statement. During the late 60's early' 70's there was a return for a while to unisex styles with the metal framed "granny glasses" being in vogue.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Devin</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2006, 19:26</p><p>Cactus, </p><p>     I think I got my PD pretty accurate - I measured two or three times to check my accuracy and came right around 59 each time - so it should be good. </p><p> </p><p>     And I'm in VA.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2006, 05:12</p><p>Devin, </p><p>PD is not as critical with low Rx such as yous ss it is with higher or more complex Rx.  No matter what your Rx, PD acuracy is good. </p><p>BTW, where do you live? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Devin</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2006, 00:09</p><p>Thanks Cactus.  I remembered the one lady when I bought my current frames last year measuring me and saying I was symmetrical from my nose to each eye.  The bridge on my glasses is a 19 and each pupil is about 20 mm in from the side of my nose, so I came to a 59..... </p><p> </p><p>I did double-check that by the way, lol.... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2006, 19:09</p><p>Devin, </p><p>Center of the pupil to center of the pupil.  If you are doing it by looking in a mirror, it is better to measure from the center of the nose to the center of each pupil individually and add the two together. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Devin</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2006, 15:57</p><p>Oh, by the way, I'm shopping for a spare pair of glasses and forgot to ask this: </p><p> </p><p>For anyone who knows, when you measure pupillary distance, do you measure from edge to edge or from the middle of each pupil?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Devin</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2006, 12:30</p><p>Thanks Curt.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curt</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2006, 11:24</p><p>Devin:  In your example: </p><p> </p><p>52=width of the lens at its widest point (usually corner to corner) </p><p> </p><p>19=width of the bridge(aka nosepiece; the part between the lenses) </p><p> </p><p>140=the length of the stems (arms) from the frames to the end of the earpiece </p><p> </p><p>I believe all measurements are in millimeters. </p><p> </p><p>Hope this helps! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Devin</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2006, 11:20</p><p>I'm just curious, for any of you guys who know, what each measurement entails exactly. </p><p> </p><p>For instance, on the inside of my glasses it says 52-19 140. </p><p> </p><p>I know those are in millimeters, but what is the 52 from?

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2006, 12:06</p><p>DO NOT USE NAIL POLISH OR ANY OTHER CHEMICAL ON YOUR LENSES! You will destroy your lenses and then you will have to buy new ones $$$. Try taking them back to where you got them and ask for a free exchange of the lenses. Other than that, try to get used to them. There are benefits to anti reflective lenses. They will give you better eyesight at night.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2006, 14:25</p><p>New Specs: What to do about your glasses for sports really depends on how well you see without them. Did you have problems seeing to play before you got glasses? Certainly it would be unfortunate to get them broken, so if you do need them for sports, goggles might be a good idea. Also, do you know if your lenses are shatter-resistant (not that that's a guarantee they won't break, but it makes it less likely). Glad to hear your new look is getting rave reviews. You'll get used to the feeling of them on your face-I've gotten to where my face feels strange without them!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>New Specs</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2006, 09:21</p><p>Thanks to everybody who responded. I really appreciate all of your kind words and encouragement. I now officially wear glasses. I dont know if I was more nervous on the way to pick them up yesterday or when I first walked into school today. I can see much better, I just feels weird having this big piece of plastic hanging on my face all day long! The glasses are bigger on my face than what I thought they would be so I definitely have the I wear glasses&#65533; look with the dark plastic glasses as opposed to the more tame metal frames that I almost picket out. I have very short dark hair, so the glasses take on a more prominent part of my appearance, as you can see the frames (the stick&#65533; part whatever it is??) on top of my ears&#65533;. Today at school was really not that bad. I received many compliments from my teachers and classmates and felt flattered by it all. My boyfriend is cool with my specs, so that always helps. Im still getting used to them and still feel somewhat self-conscience about wearing glasses. Its just so weird to have the appearance of my face altered so much. </p><p> </p><p>I play softball in the spring and volleyball in the fall, does anybody have advice as far as playing sports with glasses? With being nearsighted, I dont think I can get by without my glasses playing sports. Are goggles worth getting?  </p><p> </p><p>Just wanted to say again I appreciate all of the encouraging words that everybody has posted. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2006, 16:41</p><p>New Specs:Hi! I remember when I first got glasses. I was 14. I think my reaction after the eye exam was shock because I found out I was legally blind (20/200) correctable, but still a shock. I had known I was nearsighted actualy since I was 7, but I put off getting glasses for some reason. But I DID NOT know I was THAT nearsighted! I still remember exactly what my eye doc said to my Mom "She's significantly nearsighted". I had mixed feelings about glasses-part of me has always felt a strange attraction toward them, but I also felt a bit embarresed about it. And I'd heard of people who got them and suddenly THEY COULD SEE!!!! and it was wonderful and I wondered if it would be that way for me. On the way to the opticians I asked Mom to let me see the rx and more shock-it was OD-4.50 OS-4.00! I knew even then (I started this interest early) that was strong for a first rx. I ended up choosing round, gold frames a la John Lennon (actualy I was in such a state of (I know I keep using this word, but I can't help it) shock that I more-or-less let the optician pick for me. It did not help that they kept making a big deal about how strong the rx was and how thick the specs were going to be. Then they had them ready (they'd had to do one lens over because they said they had trouble with lenses that thick) and she put them on me and WOW!!!! All I can say is Shocked again!!!! I had no idea how much I'd been missing! I could actualy see a person's facial features from 5 FEET AWAY that in itself was amazing but to be able to see them from clear (CLEAR!) across the room, that was simply mind-blowing! But anyway, enough of my not-so-misty memoirs. I'd just like to add,New Specs, it was smart of you to go ahead and get them and not put it off like I did. I nearly failed 5th grade math because of my inability to see the board (gives a whole new meaning to "fuzzy math"). Was it a shock to you to discover you needed glasses, or did you already know?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>New Specs</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2006, 09:31</p><p>Hello:  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>My name is Jessica. I am 12 years old and had my eyes checked yesterday and found out for the first time that I will have to wear glasses (and full time - - I am nearsighted) The frames will be ready next week. While I'm glad I will be able to see better, I am very nervous about having to wear glasses, as I have never worn them before and to say the least I'm sure it is going to be very ackward, escpecailly at school. I hate to say it, but I started balling when I found out that I needed glasses. I took a long time to pick out the frames as I debated between a more tame metal frame and a more bold plastic frames. I got the dark squarish plastic frames (very similar to Ashliegh Banfield's) so I am "going all out" with these frames.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I'm better know as I am resigned to the fact that I will have to wear them full time, but looking for any advice in adapting to being bespecled and 4 eyes.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Any ideas/insight would be greatly appreciated.

When I came out of the exam my husband asked me if I needed reading glasses, and I replied yes.  He pointed out a few pairs of half frames and I told him that they would not be satisfactory for me since the Dr. during the exam also told me that I was slightly nearsighted in both eyes.  I never realized that I was nearsignted until I looked thru the lenses in the machine during the exam and saw how much clearer my vision was thru the lenses.

<p><b>roy</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2005, 06:29</p><p>Can anyone help? Due to myopia plus quite a high base out prism my glasses are quite thick on the outer edges (10-11mm). The thickness is not a problem to me and is also partly due to the fact that I prefer not to have high index lenses and like fairly large aviator frames. My current frames (which I like) are themselves fairly thick (around 4-5 mm) round the lenses and this means they look better, with the thick lenses, than very thin frames would, and also grip the lenses better. The problem is that I cannot find any new thicker metal aviator style frames for use with thicker lenses. I would be happy to purchase online. All the aviator style frames seem to be ultra thin and lightweight. I don't like plastic frames. Anyone know where I can find thicker metal frames?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daffy</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2005, 18:13</p><p>Visitboy...If you're already wearing glasses full-time, switching to different styles doesn't really affect anyone. You will get comments for getting 'new' frames and that's about it. As for the wearer, it takes a little time to get used to 'seeing' the frame when they are on. What i mean is, when you have metal frames, the frame becomes 'invisible', you don't see it. When you switch to plastics, then the frame makes you more aware that you wear glasses. But you get over it soon and get used to it. </p><p> </p><p>The only other thing that changes, is that the metal frames have the independant nose pads, the plasic frame (usually, but not always) has a nose pad that is part of the frame. If the frame sits well, it 'hugs' your nose (like on the sides and across) - hope it's understandable. Some people don't like the feeling of nosepads and prefer the plastic frame for that reason. It's all personal and you never know unless you try. I reckon - go for it!</p><p></p><hr>

You could say I'm "nerdy" because I graduated from college Magna Cum Laude and I'm a computer programmer; but I've always enjoyed wearing bold frames -- they're more colorful and noticeable, they fit me better, and they do attract men.  It worked, as I have a great husband (who also wears glasses).  Women also like my frames, probably because (A) they're bored with all that's out there now, and (2) they figure "big, bold, and beautiful" may help them look more attractive.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Vidge</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2003, 14:51</p><p>True enough, Lore. Asains do favor semi and full rimless. It may be due to their smaller nose and high cheek bone facial structure. Africans generally wear heavy and highly ornate style frames. Though I have seen many young Black woman wearing small, mostly black plastic frames in various shapes: rect.; cateye; oval; ect. many with the lenses having a very light brown tint, which looks very good on them.                                                   Teah, Most white women I see are in wire ovals or round or rectangle frames of gold; silver or matt black color. Occasionally they will have on semi rimless or few will venture into cateye, butterfly or rectangle plastic.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2003, 10:08</p><p>I'd actually disagree with Vidge's analysis quite a bit. </p><p> </p><p>First off, frame style seems to vary quite a bit culturally.  For example, almost all of the Asian (from Asia, not Asian-American) students at the university I attend wear wire, semi-rimless, or rimless glasses.  So, I'm not about to make any generalizations about that, since it might be a cultural thing, or have to do with the kinds of glasses that are available in certain countries. </p><p> </p><p>An interesting thing I've noticed, though, among American students, is that the kinds of women who seem to (at least superficially) want to conform to "conventional" standards of attractiveness (i.e., sorority girls and the like) will often wear plastic-framed glasses, whereas guys with similar standards (i.e., frat boys) tend to wear wire-framed glasses.  So, it seems to me that plastic frames are far more likely to be seen on women, since they are worn both by women who are interested in following trends as well as women who want an "edgy" or "alternative" look, while they are almost always only worn by guys who are going for an "alternative" look.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Teah</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2003, 08:45</p><p>i disagree. i think it really depends on the person. for example, my mom had rimless a while ago for exactly the purpose you state (actually she went back to wire frames because the screws in the side of the lens bothered her periferal vision) it's probably like that for most people. but have a friend who wears rimless not at all to hide the fact he wears glasses. ok, so the lenses are rather thick so that helps, but the temples are bright red, and the bridge is bright blue (metal, but not thin like wire) and i think they certainly make a statement...they're certainly exccentric frames.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2003, 15:17</p><p>I think people who wear semi rimless glasses like to pretend that they don't wear or need glasses and this is reflected in the fact that this style frame in minimal to the wearer and to those viewing the wearer.  Semi wearers usually have a more active life style. </p><p>Plastic wear is more formal and those who choose this style eyewear are less active and are more aware of their need for vision correction.  </p><p>Wire rim wearers are somewhat in the middle between these to types. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2003, 03:37</p><p>I remember my first frames. They were silver, holding large lenses, with two bars forming the bridge. I never really liked two bars for the bridge - but I never found anything in silver without them - until I was onto my fourth pair. Those ones were more like brushed steel than silver, and they held slightly smaller lenses, but only had one bar for the bridge. My current pair are gold (for a change) Flexon, nice 'n' bendy, still with large lenses, and a single bar for the bridge. I only really like wearing metal frames, and although I thought silver was the best colour, I recently switched to gold. I suppose I'm fairly conservative in my choice, and tend to stick with what I like, rather than experiment too much.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nikki</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2003, 01:10</p><p>I too am the owner of some boring and uninteresting type frames, but that comment got  me thinking as to what would be the most popular frame for first time wearers, I am guessing for the most part it would be just this sort of frame, I understand styles come and go but I am meaning as in metal/plastic/rimless, and also meaning frames you picked youself and not handpicked by a parent. Do you all remember your first frames and how far you have come with your choices, or do you think they have pretty much stayed the same?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NTA</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2003, 00:43</p><p>I am a female and I am one of those people who wear the "boring and uninteresting wire frame glasses of a semi oval nondescript type" as someone here put it. I don't like to make a statement with my glasses, I guess. I am not a really shy person, but I think I get shy when I wear glasses. I usually wear contacts, so I get nervous if I see people who have never seen me in glasses before. </p><p> </p><p>I used to have those plastic ones too, but I think I looked kinda geeky. I talked to Alan in some other thread about this before. I have some pictures lying around somewhere of me in them, but I have been too lazy to scan and upload them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2003, 16:49</p><p>Interesting topic Vidge. </p><p> </p><p>I can understand somebody going for bold frames - say plastic. I can understand people going for rimless and semi rimless to be more unnoticable. </p><p> </p><p>I can't understand anybody chosing boring and uninteresting wire frame glasses of a semi oval nondescript type. </p><p> </p><p>It must have been great in the 50's and 60's to see girls in the statement making bold uplifting catseye glasses. They are the best. I hope they will come back into fashion sooner rather than later. </p><p> </p><p>Similarly for men, I would love to see the Buddy Holly style glasses come back into fashion. They are sooo  stylish and make a great statement. Is there anything we could do to perpetuate this trend? </p><p> </p><p>What do other people think? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Vidge</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2003, 16:36</p><p>I am always curious as to why a person chooses a certain eyeglass frame style. No one can help what Rx he or she must wear but in frame selection the choises are many if not vast. One's bank account plays a role and certain prescriptions are not available in all frame types.  It seems ethnicity plays a minor role. Age a greater role. Naturally, women have a much wider latitude in there choise of selection, as it should be. Sence I am a committed GWG watcher my main interest is in the fairer sex. </p><p>So why then will one lady choose to wear rimless or semi-rimless another plastic cateyes and a third go with plain Jane unisex wire rim ovals? The choise of wearing of contact lenses takes on an even greater contemplation. Feedback, anyone! </p><p></p><hr>
