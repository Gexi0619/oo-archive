<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;30 Apr 2014, 05:06</p><p>@HighMyopic - dream on my friend, $10-20 you must be having a laugh! I've listed a few pairs from my collection, three of which are between -21 and -23 - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420014235/http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/phwoaryoureyes/m.html" target="_blank">http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/phwoaryoureyes/m.html</a> - I would expect them to go for at $100 a pair given previous sales</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;29 Apr 2014, 20:43</p><p>Well, I suggest that you don't hold your breath waiting for someone to sell you a pair at that price High Myopic. Even if you were to buy new from SGS's website I think the lowest price would be around $40.00 USD</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>HighMyopic</b>&nbsp;29 Apr 2014, 11:59</p><p>@gwg I want to spend about 10 to 20 dollars per pair.   I have a lot of other things right now that I want to spend my money on.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;29 Apr 2014, 04:49</p><p>@HighMyopic - How much do you want to spend per pair?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>HighMyopic</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2014, 17:30</p><p>Does anyone have any extra pairs of very strong glasses that they can mail to me so I can add them to my eyeglasses collection?  I also love to wear thick and very strong eyeglasses.  </p><p> </p><p>I am looking for eyeglasses with very thick lenses and very high rx.  Like from -15 to -40 diopters. </p><p></p><hr>

Just go to your favorite search engine and put in Shuron Nulady Deluxe. I did a quick check, and www.simplyeyeglasses.com sells this frame in a varity of sizes and colors for $86.40. </p><p> </p><p>Also, you might want to check www.vintageeyeglassesonline.com</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>aviator -oo-</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2012, 07:05</p><p>Here are some nice frames (probably expensive, too: www.zioeyewear.com </p><p> </p><p>They are handmade in Italy - although I'm not sure what 'hand made' really means in the context of glasses manutacturing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2012, 10:14</p><p>In the not-to-distant past, on some of the more current threads (Choosing Frames, On-Line Retailers, etc.) there were some postings linking to websites that specialized in collectible stuff including clothes, shoes, and of course eyewear.  Decided to post here because the thread name accurately describes what I'm looking for. </p><p> </p><p>If anyone here can save me some time, do you know what those links are and if so, will you post them.  Not interested in e-bay or other auction-type sites, but actual businesses.  Am specifically looking for 50's cateyes with rhinestones or other temple and frame front decor. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2012, 23:59</p><p>Bubba, </p><p> </p><p>for new glasses: Urban Spectacles in Chicago (custom wooden eyewear). </p><p>My own collection hosts two pairs of wooden glasses. One pair is from the 1990's (called Gold and Wood), the other pair was made in 1966 and has no brand name. The Gold and Wood pair was used during my third photo shoot with a Mayhem model (Astrid 445) and the 1966 pair can be seen in many of my photo shoots (e.g. Lucy, Douce, Farishta and Astrid). </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bubba</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2012, 23:06</p><p>I collect unusual frames and am interested if anyone has tried wooden frames or knows a good stockist?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wes</b>&nbsp;13 Jun 2012, 13:11</p><p>Just wondering if there's any reason why pince-nez shouldn't get popular again?  I guess they could be a little uncomfortable but surely technology has moved on nowadays so this could be improved?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bubba</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2012, 13:06</p><p>Interesting site there. I'm trying to bring pince nez back into style</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2010, 08:59</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p>Splinters can usually be eliminated by running the lenses </p><p>through a turboencabulator. The hylog wheel must be kept in contact at all times when doing this.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2010, 02:45</p><p>Just collected my new glasses yesterday.  The frames are made of a revolutionary new material: heat tempered pie crust. My Rx remains at its usual -3.141593</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2010, 01:11</p><p>unknown </p><p>Your right that did work better than the sandpaper. Any idea how to stop the splinters?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2010, 15:28</p><p>Soundmanpt, wooden lenses can be made clear is seconds with ammomium biflouride.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>elizabeth</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2010, 14:12</p><p>There was a maker of wooden frames some time ago, dont know if they are still making them....Dakota Smith. </p><p> </p><p>and if you want real Gold and animal horn, try...Gold&amp;Horn;</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wei</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2010, 14:04</p><p>Frame very wooden. But lens not wood! Lens mysodisc! Very nice!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2010, 13:43</p><p>I got wooden glasses once, I could only see about 1/2" with them and what I saw looked a lot like plywood. By the way how do you clean wooden lenses??? The only thing I found that seemed to work was sandpaper. It did cut down on the splinters though. The frame color was nice - redwood with a clear coat, works like UV coat but better. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2010, 12:49</p><p>I always get great deals on my glasses -- $5 apiece or 3 for $25, provided the prescription is at least +/- 98.6 diopters.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;31 May 2010, 16:17</p><p>Through much scientific research I have been able to create </p><p>a frame from unobtainium that will hold lenses up to 2 inches thick and lenses less than zero inches thick. </p><p>The less than zero thick lenses need to be kept at a temperature slightly below absolute zero so the necessary cryogenics come in a lightweight backpack. </p><p>The whole system including backpack is priced at a dollar two fifty.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2009, 11:22</p><p>In my collection of 45 glasses that I initially had, I have about 25 pairs left, in 8 different styles...one style has no been cleared out.  I'm selling these at cost, as I was clearing them out of the optical shop I own here in Oklahoma.  I'd rather sell them at cost to you instead of throw them away.   Once I get all of these styles cleared out, I have some more clearance frames to list.  I'll try to make them up with -26 lenses, or something similar, since most of you like really strong glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I loaded up some pictures with myself modeling the glasses.  Gives you an idea of what the glasses look like on someone, an average Joe.  Also, the pics might be fun to look at.  </p><p> </p><p>Also, remember, since I own an optical shop, I can always do custom scripts for an additional fee, up to about a -19.   </p><p> </p><p>Anyways, here's what I have left:  </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420014235/http://shop.ebay.com/patrickhh523/m.html?_nkw=&amp;_armrs=1&amp;_from=&amp;_ipg=" target="_blank">http://shop.ebay.com/patrickhh523/m.html?_nkw=&amp;_armrs=1&amp;_from=&amp;_ipg=</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bck2DFtr</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2004, 12:51</p><p>I am trying to locate a pair of glasses from the 80s.  I am not sure what one would call these.  They are a pair of glasses that just wrap around from ear to ear with 1 eye piece.  I think Devo might have worn something like this.  Also, a pair can be seen in the movie "16 Candles" at the school dance.  A nerd is wearing a pair.  If anyone knows the name of these type of glasses and where I might be able to find a pair, pleae let me know.  Thanks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2003, 15:43</p><p>I discovered a nice 'trove' of vintage frames from the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s today. I purchased four frames for my collection. </p><p> </p><p>I thought the 80s stuff was quite good, really the best I've seen in any one place. They had some truly outrageous drop temple styles, including a few with rhinestone pavé. Very over-the-top stuff. Quite a few styles with highly baroque temple treatments also, including a wild two-tone split temple style I only dimly remembered. </p><p> </p><p>If you are interested, and in Portland, Oregon, then check out Hendrix, McGuire &amp; Di Gregorio at 925 SW Taylor.

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;16 Sep 2002, 08:15</p><p>GwGs, Julian: am enjoying this thread, even thought it's not exactly right on topic.  Maybe be stirring the pot, so to speak, some of the early posters will come back.  GwGs, I am close to Julian in age (62) although he and I are of course wired a little differently as I am a flaming heterosexual.  So what?  Anyway, I remember being attracted to glasses since I remember anything, at least since age 4 or 5.  And the next extention of that was being attracted to GWG's ever since first noticing girls, which was probably around 7 or so. Was a voracious (and early)reader, even clipped out and hid old House Of Vision ads from the city newspapers and mention of glasses from women's mags. Puberty of course kicked this whole attraction into overdrive, and as a result, it took a long time to come out of the closet. It galls me to think that I could've become an optician 40 years ago but wouldn't begin to mention it because people might discover my real reasons.  The only saving grace is that my chosen profession allowed me to be on the periphery as a cover, and then set up the eventual coming out. In short I had to get old before I got bold and just wish I'd done this sooner. No one thinks I'm weird at all, in fact, most are admiring and maybe somewhat jealous that I had a second fun career waiting in the wings for when I was able to shuck the first one. And Julian, speaking of old names, went back to some of the hard copies I printed out of "good stuff" back as far as 1998, let's see if any of these rise to the bait: Meganekko, Prevert, Jey Ping, Dale, Geoff, Aviator, Ms.IIII, Specsgirl, RaeMinus4, t4tubes, Wanda, Melyssa, etc. etc.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2002, 13:14</p><p>Ahem, GwGs, I'm 63 and not at all into girls with spex appeal. My motto is 'Spexy guys are sexy guys' and has been as long as I can remember. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2002, 13:10</p><p>Gosh, yes, OGL - 'Where are they now, the old familiar faces?' Stefan's still around, and Tom the Hungarian, and Stan. Filthy McNasty and Tek Pa put in the occasional appearance. But is the Brian who posts now the Brian who wrote about getting his first glasses five years ago. There's a Mark, but not the original Mark who ran the 'Guys in glasses' site. Not to mention all the less well-authenticated characters (shall we say) who used to come around. </p><p>Oh, nostalgia - but even that isn't what it used to be ::) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2002, 11:58</p><p>Wurm: you're absolutely right about liking the mix of folks we have here, it's wonderful for the old timers to rap with the new posters about all of the different topics.  If I had two wishes it would be for more of the olders posters to return (hello, are you still lurking out there?) and for us to attract new ones.  For better or for worse, even globally, there is a limited number of "us".</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2002, 10:48</p><p>Hi OGL, </p><p> </p><p>hehe I don't think I'll be catching up to your hoard anytime soon. I'm just hoping to build a representative 1940s - 1990s collection, and I'm well on my way to that goal. </p><p> </p><p>I don't have a scanner anymore but it would nice if someone could get that historical style info into digital format. Perhaps someone will start up a collectors-only site sometime for that type of thing (I kind of like the mix of folks here; even though collecting is one of my major glasses-related interests it's not the only one). </p><p> </p><p>I do remember 'reviewing' some frames from your collection. It seems like another life to me too 8-/ But it sure was fun at the time!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2002, 06:24</p><p>Wurm: whaddya' doin', trying to catch up with me?  I don't have time to count my antique/collectibles but came close to it last weekend.  One of our posters is interested in buying some of mine, so I took some pictures, got up to 50 some and gave up, and those were just my large frames and drop temples. Did I dream this, or have you seen a half dozen or so from my collection...I seem to remember sending them in a different lifetime.  Anyway, I also have some old trade journals with advertising photos, and one issue devoted entirely to the history of frame styling that is very heavy into the sixties through the eighties.  Don't want it torn apart, of course, is there any way it can be sent to one of the websites and posted without being damaged?  It's one of a kind.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2002, 19:34</p><p>Just received a shipment of 25 vintage frames from an eBay auction today. They are mostly from the 60's and 70's, with perhaps a couple straggling into the early 80's as well. Quite a mix, but mostly small and medium eyesizes. Quite a few from Austria and Germany as well as some from France and Italy. The Australian frames are very artsy: muscular shapes with cool metallic treatments like brushed steel and antiqued copper. "Raybert" brand. </p><p> </p><p>Wow, it sure is fun getting a whole box of frames!!! Certainly gives my collection more representation in the early- to mid-60s hipster category.</p><p></p><hr>

I am seriously into 1980s glasses(though not so much drop temples actually,just big boldly coloured plastic frames)I have tended to attribute my preference for large frames as  being generational......I was 25/26 in 1980 and extremely appreciative of beautiful women generally,(as I still am!)but especially if they wore big glasses,which I thought were the best thing out. A favourite example being Lynda Carter on WonderWoman.I am sure that it is only a matter of a pretty short time before large glasses become very fashionable again.  Peter</p><p></p><hr>

My girlfriend has been wearing them for a couple of months around my house, and says that she didn't know how bad her vision was until she wore them as she has only got a very mild prescription.  </p><p> </p><p>so it's worked out well both of us - I've got some nice collectible dt's, and she can see a lot better now!!! </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420014235/http://www.gwgs.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.GwGs.co.uk/</a> </p><p> </p><p>Click on the link below for Ebay's collection of eyeglasses for sale: </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150420014235/http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&amp;ht=1&amp;SortProperty=MetaEndSort&amp;query=eyeglasses" target="_blank">http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&amp;ht;=1&amp;SortProperty;=MetaEndSort&amp;query;=eyeglasses</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hearty</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2001, 17:00</p><p>Wurm ~ </p><p>That's a good point, I suppose that would apply to the antique frames as well. </p><p>I will inherit a pair of glasses that were my great grandfather's...they have very thin, bendable wire temples and the lenses are very tiny ovals, glass of course. They seem on the plus side but funky too, so I'm guessing astigmatism. Someone elses glasses are such a personal object, to see how they peered at the world in their own, unique way.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2001, 10:21</p><p>Hearty, </p><p> </p><p>Some cheap sunglasses actually have pretty durable frames. Most are probably inappropriate for prescription lenses. An optician will probably tell you that a lab can try to put lenses in them, but they can't guarantee the frames won't crack and bust, either at lens insertion or afterwards.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hearty</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2001, 10:18</p><p>PS....can they put RX lenses into dimestore sunglass frames? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hearty</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2001, 10:14</p><p>Hi Wurm, those sound cool, and you just gave me an idea, I never thought about attending estate sales...do they often have glasses available? </p><p>I dont suppose this msg. quite fits here either, but since I have a kid in college and my funds are limited, I have developed an off-shoot passion for drugstore sunglasses. It seems they are putting out lots of funky styles lately, maybe because summer's over up North, and they have to have an angle to sell them....but it has become almost a compulsion to pick up a pair while I'm buying my bottled water and eyeliner. I have to watch myself, because I could buy too many, I mean there is no end to the new ones that keep coming out! I tend to go for either wires with a light bluish tint, or plastics in a modified cat-eye shape, my latest are pealized clearish with rhinestones. </p><p>Hearty</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fathom</b>&nbsp;12 Nov 2001, 17:49</p><p>This post doesn't fit exactly into this thread, but I wasn't sure where else to put it.... </p><p> </p><p>Trent, I hope you're reading this!  Some months back I'd been wondering if I was going to be taxed by Customs Canada for buying frames (without lenses) from U.S.-based online retailers and you were wondering the same.  I recently purchased three frames from theyedoctor.com and wasn't taxed a cent on them. :)  (BTW, I live in BC.) </p><p> </p><p>Quite strange, because when I buy just frames from Lenscrafters or one of the Iris Group stores they charge me the entire 14%.  Some of the smaller optical stores, on the other hand, don't.  I'm not really sure if the larger stores were going by-the-book or have been taxing extraneously -- although I've been told that once you get the prescription filled in you can get a tax refund. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2001, 14:29</p><p>The Alain Mikli zebra frames are even cooler on second look: the white zebra stripes are raised and pearlized. Very funky!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2001, 15:36</p><p>I made a couple of interesting finds today:  </p><p> </p><p>From an estate sale: A pair of older tortoise sunglasses with brass trim overlaid on the temples and bridge. On the inside of the temples "Miss America". Green lenses. </p><p> </p><p>From a house sale: A pair of Alain Mikli Rx frames with a zebra-stripe pattern on the front! Pretty wild. Plus bifocals with a tint.</p><p></p><hr>
