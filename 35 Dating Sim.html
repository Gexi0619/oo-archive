<p><b>Martyn</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2007, 17:12</p><p>Hi Amy, rather surprised you can,t have myodisc lenses, technology has moved surprisingly quickly over the last few years, I,m sure you could have myodiscs lenses and they would be much thinner, and not be so uncomfortable as your present glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if you have considered lens inplants this is a very successful operation for someone like you. I hope your rx settles down soon, still if your happy with your glasses thats all that matters, and I hope your never judged on your glasses rather  as a normal loving human being with feelings.I don,t wear glasses myself, I don,t have a fetish for glasses, my interest I once worked for an optician.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Drew</b>&nbsp;24 Aug 2005, 10:54</p><p>I`m heavily attracted to girls with really thick minus lenses! It almost drives me mad seeing them how they push up their glasses after they slode down their nose. I dont think this is normal! Am I ill?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Herb</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2005, 14:09</p><p>After having found this site, i think I can second the plus-guy before. </p><p> </p><p>Beeing a rather nearsighted (-12 dpt.) guy wearing glasses in the  </p><p>age of 39/190cm/85kg, interested in arts &amp; crafts and foreign cultures, </p><p>I would be very pleased to find my female counterpart, and of course </p><p>I love highmyopic ladies with glasses! </p><p> </p><p>Regards </p><p>Herb        (h-j-k@gmx.at)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Plus Eyes</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2005, 07:00</p><p>The question is asked why do we find ladies attractive and sexy wearing thick glasses, well I think behind the thicck glasses, is a shy person who knows about the cruel jibs they had to endure because of their glasses, yet for all that they have become very attractive warm caring people, and behind the glasses there are usually the most beautiful eyes, when the glasses are slipped off reveal the true beauty of the eyes. </p><p> </p><p>About 10 years ago I dated a lady with an Rx of +14 she was so shy and withdrawn when I first met her, she had never socialised, did not like going to clubs or being the company of men because men never ever asked her out. </p><p> </p><p>After dating her for 2 years she gained confidence realising her glasses were not a hinderance to her enjoying life and socialising. Unfortunately she went off to college, far from where I lived, she meet a nice guy married has children, I think there are guys like me who see beyond the thick glasses, she the real person and personality behind the glasses, and why should glasses be an issue when dating a lady. </p><p> </p><p>So to all ladies who have to wear very high Rx glasses either plus or minus you will always have a special place in my thoughts, because of the adversity you have overcome because of your glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AA</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2005, 05:58</p><p>Amy looking forward to your next post to see what your new RX ism Amy you say your lenses are an inch thick, are those high index lenses, or just normal glass. or maybe High index lenses are too expensive. I always have a soft spot for anyone who has had to wear strong glasses such as yours, because I,m sure you had to put up with cruel jokes about your glasses in your younger days, I,m sure socially you never considered yourself attractive because of your glasses, well I,m sure behind the glasses is a lovely lady with a beautiful personality, and i,m sure your also physically attractivem this compliment from a guy who does not wear glasses. AAx</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>AA</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2005, 17:55</p><p>Hi Amy you seem a real nice lady warm and gentle, of course your glasses would attract guys like me, after all looks do count, some guys go for other attributes I happen to like ladies who wear strong glasses, will it surprise you if I tell you I don,t wear glasses myself. I hope your eyes stabilise soon and they don,t get much thicker, you seem to have picked a nice pair of glasses I,m sure you look beautiful glasses or no glasses. I hope one day you will be confident enough to post a photo of your glasses. Look forward to reading your posts. Take care AA x</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest 3</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2004, 16:03</p><p>Hi Amy, fantastic your RX has not increased,maybe by your next eye test your astigmatism will be stable, wonderful news so pleased for you, it would be nice to see a photo of your glasses if possible. Look forward to more posts. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Don</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2004, 12:32</p><p>Hi Amy, I'm really glad your eye exam went well.I hope your increase's slow down for you.Talk to you later. Don</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amy</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2004, 00:14</p><p> Had my exam, and things went well. Only needed to increase the astigmatism part of my prescription. As the lenses were applied to the machine the clarity was awesome, but it felt like my eye muscles were being tweaked. Never had that sensation before.I asked about myodisc lenses, but due to the astigmatism they are not doable.The optician said that the new lenses will be only slighty thicker than the ones I wear now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest 3</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2004, 05:01</p><p>Hi Amy, you would be surprised how many guys like ladies wearing glasses, a survey over here was done recently and the results found 80 percent of guys found ladies wearing glasses attractive and sexy looking, but the survey also showed guys would not admit to their male friends they would rather date a lady in glasses, so Amy the next time a guy makes eyes at you he is saying I find you attractive.I hope your eye exam goes well and the increase is small, because even though we love you and your glasses, would not want you to have your sight impaired further. Thanks for answering my post says a lot for your genuineness and personality. goodluck.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Don</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2004, 00:56</p><p>Hi Amy,Yes it sounds like he likes women in glasses just as much as I do.Hope your exam go's well.Talk to you later. Don</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amy</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2004, 23:43</p><p>Guest 3 and Don, Until a friend told me about this site,I always thought that guys found glasses like mine unattractive. Glad guys like you exist. I did have a boyfrind that always wanted to go with me to my eye exams.He would ask the doctor if he could watch the exam, and always wanted to look thru my glasses. Do you think he is like you guys at this site?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Don</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2004, 08:40</p><p>Hi Amy, I just want to tell you that I'm sorry you need a increase in your Rx.But I think ladies in strong glasses are very Attractive. I prefer a women with glasses over one with out glasses.I look forward to reading your reply. Don</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest 3</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2004, 03:56</p><p>Hi Amy, gosh at 27 and your ever increasing RX and thicker lenses must be concerning you, it all very well for we guys who love ladies wearing glasses especially if they are as short sighted as you Amy. I,m sure I speak for all guys there is no way we would wish your RX to increase, rather the opposite and have your RX stablilises. Amy lets pray and hope the increase in your Rx is very small and gives you some hope for the future, I would love to be in touch with you to give you moral support, unfortunately not wise to give e mail address out here for reasons I,m sure you understand Amy. Look forward to your next post Amy and lets hope you have some good news. Guest3</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Amy</b>&nbsp;03 Aug 2004, 00:13</p><p>Yeah, I'd like to play too! I'm a 27 year old female who wears strong glasses for myopia . Rimless frames with lenses that are flat on the front, and about one inch thick at the edges. Need more correction again, as things are getting blurred again. Have an appointment Thur. so hopefully will be seeing better after that. New glasses are very hard for me to adjust to.Find it hard to get used to everything getting smaller, but the upside things are sharper.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dez</b>&nbsp;05 Nov 2002, 06:15</p><p>So, nobody has other ideas?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lazysiow</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2002, 07:06</p><p>you could still have the prescription info in there. Just have in a a separate screen like a popup where people can click on it if they want to see the girls' prescriptions. Otherwise just in their bios, describe what they cant see just so people who don't care about the technical stuff can still get an idea (and a kick out of) their bad eyesight i.e. "she once stubbornly tried to go around outside not wearing her glasses and couldnt see anything to cross the road and was nearly hit by a truck"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dez</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2002, 10:37</p><p>Oh... and none of these girls should be embarassed about their glasses or try to go out without them, since it is a boarding school where all the girls wear glasses... Teachers, staff, students, everyone. </p><p> </p><p>The only males around are the hero of the game and the janitor, and they don't wear glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dez</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2002, 10:28</p><p>heh, thanks MZ ^^ </p><p> </p><p>Just some info : You don't have to talk about contact lenses, they don't exist in the setting. Or maybe they do, but nobody has them. Also, Ellen has to wear the strongest lenses. Narumi is not supposed to be that blind. Ellen and Akari have the strongest lenses, one plus, the other minus. And all the girl's appearances are already determined, I only miss the glasses info... Ellen has short blond hair and freckles, while Mako has frizzy brown hair tied in a ponytail. Also, Mako's lenses are prescription sunglasses. She never shows her eyes, so nobody know what they look like... </p><p> </p><p>I don't want all them girls to wear thick glasses because, well, the aim of the game is to please a large crowd, not just a couple of hard core glasses fetishists like you! (and me I guess... I'm hooked).. if it gets too technical, the game will probably freak them out... </p><p> </p><p>Oh... and these girls don't look asian anyway, they just look like manga characters, all with big eyes and brightly colored hair.. I'll show you the pictures when everything is done!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MZ</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2002, 09:44</p><p>Ellen Takahashi  </p><p> </p><p>Age : 16  </p><p> </p><p>Vision : medium high myopia. Rx, LE: -11.75D, -2.00D cyl X 125°, RE: -12.75D, -2.00D cyl X 47°.  Must wear glasses with thick lenses (15 mm at the edges).  Tried contacts but could not tollerate them for long wearing peroids to make them practical.  Shy because of having to wear glasses with such thick lenses and essentially became a bookworm as an escape for her appearance.  Actually now that she has matured, she is quite good looking with long pretty black hair, a nice shape, and quite pretty eyes, execpt that you cannot see them very well behind her thick lenses.  Although being shy, when one gets to know her, she has a very pleasant personality and is a delightful girl. She sometimes tries to go without her glasses but is quite blind without them and cannot function very well.  even working on her computer, she has to wear special glasses.  She is now become somewhat popular because of her knowledge about computers. </p><p> </p><p>Character Type : Shy, bookworm, computer wiz  </p><p> </p><p>Correction : very strong minus  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Mako Miura  </p><p> </p><p>Age : 18  </p><p> </p><p>Character Type : Arrogant, popular girl  </p><p> </p><p>Correction : medium plus. Rx, LE: +6.75D, +3.00D cyl X 145°; RE: +7.50D, +3.00D cyl X 25°.  Has to wear her glasses all of the time to see up-close and even far.  Everything is quite blurred for her without them.  She also has tried contacts, but the unusual prescription and high astigmatism is difficult to correct with contacts had her vision with them is not as good as with her glasses, so she mostly wear her glasses.  She has worn glasses most of her life and she developed a somewhat arrogant personality to overcome her feelings of inadaquacy.  With the right people, she is not arrogant and actually is quite pleasant person to be arround.  She had her eyes modified a year ago so as to be less Asian and now the plus lenses magnify her eyes, which are quite pretty looking with an apparent almond shape. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Narumi Araizumi  </p><p> </p><p>Age : 16  </p><p> </p><p>Character Type : Perfect girl, too nice to be true  </p><p> </p><p>Correction : Strong minus.  Unfortunately, Narumi was born with high myopia and got her first glasses when she was 1 yr old.  The Rx was -10D for both eyes.  Now, at 16, her Rx is: LE: -20.75D, -5.00D cyl X 45°; RE: -22.50D, -5.75D cyl X 45°.  Her glasses require myodisc lenses.  Even wearing her glasses, her vision is only 20/70 for both eyes and she cannot recognize anyone farther away than 3 meters and has to get close to every thing to really see things well, especially small things.  She cannot read street signs or see bus numbers and her night vision is almost nonexistent.  When she goes out at night she has to go with someone else to help her.  She must have special glasses for reading and working on her computer. </p><p>Earyl on, she developed a pleasing personality to over come her handicap of having to wear very strong glasses to see anything and even then not seeing all that well.  But, even so, she is a popular girl because of her personality and naturlly pretty face and hair.  Unfortunately, her eyes are not always easy to see behind her unusual glasses.  When she takes her glasses of to rest her eyes, one can see that they are quite pretty, even thought they look somewhat vacant because she is blind with her glasses.  She also has tried contacts, but the very high Rx and something about the base curve of her eyes, made the contacts pop off frequently and she could not find them because of her poor eyesight.  Contacts were just not practical for her. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dez</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2002, 17:15</p><p>well, nearsightedness is myopia, so what's the real name of farsightedness? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>girnur</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2002, 16:05</p><p>I´ll give it a try to answer your question. </p><p>Farsightedness is when the eyeball are to short. That will make the picture of the object you´re looking at focus "behind" the back of your eye. To a degree yuo can accomodate for this with your eyelens just like in a camera. </p><p>But often this leads to eyestrain and headache and such. When you put a pluslens in front of the eye it will help the lens to get the focus right. </p><p>When you´re presbyopic it´s not your eyeball that´s too short but the muscles that do the focusing of the lens in the eye that are getting old. So they can´t do the job properly anymore. Here also the pluslens have the same effect. It will help the lens in the eye to get the focus right. It´s the same solution but different causes. </p><p>I hope I got that right:)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dez</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2002, 14:39</p><p>So, both hyperopia and presbyopia require plus lenses... I don't know much about lenses... are they similar? </p><p> </p><p>and what is regular farsightedness? </p><p>does it exist? or is it an early form of presbyopia?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2002, 13:43</p><p>Dez/Etienne </p><p>I agree that you see strong plus lenses on little kids and old people. In the case of old people - it's usually because the muscles controlling their eye lenses have siezed up. The condition is known as presbyopia and it generally becomes apparent some time after the mid-40s. It leaves people unable to focus on close-up things without the use of plus lenses. In the case of little kids - I believe eye tests are picking up hyperopia more often than in previous years. Hyperopic kids can usually function fairly well without glasses - up to a certain point - but wearing glasses certainly relieves them of some of the strain of accommodating all the time. As for astigmatism - I have -2.00 of astigmatism and I don't think anyone could notice that while I'm wearing my glasses. However - anyone looking through my glasses while rotating the lenses would notice the image distorting significantly while they did it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dez</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2002, 12:18</p><p>Oi! </p><p>(I'm Etienne, but I'm doing to use my usual Nickname, since it feels weird seeing my real name on the net) </p><p> </p><p>I know farsighted people need plus lenses while nearsighted people need minus ones and it's easy for me to tell the difference between the two... </p><p> </p><p>Well, for starters, how does astigmatism affect the lenses? And how come most people I see in real life with strong plus lenses are little kids and old people? </p><p> </p><p>I don't need to describe the frames in the character descriptions since all of the girls wear the same ones. It's part of their uniform, remember! Only the lenses matter for now. Maybe they have alternate pairs when they're not in school, but our design phase is not there yet :) </p><p> </p><p>This stuff matters in the game : Our hero has an older brother who's an agent for some government agency. His brother ask him to help him in a job he cannot do since he is too old. He has to go to a certain school and find information about a student there. The only information is has is the fact the girl wears glasses, and he knows the prescription. However, things get tough when he realizes all the students going to that school are girls and all wear glasses. He will have to try to know these girls better if he can ever succeed in finding the one he's looking for!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2002, 11:39</p><p>Atienne, </p><p> </p><p>This sounds pretty neat.  There is certainly a wealth of information here.  A lot of the people who post here can speak/write for days about various visual traits. </p><p> </p><p>Besides your characters' vision, you might also describe their glasses - plastic, metal, rimless, hi-index (thinner lenses), regular plastic (or CR39, thicker lenses).  Rectangular, oval, round, cat-eye... </p><p> </p><p>I think you might also want to try reading some of the stories that have been posted.  The stories are mostly posted on their own threads (so there's the "Post Your Prescription" thread, which is where people post their prescriptions, and there are a bunch of threads that sound like names of stories - which they are).  These stories, though, are mostly about fictional and rare types of glasses-wearers.  For more 'normal' types, try reading the "Post your prescription" and "Acuity and Prescription (II)" threads.  These will give you a lot of ideas. </p><p> </p><p>Do you have specific questions?  You do seem to know some things about vision.  You've heard of nearsighted and farsighted and astigmatism.  Most young people who wear glasses are nearsighted, some are farsighted, and most have a small amount of astigmatism (irregularly shaped eye that blurs vision at all distances).  Some have a more significant amount of astigmatism. </p><p> </p><p>There is a lot more, but I'm not sure where to start.  Sounds like a great project, though!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Etienne</b>&nbsp;28 Oct 2002, 09:23</p><p>Hello! </p><p> </p><p>I desperately need help... I don't know much about vision but I need some info for a project I'm working on, and I guess you guys would be the perfect source. </p><p> </p><p>The project is a Dating Sim. It's a video game genre popular in japan but completely unknown in north america in which you play the role of some young guy trying to score with the local girls... These games are heavily story based and you navigate trough them with a text based interface. Most of the window display the character you're interacting with and at the bottom of the screen is a text window telling the story and offering you choices of what to do next... </p><p> </p><p>This is only a fan project, of course. A couple of people got together on the net and decided to make that kind of game just for the heck of it. However, our dating sim has a twist : All the girls in the game wear glasses, as the story takes place in an high school for girls where glasses are part of the school's uniform :) </p><p> </p><p>All the girls in the school have vision problems, and I must detail them... However, I must detail them in the character bios and this where my problem is. I don't know a thing about vision, and I think saying : "far-sighted" and "near-sighted"  for all the girls wouldn't be very cool... </p><p> </p><p>What I would like to do is something like this : </p><p>Name : Akari Miyazaki </p><p>Age : 16 </p><p>Vision Problem : Myopia </p><p>Glasses Correction : -3 / -3.25 </p><p> </p><p>I want all the girls to be as varied as possible, from myopia to astygmatism and stuff... but I don't know much about it... Can you help me, or at least, do you know how where I could get some in-depth info? </p><p> </p><p>thanks in advance </p><p>Etienne</p><p></p><hr>
