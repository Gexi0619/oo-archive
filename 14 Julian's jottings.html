<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2015, 09:05</p><p>Julian, </p><p> </p><p>I assume that being myopic in one eye and hyperopic in the other would give him monovision. I think that the myopic eye woulg give him good reading vision.The other eye might not be good at any distance if he is astigmatic enough.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2015, 03:33</p><p>My first jotting here for over four months - how are the mighty fallen! </p><p>Went last night to see a new vicar installed at a strange church. Arrived at the last moment (when there were no service sheets left) and had to sit at the back, on a plastic chair. One consolation was that the chair in front of me was occupied by a slim young man with black hair, beard and glasses (also black). As the service took its INTERMINABLE course I was able to observe him, noticing a very neat backside, covered by tight blue trousers; also the rather different lenses in his glasses: the left lens was low minus; the right was a rather stronger plus, with a substantial cylinder component. Made me wonder what his bareyed vision would be like, and at what age his need for glasses would have become obvious.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2014, 07:29</p><p>Watched 'Bargain Hunt' on BBC-1 today and Jonathan Pratt (whom I've mentioned before) was the auctioneer - never without his gold semi-rimless glasses. With careful observation, the lenses are definitely low minus (as I originally thought) and he looks really good in them...he's also a thoroughly pleasant guy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andrew</b>&nbsp;29 Aug 2014, 12:01</p><p>Like you, Julian, I am mildly amused to see so many people choosing to wear glasses which do not look dissimilar to those which we all tried to avoid some 30-40 years ago.  Actually, I agree that they don't look too bad, although I certainly did not feel that way when I was made to get my first pair of NHS glasses back in 1978.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Aug 2014, 06:34</p><p>Over the last couple of years I've posted a few times about a good-looking young man called Scott, working in Tesco (very tall, very slim, short hair, short sight). A year or so ago he transferred from the checkout to the Fruit &amp; Veg. Team, stocking shelves and so on. I hadn't seen any sign of him for month and months, and had decided he'd gone to work somewhere else - till yesterday, when there he was. First, he and another guy were pushing a big trolley around, and I got a quick 'hullo' from him. A bit later he'd gone to man a checkout; but he was so busy that in the end I gave up trying to get there and went to another checkout. What I did notice, however, is that he's got new glasses: black plastic with a white line along the middle of each temple. OK, but less interesting than his old ones: black fronts, wide black temples with a white cobwebby pattern; and his second pair was similar, but with white temples with a black pattern. Wonder if he has a second pair again...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 May 2014, 06:11</p><p>As most people here will know, I've always had a penchant for guys in glasses; but lately there seems to be a fashion for what look like (but aren't quite) classic NHS plastic frames, the sort of thing I didn't like but was made to wear when I was 18. And I'm finding them very attractive (on the right face of course). I'm also enjoying the sight of round wire frames, whether plastic covered à la Harry Potter or plain. Curious, I suppose, how one's taste follows fashion.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 May 2014, 16:40</p><p>Back in September I jotted about a newly-bespectacled teenage lad who lives a few doors from me and used to be an altar server in church (but not any more). I see him around occasionally, never without his glasses, and have had a couple of conversations recently. Today I was able to get a proper look at his lenses and they are definitely minus but not strong - no more than -2, if that. Apparently he had perfect vision last year (maybe just school screening, I don't know) but within a couple of months was complaining he couldn't see. For my money his basic black plastic frames really suit him. More interesting, today he was wearing shorts, so I had a view of moderately muscular calves and very neat ankles. Don't know his age - maybe 16; 17 at the most. </p><p>Before anyone jumps in, he's just a moderately pleasant sight, and may improve with keeping 8-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2014, 11:53</p><p>I posted about a month ago about 'Bargain Hunt' on BBC-1. I watch it fairly regularly  and the lovely Jonathan Pratt has appeared a few times as an expert - no glasses. Today he was the auctioneer, and was never seen without his black, or maybe dark tortoiseshell, framed glasses. Watching carefully as he conducted the auction, I was pretty sure there was a substantial cylinder in each lens. But why should he wear them as auctioneer but not as an expert? One possibility is they're actually progressives - and he might wear contacts when he's guiding  people round, but need progressives as auctioneer Another is that the programmes where he's bareyed were recorded before his got these specs! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2014, 20:46</p><p>Went shopping for a few items this afternoon at ASDA ('part of the Wal-Mart family') and then decided to have a cup of coffee at the cafeteria, where I was served by a highly desirable young man in glasses - black wire frames, minus lenses, not negligible but not extremely strong either. The store stays open 24 hours, but the cafeteria was closing up, and he was moving around clearing up, so I was able to enjoy the view of his neat slim figure, nicely curved backside, short brown hair and a suggestion of designer stubble (or perhaps he just hadn't shaved). His lenses seemed to be thicker at the outside edges, so I wondered if he had some base-out prism, but that may have ben my imagination.  </p><p>Incidentally there were quite a few guys in shorts around the streets, one in particular with muscular calves, tanned and quite hairy...no glasses though. I suppose you can't have everything.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2014, 20:38</p><p>Great - welcome back, Dom! I've been looking back at some of the old posts, and it struck me that back then photos of Elijah in glasses were like gold dust, but now he seems to be a full time wearer when he isn't actually acting, Looks good in glasses too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dom</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2014, 19:39</p><p>The very same. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dave</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2014, 13:20</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Julian -- Always enjoy your sightings!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2014, 03:26</p><p>Dom: are you the Dom we all knew and loved who opted out of EyeScene a few years ago?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dom</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2014, 19:51</p><p>I've just been reading the Eyescene threads from 2000. Gosh, we took those discussions seriously. The minute attention paid to Elijah Wood's Rx strikes me as positively comic now; but what a thrill it was to discover his myopia!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2014, 14:38</p><p>Long time since I posted to this thread; I hope nobody gets annoyed! </p><p>Most days at lunch time I enjoy a TV programme on BBC-1 called 'Bargain Hunt'. two teams of two, the 'Reds' and the 'Blues', are each given £300 and sent off to an antique fair or something of the sort, with the help of an expert, to buy three items each in an hour. Any money left over is given to the expert, to find a 'bonus buy'. The items are then sold at auction (the contestants can choose whether to include the bonus buy) and any profit is theirs to take away. Quite often the auctioneer is someone who appears as an 'expert' on other occasions. </p><p>One day last week I watched with particular interest. That day the teams each consisted of a guy and a girl. One of the guys had a lot of black hair and beard, and heavy dark famed glasses, minus I think, which didn't suit him all that well. When it came to the auction (another day maybe) he was a lot less hairy and wearing different glasses: black wire aviators, altogether more becoming. The other guy was also wearing glasses this time: black plastic frames and, I think, low minus lenses. He had black hair and designer stubble, and the whole effect was good.  </p><p>As for the auctioneer, he's a regular as either auctioneer or expert, called Jonathan Pratt, early 40s, quite good-looking and very pleasant. A while back he used to appear in glasses, semi-rimless I think, when he was selling as auctioneer, and I decided he was a bit myopic and put his glasses on to see who was bidding. More recently I hadn't seen him in glasses at all, and decided he must have gone int contacts. Last week however, he had glasses on throughout the proceedings, moderately heavy black frames which I thought didn't suit him all that well. I couldn't be sure about his Rx, but at one time it looked like low plus with cylinder. </p><p>The other spexy guy is the master of ceremonies, so to speak, Tim Wonnacott, who seems to be wearing different 'half-moon' readers every time he appears, usually bright colours, sometimes striped or otherwise patterned, sometimes matching his bow tie.  </p><p>Believe it or not, it isn't for the specs I watch this show!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Not Bush</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2013, 10:52</p><p>The Republican politicians, with a bit of help from the Democrat politicians, have turned the U.S. into a third-world country.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Krieger</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2013, 05:27</p><p>@astigmaphile Coming from a third world country myself, I cannot say we are unable to get our eyesight problems dealt with. Sorry you have such a concieted mind.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2013, 11:50</p><p>Galileo, </p><p> </p><p>I was aware that you were talking about Africa. I should feel grateful that I don't live in a third world country where people can't afford basic health care. On top of poverty it must make life very hard for them if they can't see very well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2013, 09:35</p><p>Astigmaphile - sorry I should have made it clear that when I was talking about seeing mainly astigmatism corrections I was talking about West Africa. </p><p> </p><p>There is an issue across Africa of affordability which means probably more people should be wearing glasses than do.  However when I look around I really do think I see a lot of low Rx for myopia and hyperopia and an awful lot of cylinder corrections. </p><p> </p><p>No idea if it is true or just my perception :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2013, 16:26</p><p>Galileo, </p><p> </p><p>I find the promenence of high cylinder interesting. I am a real lens watcher and I go months without seeing anything stronger than my own correction. I see loads of against the rule cyl in old people's prescriptions but it usually isn't very strong. We ghave a branch of the University of California in Santa Barbara and most of the college kids are myopes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2013, 15:36</p><p>@Cactus Jack and Julian,  </p><p> </p><p>I was wondering about this in a different context.  I'm spending a lot of time travelling between South East Asia and Africa recently.  I've noticed the predominance (well reported elsewhere) of myopia in SE Asia, but hardly see any mid/high myopes in Africa.   </p><p> </p><p>The most obvious strong corrections I am seeing here are astigmatism, lots of Rx with high levels of cylinder, maybe with almost negligible myopia and slightly more frequently low hyperopia</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2013, 14:24</p><p>Another thought:  </p><p>&gt;rubella is the most common cause of congenital deafness in the developed world </p><p>Time was when we might have blamed syphilis for that - and blindness.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2013, 14:20</p><p>Thanks for that post, Cactus. It gave me quite a lot to think about and research. i investigate. I was aware of the dangers of rubella in early pregnancy...the plot of one of Agatha Christie's novels hinges on it ('The mirror crack'd from side to side') and it can cause far worse things than bad eyesight. In one of the stories I posted on Bobby's site a while back ('The secret diary of Hadrian Vole') I put in a pair of identical twins with thick minus glasses and hearing aids, caused by their mother catching rubella while she was carrying them and I said 'theyre lucky to have got off with bad eyesight and bad hearing'. You had me worried about hyperopia rather than myopia being the result; but a google search for rubella showed me either can result. A couple of extracts: </p><p>1. rubella is the most common cause of congenital deafness in the developed world </p><p>2. Eye defects including cataracts, congenital glaucoma, pigmentary retinopathy (50% - so-called 'salt and pepper'), severe myopia, microphthalmia. </p><p>So there we are!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2013, 00:56</p><p>Julian, </p><p>I may be way off on this, but just like many asian populations have a strong genetic tendency toward myopia, I think populations in the UK and perhaps northern Europe have a genetic tendency toward hyperopia.  I have no way to prove it.  </p><p>Sometimes extreme hyperopia is caused by diseases contracted by the mother during gestation.  Rubella (sometimes called 3 day or German Measles) is famous for damaging eyes developing in the womb.  Often it affects development of the crystalline lenses which leaves a baby with a lifetime of very high hyperopia in addition to other birth defects.  The crystalline lens usually contributes about 40% of the total plus power of the eye's lens system. </p><p>There is another condition called Micropthalmia where the eye does not develop properly after a baby is born and is very hyperopic.  If you are interested, Google Micropthalmia for more information. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2013, 21:44</p><p>Cactus: sorry, I told my story badly. The two boys weren't brothers; they weren't together. They weren't even in the same supermarket! But thanks for the exposition.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2013, 19:49</p><p>Julian, </p><p>I think very high hyperopia in children, such as you described, is genetic in origin and also manifest more redly than myopia.  Almost all children are born with very significant hyperopia because their eyeballs must be small to fit in their small eye sockets.  Fortunately, almost all children also have have extreme accommodation range that they will envy with they get to their 40s. </p><p>Typically, it takes about a month for a baby to learn how to use his ciliary muscles and crystalline lenses and use that accommodation to focus.  It is believed that focusing effort triggers the production of specific eyeball growth hormone(s) that causes the eyeball to grow as the head grows and the eye sockets get larger.  If the eyeball grows to much, myopia develops. If it does not grow enough, hyperopia persists. If it works just right, neither one develops.  Visual environment during the growth period can also be a factor. </p><p>If something goes wrong with the process and the eyeball fails to grow or something goes wrong in the focus control process the problem is often manifest by obvious things such as inability to recognize parents at any distance, or by the eyes crossing as the interconnection between the focus control system and the eye positioning control system in the brain comes into play.  Problems with myopia are harder to discern unless the myopia is very severe or the child has learned to read and cannot see distance well enough to read the board in class or distant signs. </p><p>In the situation you described with the two brothers (?), the problem is likely hereditary and either one or both of the parents are significantly hyperopic (most often the mother).  Sometimes there will be twins who are both hyperopic and also have other sensory problems such as poor hearing. </p><p>Myopia can also be hereditary where all the children in the family develop high myopia at an early age and sometimes become significantly more myopic than the parents. </p><p>Eyeball size seems to be the most common cause of mismatch between he power of the eye's lens system and the length or the eyeball, but it is also possible that the lens system has too much plus power (myopia) or too little plus power (hyperopia) to focus images properly on the retina. </p><p>If you happen to see them again, look around for the parent(s).  As hyperopic adults, they may be wearing contacts so the hyperopia may not be obvious. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2013, 15:53</p><p>A couple of hours' shopping this afternoon took me into two supermarkets where I saw two young boys with plus glasses, both in quite smart black frames. The second one's lenses I'd call very strong; the first e-x-t-r-e-m-e-l-y  strong  (he was younger). Thinks: it seems to me that plus lenses are commoner on young kids than minus. Am I right? </p><p>There was also a rather older boy in a smart pair of specs: some plus in them and quite a lot of cylinder. </p><p>Finally, some more Blockbusters. I was away last week and recorded them and I'm catching up...they're screened in the middle of the night. There was a really cute youth made quite a long experience: tall and athletic, prominent adam's apple, round gold wire frames, lenses neither strong plus nor strong minus.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2013, 18:52</p><p>Watching more Blockbusters, it strikes me how many of the bespectacled boys back then opted for aviators. The three I jotted about in my last post were a bit out of fashion with their round frames.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;21 Oct 2013, 07:10</p><p>I really enjoy an old quiz programme called Blockbusters, which is being re-screened on GOLD, one of the UK satellite channels. The contestants were, I guess, sixth-formers from various schools, aged about 18, one competing against two. The other day there was a sequence where all three contestants were boys, all wearing round glasses. The single one had ginger hair and brown plastic frames; one of his opponents had shoulder length black hair and black wire high joint frames, and the other (the best-looking of the three) had wavy dark hair and gold wire frames, low joint. In due course the single contestant was eliminated and his place was taken by a girl, who was also wearing round glasses (gold wire). These contests were originally screened in about 1992, and it's interesting to speculate what's become of these youngsters, and what they look like now. </p><p>There was another edition shown recently where the better-looking of two boys,  (fair hair, clear complexion, dimples) after winning one round, put on a pair of gold-rimmed glasses for the next, not obviously strong minus or plus. At his next appearance he'd taken them off, and they didn't appear again. </p><p>Earlier this year there was a new series of Blockbusters with a new host (the old one having died) and adult contestants. But, not just for that reason, it wasn't half the fun of the old programme.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2013, 10:08</p><p>A couple of recent sightings in church. </p><p>1. One of the teenage lads who serve at the altar turned up the other Sunday wearing glasses which I hadn't seen him in before. He lives a few doors along from me and I haven't seen him without his glasses since. He's no great beauty - bad posture, untidy hair, braces on his teeth - but I have to say he looks better (and presumably sees better) in glasses. The frames are basic black plastic like NHS frames; lenses I'm not sure about but I think low minus. </p><p>2. The other guy's a bit older, home from university, sitting right up in front with his parents. Not very prepossessing, with a very regrettable attempt at a beard, and terrible fingernails, uncared for and bitten::( His only redeeming feature was his glasses - really nice rimless with fancy plastic nosepiece and temples, and strong minus lenses, maybe -5 or -6.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;14 Jul 2013, 10:26</p><p>"regardless of age"   --  that says it all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Jul 2013, 10:22</p><p>At a wedding yesterday. Big 'official' party: as well as the best man and the bride's father there were nine bridesmaids, a page boy and two ring bearers, one for each ring. The ring bearers were young lads, about ten years old, with the same surname as the bridegroom, and pretty much alike. Might have been brothers, perhaps even twins, but one of them, only, wore glasses. Black plastic frames as currently popular, and the strongest minus lenses I've seen on a child in I don't know how long, with plano fronts. He seemed on the whole to function quite well, but I noticed he had been given a large print hymn sheet, and held it pretty close to his eyes. </p><p>Before anyone starts on me, let me say. not for the first time, that I am no kind of paedophile, but an optic obsessive regardless of the age of the subject. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2013, 02:25</p><p>Shopping in Tesco last night, I had a couple of glimpses of a group of three or four young guys, one of whom - well! Lean, tanned, medium fair hair, shorts which showed his muscular calves, and glasses - such glasses! Semi-rimless frames, reddish-brown in colour, and the most spectacularly strong plus lenses, which might have had quite a lot of cylinder. Thinking about it afterwards, I suspect he might just have been having a break from contacts, as the specs looked very new. But he was a lovely sight on a hot summer evening.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Apr 2013, 09:39</p><p>I was in Tesco again the other evening to get a few items, and Scott was on duty again - it seems as if he works evenings - so naturally I made my way to his checkout. He was wearing the glasses I first saw him in, black temples with white pattern. Must have been a 2 for 1 offer when he got them. I was able to get a better look at his lenses, and my last observation was wrong. His left lens is minus, as I thought, but the one on the right is, I think, plus with quite a lot of cylinder. So an interesting and quite complex prescription for a cute and very pleasant young man.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;16 Jan 2013, 19:22</p><p>Hi Julian </p><p> </p><p>Mabe you remember me, a few of years I posted here some storys. Longtime I not was in Eyescene, because I moved a 3 years ago to Thailand where I live now. I had a lot of working for my new place and longtime I not have Internet, because I live upcountry in Northern Thailand. </p><p> </p><p>I wish you all the best. </p><p> </p><p>Many greetings from  </p><p> </p><p>Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2012, 11:53</p><p>A couple of things on the Tesco front. The other day I was shopping there and the lovely Scott was on duty at the till (see my jotting of 6 June) wearing NEW GLASSES! The others, remember, had black temples with a white cobwebby pattern; these have wide white temples with a black pattern and are very striking. He obviously likes wearing glasses, or at any rate likes to make a feature of them. The lenses, by the way, look stronger and are quite unmistakably minus. There's another spexy cashier there too. His badge says his name is Casey; he's neither as tall nor as cute as Scott, but a pleasant lad. His lenses are minus; frames have wire fronts and black temples with a white line along the bottom. Not as exotic as Scott's, but OK.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2012, 09:19</p><p>Some mornings, around 07.00, I see a tall Sikh youth with a turban, black beard and glasses passing my window; I think he does a paper round. The other Saturday I had to catch a train to London and left the house earlier than usual, getting on for 09.00, to drive to the station. He was passing, later than in the week, and I got a good view from the car. He's very tall and slim; his glasses have black and gold frames, and I'd be inclined to say his myopia is not so much high (-6 or more) as extreme - but is there a definition of extreme myopia? Lots of power rings anyway. </p><p>That same morning at St Pancras station I saw a guy, neither young nor cute unfortunately, giving the fiercest squint at a departure board. Then he fished in his bag, took out the case and put on his minus glasses. It's a mystery to me why people who can't see shit persist in going round without correction.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2012, 05:56</p><p>I've decided to start putting my jottings on this thread again; for one thing they are pretty trivial compared with some of the more serious stuff that's on 'Guys in glasses', but some people enjoy them even if others don't - and I don't claim  any monopoly on the right to jot here. In any case this thread is here and may as well be posted on as not. </p><p>OK, so here goes. There's a young couple who come fairly regularly to our church with their baby who was baptized two or three months ago. Yesterday the guy was there on his own with the baby in her buggy, and he was wearing glasses which I don't think I've ever seen before - very nice oblong rimless, with a definite minus Rx, not a first Rx I'd say. I commented on them, expecting him to say he hadn't put his contacts in, but what he said was, 'Yeah, my eyes are getting worse.' My guess is that up to now he has been wearing glasses to drive and leaving them in the car, but is now at the point of needing them full time - or more anyway. What I failed to say was how good they look on him ::(</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Moonshiner</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2012, 21:34</p><p>Deleted several off topic posts. Please keep it on topic and be nice.</p><p></p><hr>



<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2012, 10:28</p><p>In the local Post Office this afternoon, I spotted a tall guy with black hair and a short black beard, black T-shirt, shorts and sandals. Just to complete the picture, he was wearing glasses: dark plastic frames with minus lenses, just strong enough to show some minification. He made the trip worthwhile!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Jul 2012, 18:06</p><p>In London for the weekend, I went out to dinner at a favourite Italian restaurant with a friend (female) who is temporarily in a wheelchair with a badly sprained knee. At the next table, a young couple with a delightful baby girl who was quite a handful. Most of the time, either Mum was nursing her or feeding her, or else Dad was walking her round the room; between them they both managed to have a good meal, but it took time! When the baby looked our way we gave her a little wave and she would wave back, and we all gradually got friendly enough to be told that she was 15 months old. At first glance at the baby I put her down as half Chinese (light skin, oriental eyes) and Mum as full Chinese (darker skin, dark eyes, beautiful long straight black hair, beautiful hands with the long fingers that I always think make for a good pianist. She was dressed smartly while her partner was casual. On the back of his chair was a brightly-coloured jacket with 'Japan' on the back in big letters, and that made me wonder about my initial guess of Chinese. He I should say was of mixed race - his features were kind of oriental but his colouring was not - fair skin (not pink!) and fair hair. There was a pair of glasses lying on the table, black plastic oblongs with some red detail; and when they moved them out of the baby's reach it turned out that the wide temples were bright red. I thought how well they would suit the girl with her black hair and dark eyes. As the meal came to an end, however (we all finished at about the same time) it was the guy  who picked the glasses up and put them on,  rather to my surprise - for one thing although the prescription was significantly minus (not high) there hadn't been a hint of a squint at any point as he walked the baby round the room, and for another the frames looked a bit exotic against his blue jeans and grey T-shirt.  </p><p>We left just before them, and as I was helping my companion from the wheelchair into the car (it was parked on the street right outside the door) our friends came out and gave us a cheerful 'goodnight!' The guy was now wearing his coloured jacket and his glasses looked less exotic, but maybe he looked more oriental!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2012, 01:21</p><p>Shopping at Tesco again, I spotted the ultra-hyperopic Mark whom I mentioned last month, but he wasn't on checkout duty. When I'd got all I needed, I looked along the checkouts and saw another cute boy with glasses. He had a couple of customers and the girl at the next till was free, so I investigated some more goods I didn't want before heading for his till when he was free. He welcomed me with a cheerful grin and I could see from his badge that his name is Scott. He's tall and slim with dark hair and a silly little tuft of fluff on his chin. His glasses have black plastic frames with wide temples with a kind of cobweb pattern in white, At first glance I thought the lenses were plus, but closer inspection revealed some minification through the left lens - could be a complicated case of astigmatism; I'll try to observe another time.  </p><p>Greatly daring, I actually managed to say, "Smart glasses,by the way"! He looked pleased, and said, "Do you like them?" then examined mine and said, "Yours are good too." I've got new specs by the way, with an increase of +0.25 in the distance Rx: white metal fronts and dark blue mottled temples. So with that exchange of compliments I went out into the pouring rain.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 May 2012, 10:21</p><p>Shopping for a few items in my local Tesco, I spotted a checkout manned by a boy in glasses, so naturally... He proved to be a pleasant lad called Mark, with fairish hair cut short, black plastic designer frames, and really s-t-r-o-n-g plus lenses; at first glance they looked like the kind of specs older people used to wear after cataract surgery; he seemed to have to turn his head to look at anything. However, there was a substantial cylinder component to his prescription, judging by the edge thickness at the tops of his lenses. I guess with so much cylinder contacts wouldn't be easy for him to wear either.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2012, 20:54</p><p>Saturday night I went to the pub as I often do for a quiet drink, early evening. No such luck! There was a 'Race Night' on, watching races on TV, backing horses - I didn't entirely understand how it all operated. BUT the TV was some distance away and I kept noticing a cute young guy who was standing by the bar. Every time he looked at the screen he tilted his head back maybe 5 or 10 degrees and gave the merest hint of a squint. I'm just about to move to another part of the country (again) so I shan't get to see his myopia increase till he gets the glasses he doesn't quite need just yet - I wish!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2012, 06:09</p><p>A couple of jottings to celebrate the site being back up. </p><p>1. Two workmen making a ramp to a building here. The younger one is tall, with a lovely slim figure, a good head of wavy brown hair, and glasses (would I be mentioning him without?) The lenses are minus, not all that strong, and the frames black plastic semi-rimless, really well-chosen. </p><p>2. A guy who has been living and working round here for the last 18 months, tall with black hair, blue eyes, fresh complexion and a strong Liverpool accent. Once in a blue moon I used to see him wearing glasses: grey plastic semi-rimless, low minus lenses. A couple of weeks ago I happened to be chatting to him when he had them on, and I took my courage in both hands and said, "I don't often see you wearing glasses; do you usually wear contact lenses?" "Oh no," was the reply; "I'm just obstinate about wearing them. I need them for distances, but I'm getting headaches without them." Since that day, I've seen him without them once - and two minute later they were on again. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2011, 14:20</p><p>I was reminded the other day of my post back in July about heredity and myopia when I met up with a father and his two married sons. I've known them for years, at least since the younger guy was a baby. They all wear glasses: Dad, in his early 60s, has low minus lenses in round gold frames (cultivating some sort of image); elder son (33 or so) moderate minus but definitely stronger than Dad, designer frames, heavy black plastic; younger son strong minus, real coke bottles, with fairly conventional oblong wire frames. Mind you, he has worn quite strong glasses since he was a small boy - I think he has inherited his mother's eyesight; she wears coke bottles too. I first bsaw the elder son in glasses when he was at university.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2011, 03:19</p><p>An interesting sighting (to me anyway): I'm just back from a week's holiday. On the way home I stopped overnight at a bed &amp; breakfast where I've stayed before. When I arrived there was another car in the space where I expected to put mine. The landlady explained that it was her son's, he had to star work early in the morning, so she'd get him to move it out so that I didn't block him in. After a minute or two the son appeared, a pleasant youth, not unattractive: longish fairish hair, jeans &amp; T-shirt. We moved the cars around, and he explained that he had a summer job and had to start work at six in the morning - so I deduced he was a student. In the morning after breakfast and loading the car up, I went to the kitchen to pay my bill; by this time it was a a little after ten. There was the landlady, and also the son, who was putting rashers of streaky bacon on a grill pan - but this time he was wearing glasses, so naturally I was more interested! The frames were fairly plain, bold black plastic as worn by so many these days, and very becoming ('Geeky Horn-Rimmed Glasses are the New âCoolâ'); it wasn't easy in the couple of minutes I was there to get a clear impression of the lenses, but I think they were low plus. The question in mind was not 'why is he wearing them?' but 'why wasn't he wearing them last night?' When I was his age I had (plus) glasses but didn't wear them full time but would almost certainly have been wearing them to read, or watch television, and never got behind the wheel of a car without them. One possibility is that he was snogging with a girlfriend. Another is that he was wearing contacts... </p><p>Earlier I stayed at a farmhouse B&amp;B; where I'd stayed three years ago (and posted about then). There are two sons of the family. The younger, slighter and prettier of the two wears plus glasses; judging by family photos around the place he's worn them for a long time. When I saw him in the distance he was either in jeans and a T-shirt or overalls and a baseball cap, and wire frames. On Sunday morning however he appeared during breakfast and made a cheerful comment. The time he was dressed up and the glasses were semi-rimless, gunmetal-coloured wire. Sunday best specs!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jamie32</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2011, 12:15</p><p>Went to the local market today. Nice collection of guys in late teens and twenties wearing spectacles. A lot of them going for black plastic frames that look amazing on them. And some nice semi-rimless selections as well. Always makes shopping more interesting when guys wearing cute glasses</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2011, 20:53</p><p>Nice sighting in a supermarket (LIDL) the other day. I had caught sight of this cute guy in glasses once or twice on the way round, but he was in front of me at the checkout and I was able to enjoy the view. Nice slim figure, jeans and T-shirt, pale complexion, short black hair and designer stubble. Moderately bold black plastic frames, low minus lenses - couldn't have chosen better!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian</b>&nbsp;24 Jul 2011, 14:09</p><p>Julian, it's definitely true - I wear stronger glasses than my dad</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 Jul 2011, 07:27</p><p>I got new glasses a few weeks ago, not that my Rx had changed, but I had some credit with a health insurance group and fancied a change. For the last few years I've been wearing semi-rimless, so I went to an online supplier and got a bold plastic frame, tortoiseshell colour. The progressive lenses are quite good, but definitely not up to the standard of the Rodenstock lenses in my other pair. The interesting thing is that hardly anyone has commented on my new image - one guy did after I admired his new glasses...never seen him in them till recently. After Mass on Sunday, however, a guy who comes to our church when he's staying with his parents commented and positively admired them, remarking that they were similar to his. He's a low myope, with a wife and two delightful young sons who've both been wearing glasses for a year or two, but this time were in wire frames instead of dark plastic...apparently the younger kid breaks his fairly often. What struck me was that the older kid, aged ten to twelve I guess, was wearing stronger lenses than his father - signs of power rings which to me suggests an Rx of -3 or 4 at least. My guess is that the kid is well on the way to coke bottles, maybe his brother too, who knows. </p><p>My question: assuming that myopia is hereditary,is it normal for the child to be more myopic than the parent? and is there any explanation? The other week I met a father and son; father with low minus glasses, son a Ph.D.) with coke bottles, and I wondered then,</p><p></p><hr>







<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2011, 04:25</p><p>...or even black wire ovals!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2011, 04:24</p><p>Great Scott, it's ages since I posted here! Anyway I was in London last weekend and went to my favourite Italian barber's shop for a haircut. There's one very beautiful young barber there, who looks but doesn't sound Italian: nice dark hair &amp; beard, brown eyes (no glasses), trim figure, neat backside; but when my turn came I was cut by an older and not specially attractive but definitely Italian-sounding guy who in my experience has a better feel for the way my hair grows. When the young guy finished work on his customer he picked up a pair of glasses and either handed them to him or perhaps even put them right on his face - so of course I was all attention! The glasses were back wire ovals, minus Rx, not strong; and the wearer was tall and slim, with black hair cut short and another lovely figure including another neat backside. A real bonus!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Apr 2011, 20:07</p><p>In a shopping mall the other day I was interested to see a young guy stop and put on a pair of gold-rimmed glasses with plue lenses to look at his iPhone - or Blackberry - or similar. Never actually seen anyone do that, but it illustrates what various eyesceners have mentioned.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2011, 20:43</p><p>Wandering round Tesco yesterday I got several glimpses of a particularly beautiful young man who seemed to be with a few of his mates. He was tall and slim, with longish hair, golden rather than fair, and a clear complexion. His glasses were oblong-to-oval, gold or maybe brown (I did say I only got glimpses!) with a low minus Rx. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2011, 09:43</p><p>Oddly enough, Tim, beer is still sold by the pint, and I even hear rumours of third-of-a-pint glasses for beer festivals. And I think the milkman still delivers a pint, but this plastic bottle from the farm shop was marked '500 ml'.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2011, 22:29</p><p>Oh dear. Has the pinta gone now? I have been out of the country too long! What has happened to the UK? I suppose that beer is now sold in half-litre mugs now, and no doubt at the same price as (or more than) the dear old pint!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2011, 14:02</p><p>Shopping at the local farm shop last Saturday, I was struck by the number of guys in smart-looking glasses. No raving beauties, you understand, but several in well-chose black wire frames, mostly with minus lenses, one of them pretty strong. The most interesting guy in the place was behind the meat counter (where all the meat is labelled with the name of the farm where it was reared). He was solidly built (not fat) medium height, with a very smart pair of glasses: black frames, fairly thin at the bottom, wide temples, rimless at the outer edges (is there a name for that style?) Minus lenses, not very strong. I just thought what excellent taste he had. </p><p>Wednesday I called in there again, just to get a pint or rather 500ml. of milk, and he was behind the meat counter again, but without glasses. </p><p>Why, I ask myself, and anyone else who has an idea, does a good-looking guy who has chosen a pair of specs that enhance his appearance fool around with contact lenses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2011, 05:16</p><p>At the beginning of the month I went shopping for calendars when the price was reduced - you know, the way people do. I looked through a selection of film star &amp; celebrity calendars: David Tennant...Cliff Richard...the Jonas brothers...Justin Timberlake...not a pair of glasses to be seen until I got to Johnny Depp. Need I say more?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Jan 2011, 05:09</p><p>I changed my car recently - and almost immediately managed to get a scratch on the paintwork! I had to call at the suppliers yesterday about something else, and took the opportunity of ordering a 'touch-up pen'. The young man who dealt with this was tall with curly hair and glasses, not a raving beauty but not wholly unattractive either. His glasses were quite shiny and new-looking, with brown plastic frames and lenses around -4. The item wasn't in stock and I had to call back this morning for it, and when he emerged from the office I could have sworn he gave a slight squint. With new glasses? Surely not! Is he just having a break from contacts because of an infection? Or, perish the thought, pending lasik? Or does he have galloping myopia? Or is he just very good at keeping his specs clean? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2010, 08:53</p><p>At lunch time yesterday in a pub in a village near here, I was interested to see a guy (40s? 50s?) in nondescript clothes and extremely strong minus glasses - minus 12? minus 15? maybe even more. The frames were basic round wire, old-fashioned NHS style, nothing flattering abut them. I thought, what a wasted opportunity. I suppose he might just have been having a day's rest from contacts, but even so.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2010, 14:00</p><p>Where do people find such fantastic frames as Julian describes - that suit them perfectly, and definately raise a smile ;) </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Nov 2010, 04:47</p><p>On a London bus on Thursday evening a good-looking Asian guy took the seat in front of me, wearing the most beautiful glasses: rimless, and the temples were transparent with a core of black wire. Not too sure about the Rx, but there was significant cylinder there. </p><p>On the train home on Friday, two young guys (students?) got on at Cambridge and then off at Ely (where a lot of connecting services pass through). One of them was distinctly scruffy: jeans and a donkey jacket, untidy shoulder-length hair and a generally unscrubbed appearance, though I suppose he can't help his complexion. He was wearing round black wire frames with a substantial minus Rx, -6 or 7 I guess.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 Sep 2010, 09:14</p><p>As I was shopping in Tesco the other day, my eye was caught by a striking pair of glasses. On inspection they turned out to be quite incongruous with the shabby clothes and general appearance of the youth who was wearing them. The frames were bright red, maybe even scarlet, quite heavy plastic with wide temples and two rows of tiny rhinestones along each temple. The lenses were minus, around -2, -3 at the most - so he did need them. Couldn't help thinking a Harry Potterish frame would have been more appropriate.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2010, 04:49</p><p>Later on on my drive home I stopped at a filling station-cum-café for a pee and a cup of coffee. The cashier who served me was a cute, well-spoken young guy with a bright smile, dark hair and big black plastic frames, the sort that used to be retro but is now the in thing. The lenses were not high minus but not to be sneezed at either. My guess is that he might be a student working there for the summer. Anyway, he was a pretty sight as I sipped my coffee.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Aug 2010, 04:43</p><p>Ships that pass in the night... </p><p>I've had a few days' break in London; on my way home yesterday I was driving up Finchley Road in the Temple Fortune district and saw a good-looking young guy going into an optician's shop. I enjoyed speculating about why. Was he going to come out wearing his first glasses? Or was he apprehensive about the test he was about to have, wondering, or perhaps knowing, that he might have to get glasses? Or did he just want cleaning stuff for his contacts? Or of course the other possibility is that he worked there and was returning to work after his lunch break!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2010, 11:22</p><p>Here we are again! In a shopping mall this morning I saw a big butch guy, not so much designer stubble as unshaven for a few days, clothes nothing special, with his wife (or partner anyway) and he was pushing a buggy with a little kid in it. But he was wearing the CAMPEST glasses I've ever seen! the fronts were fairly ordinary black (plastic? metal? I don't know) but the temples were wide, in PALE PINK plastic! As far as I could see the lenses were low plus with a bit of cylinder. Talk about incongruous!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>myopeinhere</b>&nbsp;02 Aug 2010, 03:10</p><p>Lol,good to have you back Julian</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;02 Aug 2010, 02:55</p><p>Good grief, it's nearly two months since I jotted! Anyway, I wanted to mention two handsome young guys I was chatting to the other day: both tall and slim, both fairly dark, both short-sighted. James had short black hair and designer stubble; his glasses were rather narrow (top-to-bottom) rectangles in black plastic, but the black was only on the surface, they were clear behind that. Paul was REALLY cute, with curly brown hair and short beard. His frames were brown plastic, in the fashionable style where the outside edges are rimless (does that style have a name?) and as we were talking he looked straight at me and I realized that the eyes behind his fairly strong minus lenses (-5 or so) were bright blue. I really came over all unnecessary ::)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2010, 00:27</p><p>No, I don't think much of them - too much like the NHS frames I had when I was 18. Either something in wire or a heavier plastic frame, maybe oblong, would be better IMHO.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Presby L</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2010, 08:45</p><p>Julian, What do you think of Anderson Cooper and his new glasses? Quite cure I's say</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2010, 09:04</p><p>Shopping last night (with a female friend) in the nearest branch of LIDL, I was interested to notice one of the big butch guys who work there was wearing glasses with heavy black frames as he moved goods around. When we finished, he was on the only till that was operating - LIDL seems to keep prices down by employing the minimum staff! I was able to have a good look and discovered that his frames weren't black at all, but a very dark green, and the lenses were plus. I noticed that he looked over them to talk to another of the staff who was some way away, but on the other hand he seemed to be wearing them full time around the store. A new wearer, I guess - and if I'd been alone I'd certainly have told him how much I liked them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 May 2010, 02:29</p><p>Doing a bit of emergency shopping on Bank Holiday Monday, as I drove into Tesco car park I noticed four or five young guys hanging out there. One of them, tallish with a slim figure, was just turning away as I passed but I got a glimpse of curly fair hair, a peaches and cream complexion, and glasses, possibly with gold wire frames. I've been enjoying the memory ever since, but it was no more than a glimpse. Maybe if I'd got closer he'd have turned out to have acne, bad teeth, halitosis and non-prescription shades. Never mind, the edited memory looks good!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2010, 03:04</p><p>Watched the first leg of the finals of 'Masterchef' on the Good Food channel last night. The three finalists, all guys, were shipped to India and set to cook three meals using Indian cuisine - and all three did really well. The most interesting of them from my point of view was a guy in his twenties called Alex: tall and slim, with curly fair hair and fair beard, blue eyes, ready smile. Best of all, in an early morning scene he was WEARING GLASSES - fairly heavy black plastic frames, lenses maybe -2, -3 at the most. A bit later the glasses had gone; I guess he must have put in contact lenses, because he didn't seem to squint at all. One of the other contestants, Tim, wore glasses full time, also with minus lenses, but heavyish black semi-rimless, and seemed to have to push them up fairly often. Anyway, Alex is definitely my favourite!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2010, 18:05</p><p>Interesting one today: I was having lunch very close to the bar hatch in a favourite old-fashioned pub a few miles from home when a tall (very tall) dark (black hair and five o'clock shadow at one o'clock) and handsome (yes, not bad at all) guy came up to order for himself, his wife and small daughter. The pub doesn't take credit or debit cards, so he had to dash off to the nearest town to get cash from an ATM. But I digress. He was dressed in jeans and sweater with a casual jacket, had well-kept hands with long fingers, and was wearing the most unlikely glasses, as retro as anything I've seen in a month of Sundays. Minus lenses in perfectly circular gold wire frames, low joint and low nose piece too, cable temples. They were a bit incongruous, I thought, with the rest of his image. Does he wear them all the time, I wonder - or had he put on a spare pair for a change - or was it his day for taking a break from contacts? But above all, where the hell did he get specs like those in this day and age? </p><p>By contrast, I had a trip to London last Wednesday, and the most striking guys on the train, and tube, and bus, and at my meeting, were all in heavy black plastic frames, One with red flashes on the temples.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2010, 03:50</p><p>Out to dinner last night, same restaurant as before. Same waiter as before, dressed as before in black from head to toe, or at least neck to ankle - but NO GLASSES!!  He wasn't squinting either, and I wondered whether he'd gone in for contact lenses or something worse 8((( but when we got up to leave I noticed a pair of glasses on the till, probably  the ones he was wearing last time. So he might have been experimenting with contacts, but keeping his glasses handy. Or maybe his myopia is so slight that he can cope bareyed in a large room (but he seemed to be full time before, and they were his second pair at least.) </p><p>The place was very quiet - two other people who left soon after we arrived - and the waiter (called Vincent) was very friendly and chatty; his sister is married to the chef/manager. If I'd been on my own I might have passed a remark about the absence of glasses, but not in company. </p><p>The meal, by the way, was superb - pheasant breast in a rich sauce with roast vegetables.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2010, 07:47</p><p>I've been watching the Good Food Channel this week: Gary Rhodes in 'Rhodes across Italy'. He's discovering the cuisine of different regions of Italy, accompanied by two sous-chefs, who both have Italian surnames but look and sound impeccably English. One is a blonde girl; the other a spexy youth, not precisely pretty but, you know. Tall, slim, unshaven, with untidy curly brown hair and an engaging smile. His glasses have big, heavy black plastic frames with a designer's mark on them (might be Pierre Cardin) and r-e-a-l s-t-r-o-n-g plus lenses. I haven't seen him so much as push them up, but he has to be pretty blind without them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2009, 09:04</p><p>Out to dinner the other evening at the (really good) local restaurant. The waiter, about six foot three and thin, fair hair, black pants, black shirt, black apron, has got new black-framed glasses. He had black framed glasses before, but these are wider with wide temples and for the moment look a bit obtrusive on his face, but I expect they'll look quite normal before long. The lenses are low minus, and he doesn't take them off (see my previous post!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2009, 08:58</p><p>I hear all everybody has said on this thread (even if I've kept quiet for a month).

When people are prescribed their first glasses maybe they're told they need them for driving and they can usually get by without them for the rest of the time. That's probably the case till people get to around -2, so they're probably taking them off because they were told to wear them for distance and because they don't really make a difference up close. Unless they consider them part of their wardrobe of course.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>minus 5 who luvs gwgs</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2009, 00:52</p><p>I too know a 20 something girl low myope about -2 who when talking to you always has her glasses on her forehead and uses them only for distance she just does not need them for distances of less than 5 feet or so</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>OttO</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2009, 10:20</p><p>Julian: </p><p>Assuming very low sphere &amp; no astigmatism, it could simply be more comfortable on the eyes to go bare-eyed for near tasks such as eating and reading or even playing cards.  Frames just might be a nuisance for someone new to wearing glasses. A very low myope also should have no trouble seeing across the table without specs.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dan</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2009, 08:41</p><p>Julian, </p><p> </p><p>I also know of 2 people who are probably around -1 who take their glasses off when they eat (both girls).  They are both ~20.  I know one of them just prefers not to eat with them on...that's what she told me at least.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2009, 07:28</p><p>Hi Julian, I know two -2s early 30s who take their glasses off to eat.  Both girls, one always hangs her glasses on one of the buttons on her blouse.  Difficult to concentrate really!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2009, 23:39</p><p>Another sighting, only mildly interesting. Last Saturday I went with a friend to an 'Autumn Fair' in aid of the local Roman Catholic church (and spent too much money at the second-hand bookstall!) In the crowd I noticed a tall, dark youth with glasses - minus lenses in brown plastic frames. He was nothing special to look at, just the best-looking, actually the only young guy there. At lunch time (home-made soup, filled rolls, cake, coffee) he and his mother came to share our table and we got into conversation - they had come down from Scotland to clear his grandmother's house as she had died recently, and the fair was an opportunity of getting some food. I noticed with interest that when he sat down to eat he pushed his glasses up into his hair and ate bareyed (brown eyes). When they got up to go he put them back where they belonged, in front of his eyes. </p><p>Why, I wonder, does a low myope do this? Is he a new wearer who hasn't trained his ciliary muscles to accommodate? Or is it early presbyopia? Any ideas, anyone?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2009, 06:36</p><p>Before anyone starts insinuating, I don't make a habit of looking at kids either; but an unusually strong pair of glasses will catch my eye, even if it's a kid wearing them - and I can see this lad being a candidate for myodisks by the time he's 20, even though his dad's specs were just pretty strong.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>minus 5 who luvs gwgs</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2009, 22:38</p><p>I do not make a habit of looking at kids but once saw a girl of about 10 with very strong glasses they were I guess about minus 12 she would now be about 30 I wonder what she has progressed to??</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2009, 18:20</p><p>Shopping in ASDA this evening I was struck by the sight of a family group - father and three sons maybe, the boys all quite young. All four wore glasses with wire frames and minus lenses, all strong except the middle kid; his were pretty ordinary, but his elder brother (if I got them right) was s-e-r-i-o-u-s-l-y myopic, like -10 or even more, and no older than mid-teens.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Nov 2009, 08:11</p><p>I've been meaning for a fortnight to post about the guy I saw waiting in line to check in at Tel Aviv airport. I don't know what race he was, but he was very pretty, with strong minus lenses in a rimless frame with bold red plastic temples and bridge and toning T-shirt. He was chatting animatedly all the time and giving a frequent dazzling smile to, I eventually realized, a beefy fair-haired guy much less attractive than he was.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Presby L</b>&nbsp;02 Nov 2009, 21:51</p><p>Julian, Every overseas flight is filled with Flight Attendants who are glasses wearers.......usually presbyopes or latent hyperopes becauss seniority and age.  What is interesting is now the male FA's are getting up in age as well and pulling out their reading glasses.........mmmmmmm</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Therouteur</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2009, 15:59</p><p>I think that's because they need them to read the material about their pensions. Somebody PLEASE bring back the "flight attendant as sex object" concept Where are you when we need you, Howard Hughes?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2009, 08:13</p><p>Julian, </p><p> </p><p>I've noticed that old taboo for flight attendants slowly changed here in the US in the last twenty years.  They frequently wear glasses now which often makes for great "captive" sightings during flights. In the early '70s, a girl friend of mine was reviewing an airline's application forms that made the statement "wearing of glasses was not allowed but contact lenses would be considered". I guess having contact issues would have created a "sick day" or meant working a flight uncorrected. Better for us that it has changed - for many reasons.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kevin</b>&nbsp;14 Oct 2009, 14:28</p><p>I was just wondering, do you know many people on this site that are from the UK?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kevin</b>&nbsp;13 Oct 2009, 14:42</p><p>Hi Julian, </p><p> </p><p>Do you live in the UK?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;13 Oct 2009, 08:38</p><p>Flying by El Al to Tel Aviv yesterday, I was interested to notice that three of the flight attendants were wearing glasses, which I thought was frowned on. One was a girl with exotic plastic frames and minus lenses. the others were guys, both quite cute, both semi-rimless, both minus. One low minus, silver wire. The other, cuter, called Moshe, higher minus, maybe -4, black wire. It was all very nice!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Oct 2009, 18:15</p><p>Looked the other day at a selection of celebrity calenders in a shop - you know, a different photo of the same person for each month of the year. Brad Pitt...David Tennant...Wentworth Miller...no sign of glasses on any of them. Only Johnny Depp being honest, and looking cool.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Oct 2009, 10:55</p><p>Odd sighting in Tesco this afternoon: great big tall guy, broad shouldered as well, with spiky black hair and smart fashion glasses with double temples, lenses (minus) unprotected by frames on the outer edges. Bright blue sweater, shorts revealing nice tanned hairy legs, flip-flops. The odd thing was that his toenails were varnished silver. Odder still that he was with a wife or girlfriend...unless of course she was his sister.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2009, 02:13</p><p>Pleasant time shopping in ASDA last night. It's my favourite supermarket for most things, besides being the cheapest ("part of the Wal-Mart family"). It's just a pity the nearest one is 25 miles away. Anyway, even though the temperature is dropping there were lots of young men in shorts; and you may remember a nice pair of calves pleases me almost as much as a nice pair of specs! The star sighting of the evening was a tall slim lad of, I guess, 17 or 18 in jeans rather than shorts. White T-shirt that revealed shapely arms. Fair hair, clear complexion. A really well-chosen pair of specs, semi-rimless, wide-ish temples in blue and silver. But the power rings! And the cut-in! I reckon -8 at least. he'd have been pretty blind without them, but seemed to see just fine with them</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2009, 07:54</p><p>My gardener/odd job man has lost his glasses, and says he's struggling without them (he lost them once before, and they turned up in my garden shed!) They had gunmetal frames, squared-off oval, and the lenses were plus, stronger than mine I'd say, with cylinder. The odd thing was that he'd come up the street wearing them, and take them off, or more often push them up into his hair, when he had to look at anything, even close up. When I commented on this he said it was because of the tint in the lenses (which was quite dark). Just can't understand a guy who's hyperopic taking his specs off to read (he's only 37 and not too bad-looking). I think he's got a new pair on order, so we shall see what happens when he gets them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 Sep 2009, 07:16</p><p>OK, here goes! Had an appointment at the Health Centre the other day, and as I walked from the car park to the entrance I noticed a tall guy ahead of me with short hair, and I could see he was wearing glasses. When we got inside I joined the line for reception, and he for the dispensary, and I managed to get just a glance at him. He was fairly tanned, and unshaven - or maybe I should call it designer stubble ::) Anyway, his glasses had dark brown wire frames, quite plain, rounded-off oblongs. Lenses around -3. The specs fitted him well, and looked superb. Just goes to show it doesn't take fancy frames to look good. Wouldn't have minded more than a glance!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2009, 11:25</p><p>Julian - come back more often!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2009, 02:43</p><p>Hi Julian, they tell me that losing the urge is a sign of age creeping up. :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2009, 00:17</p><p>Julian's jottings are few and far between these days; be assured I still see plenty of cute guys with glasses, but don't seem to feel such an urge to jot about them - or maybe to find the time. However, two sightings in London yesterday... </p><p>On my way to a meeting near Oxford Circus, I got off the bus, and as I walked up Regent Street, a handsome young man with untidy fair hair was holding a pair of white wire framed glasses up to his eyes to look at something in the distance. Having seen whatever it was, he hooked them to the neck of his black T-shirt. </p><p>Later, as I was waiting in Oxford Street for a bus to Kings Cross, a slightly built youth in a red and black checked shirt came along, and several time over gave a great squint whenever he wanted to see something more than about six feet away. Hm, I thought, don't you have your glasses with you - or don't you like wearing them - or have you not realized you need them?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2009, 09:39</p><p>Isnât it nice when a good-looking young man turns out to wear glasses?  </p><p>The other day I stopped at a motorway service station in Scotland for a cold drink and a nibble. When I returned to the car park I noticed a young man talking on a mobile phone close to the yellow Renault hatchback that was next to my car. He was tall with dark hair, and not unpleasant to look at, but I didnât pay too much attention. When I got into my own car I studied the map for a few minutes and then got ready to move off. When I looked around I saw that the youth was at the wheel of his car with one lady next to him and another in the seat behindâand he had put his glasses on to drive! They were, as far as I could see, dark wire frames, octagonal in shape, not my favourite style, but they suited him. The lenses were minus, not strong but certainly not negligible. I enjoyed the view for a minute or two before starting the engine and going on my way. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2008, 11:56</p><p>Roll on tomorrow, I said. Yesterday morning I had a phone call to say the optometrist was off sick - and the next appointment they had that I can manage is in another three weeks. So I have to struggle a bit longer ...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Nov 2008, 12:35</p><p>Blimey, It's along time since I posted here! Eye test tomorrow; it's been booked for a few weeks, and a few days after I booked it I managed to break my current glasses which are just over a year old. The left temple has snapped off, and would have to be replaced; and it seemed sensible to wait for this test before deciding whether to spend the money. So I've been using my previous pair, two years old, for the last three weeks or so; but they have about 0.50 less (plus) for distance and 0.50 less add. On top of that they're quite a bit deeper (from top to bottom) than the newer ones and I have to look a long way down to get the maximum correction...they are progressives. For some purposes, and in good light, I'm OK; but at other times I'm struggling to read. Roll on tomorrow - and roll on wearing the right Rx again!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julie-Anne</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2008, 13:48</p><p>Stopped off at a service station to stock up on petrol and cranberry muffins, and my eye was immediately caught by the man behind the till. Nice manners, though nothing to look at, wearing one of those grey overalls  none too clean! - with his hair pulled back and knotted in a sort of pigtail. And I do mean hair  he had only one, grey and frizzled, not my sort of thing at all, and I did find his lack of teeth a bit off-putting, though I suppose, come to think of it, he must have been a good ten years older than me, well into his 70s. But his specs! Plastic readers, a bit bent out of shape, half moon, about +3 by the looks of them, broken at the temples but cunningly held together with Elastoplast... well, they suited him a treat and quite made my day. In fact, I nearly came over all unnecessary on my way back to the car!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;01 Sep 2008, 02:33</p><p>At lunch yesterday in a favourite pub in a village a few miles away, I was diverted by the sight of lots of nice young men in shorts or three-quarter pants - it was a baking hot day, and there was a thunderstorm in the evening - and you may remember that my estimation a nice pair of legs comes second only to a nice pair of specs on a guy. The pick of the bunch was a guy of about 20 I suppose: black shorts, striped polo shirt, green, yellow and black, and the open neck showed a chest as brown as his legs short dark hair, and, yes, glasses: oblong dark wire frames, fairly standard but perfect on him, lenses I guessed -3.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;01 Sep 2008, 02:21</p><p>Shopping in Tesco on Saturday, not the local branch but a bigger one about 15 miles away, I needed help in choosing batteries of a size I don't usually buy. I looked for the nearest member of staff, who just happened (I assure you!) to be a boy with glasses. He turned out not to know much about batteries, but struggled to find the information I needed while I enjoyed the view: he was tall and thin with black hair, wearing the uniform black pants and blue checked shirt. His glasses? Fashion frames, with wide tapering temples, divided along their length between black and transparent; strong plus lenses. In the end I chose the batteries for myself, and they were the right ones.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2008, 08:20</p><p>On the way home from Scotland I stopped for an early lunch at the best (not to say the only decent) service station on the motorway network, at Tebay in Westmorland. At the next table, three young guys, two of whom might well be brothers: both had fair complexions and longish fair hair, similar facial structure and minus glasses, the elder with dark wire frames and the younger blue wire. At another table nearby and older but good-looking guy with his wife/girlfriend. he was tall and thin, wearing a baseball cap which didn't conceal that he was overdue for a haircut. Gold wire frames, power rings and cut-in, possibly even plano fronts. The soup was good too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2008, 08:18</p><p>On holiday in Scotland, I seem to have had a season of spexy barmen. First, in a pub in Dundee where I went a couple of lunch times, the best of the bunch: moderately tall, black short-sleeved shirt, black pants, black hair cut short, heavy five o'clock shadow already at lunch time (or else he hadn't got round to shaving), high colour, ready smile and (apparently) boundless energy. I suspected he might be the landlord, though he was quite young. Not-to-be-despised minus lenses in black plastic frames, no very distinctive shape, just right for him. Then, in a rather grand hotel in the Highlands with an amazing selection of malt whiskies, a barman, less sexy but not unattractive, tallish with medium brown hair and a very smart pair of specs: frames semi-rimless in a reddish plastic, this year's style, Rx modest minus. He was very knowledgeable about his extensive stock of malt whiskies! Finally (at least as far as barmen are concerned) in another pub close to Loch Ness, a barman I might not have jotted about if it hadn't been that he added to the series: tall, slim, untidy dark hair and fairly standard dark wire frames, minus lenses again, not strong; a pleasant  enough sight. </p><p>At the farmhouse where I had a few nights' bed and breakfast, the younger son of the family was a real beanpole with an engaging smile and plus lenses in wire frames - I wasn't quite sure if he was wearing the same pair every time I saw him. Over the few days I came to the conclusion the lenses were stronger than I'd thought at first. </p><p>A postscript, about a guy who was sexy but not spexy. At a Starbucks in Inverness I noticed him sitting at the next table, all in black, with startling blond hair maybe a suicide blond, (dyed by his own hand) or maybe not; his complexion was fair. He was chatting to another guy, with much moveemnt of thbe hands and eyes. "Hmm," I thought; "if you're not I'm not." The next time I looked up he'd gone; then a minute or two later I realized he was now wearing a green apron and waiting on customers.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2008, 00:38</p><p>Went out to dinner last night. Young couple at the next table: the girl was supremely unmemorable - but I would say that, wouldn't I? The guy was tallish, tanned, with black hair and brown eyes, and classic rimless glasses with a modest minus Rx. He wore shorts that revealed magnificent calves, hairy and muscular, shoes that (alas) concealed his feet, and a short-sleeved, open-necked shirt that revealed hairy arms but, as far as I could see, a smooth chest. Lucky girl!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2008, 02:10</p><p>As you know, I usually post only about guys in glasses - but what the hell, this is EYE Scene. Tesco again. I nipped in yesterday to get three items, and within five minutes, without trying (I assure you) passed this young guy THREE TIMES. Tall, thin, wearing three-quarter pants. Shock of black hair, but BRIGHT BLUE eyes. Yes, I know, a pair of black wire frames with minus lenses would just have completed the picture, but even so he was gorgeous. Anyway, nobody's eyesight improves with age; he could be in specs tomorrow, or in a few weeks, months, or years. Just hope I see him when he is!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2008, 03:15</p><p>I've been to Tesco again. This time it was the guy on one of the checkouts who caught my attention. I have noticed him before but this time he was looking particularly good. He's tall, about 6'2", medium build. He was wearing a bright red T-shirt advertising Tesco's special offers, and that revealed a bit more of him than the checked shirts most of the staff wear. He has dark ginger hair, cut short, and brown wire ovals, around -2. Nothing fancy about his glasses, but they are just right for him and without them he just wouldn't be the same!</p><p></p><hr>

Glasses with dark blue wire frames and lenses around -6 or 7.

Recently the mail has been delivered by a younger fair-haired guy in shorts, whose legs are definitely not the worst I've seen. This morning, however, it was a tall slim guy in a red polo shirt and black pants, unshaven, with black hair and black wire-framed glasses, maybe -3, -4. Nice.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2008, 05:01</p><p>Shopping in Tesco the other day, I came face to face with a boy of school age, 14 or 15 at the most - and before anyone starts on me, the ONLY thing I noticed about him was the strength and thickness of the minus lenses in his glasses; I haven't even a clue what his frames were like. I thought, "Blimey, that kid's short sighted for his age' - and then saw the man right behind him: no oil painting, but wearing real coke bottles in rather unexciting gold frames. Conclusion: the kid has inherited the myopia gene from his dad, and is on a spiral of increase through the rest of his teens, and maybe longer.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;22 May 2008, 12:05</p><p>Last Sunday I'd been out in the afternoon and was on the way to church for an early evening service. As I drove towards the church I passed a young couple: she had a lovely head of long reddish-gold hair; he was very tall, with short, nicely cut fair hair. He was wearing shorts and brown shoes without socks, revealing a lovely pair of thin but muscular calves, tanned and a bit hairy. He was wearing black-framed shades. By the time I got parked and into church I was a minute or so late so I slipped into a back seat, and when I looked around I saw the same couple a row or two in front, description as before except that now he was wearing oval rimless glasses with, at a rough guess, -3. Talk about improving on perfection! The curious thing was that when the service was over and they got up to go, he'd taken his specs off and was navigating bareyed. Even if -3 was an overestimate, I'd have thought he was myopic enough to make full time wear sensible if not essential - but if not, why put them on to read from a book? Unless of course he was enjoying the appearance of the church.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 May 2008, 12:00</p><p>Five or six years ago I posted a few times about my then assistant, who was in his early 40s, gay, not bad looking, and getting more dependent on glasses for reading. I'd checked his reading glasses out one day when he wasn't around and discovered one lens had more plus than the other, which had a bit of cylinder. Since then we've both moved to different parts of the country and don't meet very often; but I've seen him a couple of times since Easter and he's now full time in glasses - progressives I think - with a smart frame with wide black and silver temples. Pretty much what I was expecting, and predicting, back then.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 May 2008, 00:12</p><p>Met the most delicious youth the other evening at a meeting at church - a university student aged about 18 or 19, so no problems about looking admiringly. Slim, with black hair and fresh complexion; dressed conservatively but with excellent taste: slacks, shirt and tie all toning, in a colour that I think is called aubergine, a kind of dark purple. Eyes dark blue, slightly boss-eyed; glasses black wire ovals with (I thought) a very low minus Rx. Quite surprisingly he wore them all the time; but of course there may have been an element of cylinder or prism there as well as the minus sphere. Why, I ask myself, was he there? he was the youngest person there by 20 if not 30 years. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting to him.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2008, 17:25</p><p>To London again yesterday; no sightings to match the last ones I reported, but one curiosity on the way home... </p><p>A big guy got on the train at Cambridge. He was wearing a brown anorak, and sat down with an air of 'I won't take my coat off, I'm not stopping' and as he got off again at Ely I suppose that was reasonable. He had dark hair flecked with grey, and beard similar, and he was wearing black wire-framed glasses with plus lenses. Soon after he sat down I saw him push his glasses down his nose a bit so that he could look over them, which he continued to do as long as he stayed on the train. He didn't attempt to read a book or a paper. So why the heck didn't he just take his specs off?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2008, 09:48</p><p>Went to London yesterday and had a wonderful journey back today. First, a vision of loveliness at Kings Cross: a tall thin youth wearing cycling gear and pushing his bike around. Tall? I guess six foot four or five. The close-fitting top and shorts showed his figure off to the best advantage, and he had black gloves and (I think) separate sleeves that went up almost to his elbows. His glasses had wire frames and the lenses had to be -10 or even -12. He stood around for quite a while, probably waiting for his train to be signalled, and I was able to enjoy the view unobserved. </p><p>Then, when I got on my train, I found myself surrounded by spexy guys. On my left a guy with a sallow complexion and close-cropped black hair who hadn't shaved (well, it's Saturday!) and semi-rimless specs in black wire - really nothing to write home about. Facing me a tall guy with medium-coloured hair and light blue eyes, wearing a grey suit with a chalk stripe, open-necked white shirt and short black overcoat. Rx -5 or 6 I guess, black plastic frames with a grey flash on the wide temples. Come to think of it, I don't think he'd shaved either, but it was less obvious with his hair colour. He spent the whole journey either asleep or listening to his iPod with his eyes closed, so once again I was able to have a good look. At one point the train gave a jolt and my coat fell off the rack and landed on his lap; he opened his eyes and gave me a pleasant smile. Finally, on my right, across the gangway, a young guy in torn jeans, fleece and trainers; black wire frames again - straight temples that didn't bend over hie ears (I like that look and find it comfortable in my own specs) and a moderate minus Rx, no more than -3. He had just a touch of colour in his cheeks that added to the interest. </p><p>All three of these guys got off at Cambridge, as a lot of passengers always do, leaving my to read my MacFormat magazine (MAY issue came in the post yesterday!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2008, 18:58</p><p>My TV set died over Easter, so I've had to spend out on a new one. Went to the local shop this afternoon and was served by a cute youth whose name tag said 'Aaron': tall and thin, untidy (spiky?) hair, ready smile, pleasant manner, good sales technique (he got me to spend several hundred pounds!) Would I mention a guy here if he didn't wear glasses? Dark wire oblong frames, decorated temples that looked quite good though not this year's fashion, minus lenses - not strong but not negligible either.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;22 Mar 2008, 09:41</p><p>Another spec-tacular sighting this afternoon, when I was shopping in Tesco for a few 'emergency' items before Easter. Tall, good looking youth with dark hair cut short (recently cut too), fresh complexion, jeans and donkey jacket (the weather is horrible). His glasses had white metal fronts and dark plastic temples. Lenses strongish plus, with quite a lot of cylinder. He had a girl with him, but I suppose you can't have everything!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2008, 19:00</p><p>Shopping in ASDA the other evening, there was a good selection of sexy spexy guys. One of the staff of the CD/DVD department is a tall thin boy with black hair and glasses with modern frames, wide temples black mottled with grey, plus lenses...I often get a sighting of him and it's always nice. Another dark-haired guy, a customer this time, had minus lenses and fashion frames, wide black temples with a narrow strip of silvery metal. The star sighting, however, was a guy wearing strong minus glassess, maybe around -6, -8, semi-rimless in red wire, jeans, a fawn jacket tailored to show his delicious slim figure to the best advantage, and red suede trainers - the match of the trainers with the specs was specially striking.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ted</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2008, 09:08</p><p>Julian, glad to "see" everything is well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Mar 2008, 08:46</p><p>Hi Ted, I'm here OK, and have posted occasionally on other threads, but haven't had all that much to jot about lately. Also I've been kind of busy after moving house (I was in temporary accommodation for a whole year) so haven't been so much in 'spot it and jot it' mode. However... </p><p>In all the work that was done on the 'new' house, they took out the chimney and got rid of the old TV aerial. I had some trouble getting someone to fit a new one, and when an engineer came he said he couldn't get a decent digital signal - and as the analogue signal is being switched off in three or four years they don't fit analogue aerials any more. He was a big guy with close-cropped black hair, a heavy five o'clock shadow (though out was only two o'clock) a sallow complexion, and strong minus glasses with, almost inevitably, black wire frames. His advice was to get a satellite dish instead, and it was yesterday that another guy came to install that. He was shorter, slimmer, and bronzed rather than sallow, and wore a very bright wedding ring. He too wore glasses with black frames (might have been carbon fibre I guess, had some decoration) but his lenses were plus - not high plus but not negligible, and tinted. he was a pleasant enough sight!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2007, 02:41</p><p>Shopping (for kitchen furniture) at B&amp;Q; the other day, I couldn't help noticing a decent number of sexy spexy guys working there. While I ws being served, I was much distracted by a tall, well-built guy with a shock of dark curly hair and black wire rims with a substantial minus Rx, -5? -6? On the way out of the warehouse I looked again: was it just his glasses? No, I decided; although he was quite big he had a really neat figure. Also loving arund the place was a slighter guy with fair hair and complexion and semi-rimless specs, low minus. </p><p>At lunch in a village pub yesterday, as the party at the next table got up to leave, I noticed a guy with dark hair, rosy cheeks and classic rimless glasses. Couldn't get a proper look, but had a notion they had plano fronts. Thought he headed for the gents' and watched out for him coming back, but he never did. Must have been making for the exit after all. I guess that comes under the heading of a non-sighting or maybe a nearsighting ::)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Dec 2007, 17:04</p><p>Saw the Kleen-e-ze rep. when he called today - cute guy, tall and slim with fair hair and sort of golden eyes; pleasant too. For the first time I met his lady colleague, who turns out to be, not his wife as I'd supposed since she has the same surname, but his MOTHER! This opens up all sorts of possibilities... While we were talking he picked up a form, looked at it, and then moved it a bit further from his eyes. I thought and could have said (but didn't): "Either you're older than you look, ducky, or you're pretty hyperopic and not just pretty." I suspect the latter, but I'll watch out for a pair of readers before the year is out (next year I mean).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2007, 06:48</p><p>Two somewhat short sighted guys in the pub last night - don't think I've seen either of them before. One I labelled fair, fat and, well not forty. Bald? Just close cropped? Not sure. High forehead and domed cranium, oblong frames, fairly heavy, in brown plastic, low minus lenses, prominent teeth, Irish accent. The other was rather more to my taste though quieter: black hair, sallow skin, black wire frames with a bit more Rx in them though not high.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2007, 11:40</p><p>Cute young postmen delivering letters, or maybe packets, down the street the other day: medium height, slim, sallow complexion, dark hair, medium length, and black-framed glasses, wire I thought, low minus as far as I could make out. Unfortunately he didn't come very close as I was getting my car out.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2007, 02:28</p><p>In another supermarket the other day, the checkout was manned by a large youth with dark curly hair and a high colour. Fashionable black plastic frames, with double temples and no frame on the outside edge of the lenses - and as the lenses were strong minus (at a vague guess -8) the picture was complete.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2007, 02:01</p><p>Shopping in Tesco the other lunchtime, I several times passed a tall lean guy, pale complexion, sculptured cheekbones, fairly short hair. Semi-rimless glasses, dark wire, decent minus Rx (-5? -6?) with just enough of a grey tint in the lenses to add an air of mystery. Wouldn't it be nice to look like that?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2007, 16:06</p><p>I thought everybody knew I'm as straight as a corkscrew ::)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2007, 13:24</p><p>Julian:  I am starting to think that you may be gay.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2007, 08:57</p><p>To the foot clinic this afternoon - a second visit; ten days ago I was seen by a pleasant girl who gave me a general sort-out, dealt with a nail that was ingrowing, told me to get some antibiotics prescribed, and gave me another appointment for this afternoon in case I needed it. I decided I did, and went, to find that the chiropodist on duty today was a nice young man; not a great beauty you understand, but nice and very capable. Thin, pale and cadaverous-looking, with close-cropped black hair and an equally close-cropped black beard. Would I be taking the trouble to post here if he hadn't worn glasses? Oblong black wire frames with a strong plus Rx. The other feature to mention was a particularly pleasant smile, which went with his reassuring chairside manner to offset the discomfort he put me through...I'm a real baby when it comes to having my toes hacked about; I'm much more at ease in the dentist's chair! I'll definitely try to make sure future appointments are with him</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2007, 08:05</p><p>Been to London again; two interesting sights on the same tube train...one guy in blue jeans, blue fleece, blue woolly cap, with a rugged kind of face, slightly sallow complexion; oval red plastic frames with plano fronted lenses, very strong minus. Standing about three feet from him, but with someone else, a slim young guy in brown, dark curly hair, gold frames and extremely strong plus lenses. Nice.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Nov 2007, 01:17</p><p>In the pub the other evening, a group of guys I didn't know, all wearing glasses. One short guy, high colour, dark hair and  goatee beard, wore round rimless specs with a moderate minus Rx; Tall guy, bald, goatee again, low minus (I think) in fashion frames. Most striking of all, a young guy of medium height with a mass of curly brown hair, strong minus glasses with plano fronts, and the most engaging smile, and he seemed to smile a lot. If I could have got a photo of him he'd have made a star billing on my screensaver of guys, mostly spexy!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2007, 07:32</p><p>Long time since I posted here. Again. At a conference the other day, most of the participants were middle-aged or older (like me!) but I did notice three young men, all with glasses. One was nothing to write home about: medium height medium colour of hair (but curly), palish complexion, gold frames, low to moderate minus. The second tall and slim, lonish blond hair, gold frames, moderate plus lenses, tinted. nice. The third, also very nice: also tall, broad shouldered, black hair cut short, high colour, high minus lenses in a black wire frame. Oddly enough his father was also there; I've known him slightly for about forty years; he's no oil painting and never has been, but is quite myopic. I guess the lad gets his looks from his mother and his eyesight from his father.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian (away from home)</b>&nbsp;29 Sep 2007, 00:56</p><p>Went for an eye test on Monday and of course, having moved across country, had to find a new optometrist. Opted for a 'private' practice rather than Specsavers (in spite of their wonderful 'juggler' commercial). While I was waiting for the preliminary checks a tall blonde guy came out having just had them; working clothes, wire frames, strong plus lenses. We nodded at each other and went on minding out own business. he was called in to one optomtrist and I was called a few mintes later to another. My test took its course: a bit more plus in each eye, a bit more cylinder on the right and none at all on the left, and another 0.5 of add. When I emerged to look at frames the blonde guy was trying on a fashion frame; I said, "That one looks good on you." He just grunted, but chose it. There was a special offer on Rodenstock frames and lenses, and I chose a black semi-rimless frame with plastic temples going to a lighter colour. I picked them up yesterday and am very pleased with them. The lenses are the Rodenstock equivalent of Varilux Ellipse and are taking a bit of getting used to but I did a lot of driving in them yesterday and they're fine for that. </p><p>Back to Monday. Shopping that evening in ASDA, I was looking for bitter lemon and (I kid you not) the first assistant I spotted to ask was a slim boy with dark hair and goatee beard, black wire frames and I guess -5 or maybe even -6. Pleasant and helpful too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2007, 05:28</p><p>Lunch time meeting yesterday - the sort of thing where you take your own sandwiches and the host provides soup and coffee. The host's wife was ill, and one of their sons was standing in as disher-up of soup: tall thin lad with dark curly hair cut short, pale complexion, rectangular frames in brown wire, minus lenses. No beauty, but had a certain something.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2007, 07:46</p><p>As usual on a day in London, there was plenty to see on the Tube trains. On the first rain, a cute blonde guy in shorts and white trainers, slim fitting, tanned legs, fairly hairy, red top, gold-rimmed glasses, not sure of the Rx. On the same train a tall guy, sallow or maybe coloured, carrying the jacket of his black suit, and wearing a blue shirt with red stripes. Black wire frames, kind of oblong, with plus lenses - might have been progressive though he was quite young. He gt off the train as the same station as I did, but when I headed for the other line he made for the exit. </p><p>Later in the day I got into the same carriage as three young guys speaking maybe Italian, maybe Spanish or even Portuguese. One of them wore shades with brown plastic frames and possibly a plus Rx. He wore shorts and trainers; nice hairy, muscular calves. The second also wore shorts and trainers and had quite nice legs - but no glasses. The third was in a red tracksuit, the beginnings of a Mohican hairstyle with all sorts of lines shaved at the temples, and the most HIDEOUS specs! Quite strong plus lenses, white metal frames with elaborate temples like a pattern of girders - put me in mind of the Forth Bridge! Sullen expression too. A distressing example of a spexy guy who was NOT a sexy guy!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2007, 02:05</p><p>This morning when I got up I had to collect something from the car, and went down without putting my glasses on - first time in ages that I've been out in the street bareyed, and I was amazed how blurred everything was. I'm a low hyperope, so some people would think I should be able to see clearly in the distance but not close up - not a bit of it! I could read a car number plate across the road, but no chance at 20 metres, and there was a coach parked up the road a bit with a name on the front in letters about 18 inches high - it took a fierce squint before I could read that! I guess my bit of astigmatism doesn't help. </p><p>More presently as I was in London yesterday.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Aug 2007, 15:41</p><p>Good question, and not easy to answer. I guess it means lenses that show slight minification but no power rings or cut-in. Before anyone asks, the enormously strong plus lenses magnified the boy's eyes quite obviously. Also strong plus lenses have a way of 'holding' the light, not that I saw that this time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest</b>&nbsp;16 Aug 2007, 13:42</p><p>Julian </p><p>Interesting combination of sightings, thanks for that, but out of interest what do you consider to be low minus?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2007, 13:22</p><p>Well, I haven't jotted much in the last six months, but I had some particularly jottable spottings the other day - Monday it was. First, I had to call at the surgery. While I was waiting for my prescription to be made up a moderately cute youth (late teens) sat down opposite me. Casually dressed, untidy fair hair, pale complexion. In fact, nothing to write home about if it hadn't been for his glasses: biggish light brown plastic frames, and I reckoned a moderate plus Rx. </p><p>Later, shopping in Tesco (not the nearest one but a bigger one about 20 miles away) I had to exchange two shirts I'd bought that were the wrong size. Pleasant guy attended to me at Customer Services: mid 30s I guess, well-built, spiky fair hair going thin on top, short beard, semi-rimless specs with moderate minus lenses. I used the 'do-it-yourself' checkout and failed to get the points added to my loyalty card. This was sorted out by a cute young cashier (20-ish): slim figure, well set off by the uniform dark pants and blue checked shirt; short dark hair and ENORMOUSLY strong plus lenses in fairly shallow gold frames. About the same time I noticed a tall customer with a tan, fair hair and rimless specs, low minus. </p><p>Finally, having a couple of beers at a table outside the pub in the next village, I was observing two guys at the next table who were eating and drinking and discussing birdwatching (the pub offers good facilities). One was elderly and frankly no oil painting, though he wore strong minus glasses. It was the younger one who held my attention: tall and slim with short black hair, bright blue shirt and black casual pants, tanned complexion. When he looked my way his eyes turned out to be startlingly blue, but there was an odd look about them - although he was about 30 feet away I wondered if it was the effect of contacts...it was easy to persuade myself that when he looked up at the trees he was giving a slight squint. Anyway, he was the highlight of the day.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2007, 22:43</p><p>On the train to London yesterday (it gets pretty full after Cambridge) I noticed a guy a few seats away with fair hair and glasses; but it was only when he got up to alight at Kings Cross that I realized how interesting he was: nice figure, dark red polo shirt and short tight shorts, longish fair hair and short beard, nicely tanned legs (though I've seen, and indeed have, better calf muscles!). He was off the train and gone well before me, but at the end of the platform I saw him at the cash machine; quickly checked my wallet to see if I needed cash; decided I didn't; went to the loo--and he was there too!. Well, you don't look too long at other guys in there, at least I don't; and I didn't quite manage to follow him up the steps and observe the contours of his neat backside through his shorts. I had to get moving, so I made for the tube. </p><p>He was a lovely sight. Anybody who checks out www.hornyhoundogs.com, imagine Toby wearing semi-rimless glasses for low myopia and astigmatism and you've got, not a perfect likeness but the general idea.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2007, 23:35</p><p>I was waiting by the checkout in Tesco for a friend who was topping up her mobile phone, wehn I was fascinated by the sight of a big family emerging. What first caught my eye was three boys of junior school age, all wearing glasses with white wire frames. The two smaller ones had slight minus Rx, but the biggest of the three was quite seriously myopic. No surprise when Dad emerged to see that he too wore strong minus lenses (also in a wire frame). After that the plot thickened: Mum appeared, wearing black wire frames with plus lenses, followed by another small boy, with darker hair and complexion than the others, and plus lenses. There was a bigger boy in the group as well, wearing the sweatshirt of a local high school but (poor kid!) no glasses at all. </p><p>At first I thought I was seeing a clear instance of hereditary myopia, and obviously that's part of the story. But there are complications. Of course, not all the kids necessarily share two parents...or maybe they weren't one family at all, but two households sharing transport to shop for supplies.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2007, 02:52</p><p>Good grief! three months since I posted to this thread - what have I been thinking of? Never mind; I was in London for the weekend, and had a good few jottable sightings, mostly on trains. </p><p>On the train to London on Saturday: a thin dark guy boarded the train at Cambridge. He wore a grey shirt and Harry Potter glasses with a minus Rx - let's call it modest but not negligible! He took a seat a few rows in front of me and immediately took off his shirt, revealing a grey T-shirt and neat arms. Only sorry I couldn't get a better view - those specs were just right for him. </p><p>Later, on a bus, a guy in semi-rimless glasses with plus lenses - the metal strip at the top of each lens was actually in front of the glass, which showed above it. he and his (female) companion talked animatedly in what might have been a Scandinavian language. </p><p>Sunday morning I boarded a carriage on the tube behind a slim guy in shorts with strongish minus glasses, but he turned out to ne nothing to write home about. A bit further along however, was a really good-looking guy with short brown hair, T-shirt-shorts and trainers, with really muscular calves (nice!) who was reading a book through glasses with oblong gunmetal frames and low minus lenses. After a while he pushed his glasses up into his hair and continued to read bareyed. </p><p>Later, on another tube, a young guy with short blonde hair, oval gold frames and a really high minus Rx. Peevish expression which spoiled any effect he might have had. Not far from him an older, but still young, guy, with strong plus lenses. </p><p>Sunday trains will be Sunday trains and the train was replaced by a bus for part of the journey home because of engineering works. Opposite me on the bus was a very tall thin young guy - the length of his thighs was conspicuous and he can't have been comfortable on the bus seat - wearing black plastic frames, the front part being black laminate on clear plastic and s-t-r-o-n-g PLUS lenses; anything a short distance away was completely inverted through them. An interesting sight to finish the day with!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2007, 09:13</p><p>My first post for a while...the move duly happened, and after a week the phone was connected up. Now another fortnight till I get broadband; so for now I'm checking things out at an internet cafe in London between meetings. </p><p>In one of the pubs in the village where I'm now living, the landlord is a tall, slim guy with conspicuously fair hair. Each time I've seen him since I arrived he's been wearing glasses (I'd seen him in wire-rimmed glasses before but imagine he wore contacts most of the time). These are black rectangles with wide temples. I did say to him one evening at the bar, "I like your glasses; they really suit you;" and he replied, "Well, they're a bit different, aren't they?" But I couldn't help reflecting, if only he was female, or if only ehpc was gay...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2007, 18:17</p><p>Called at the Building Society this afternoon to register my change of address (just a week till I move). One of the staff ws servicing the cash dispenser: slim figure, grey pants and a shirt with a blue and white pattern, untidy hair worn moderately long, and a pair of specs that just made his appearance, for me anyway. Ordinary enough dark wire frames, minus lenses, not strong but not negligible either. I think I've seen him before at the counter with his glasses lying on it, but never wearing them. I only hope his girl friend (if that's what he's into) thinks spexy guys are sexy guys, 'cos he's the living proof.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2007, 07:47</p><p>Been away a coupe of days this week - to the village where I shall be living in a few weeks' time. A farmers' co-op in the district has set up a shop in a restored barn, selling fresh local produce: meat, fish, fruit, veg., cheese &amp;c; and I was shopping there yesterday. Behind me at the checkout was a very tall fair guy, around six foot four, who looked a bit like a farmer: quite a lot of fair hair, weatherbeaten complexion, heavy sweater, cord trousers tucked into what looked like boots but were in fact socks, worn with shoes. Rimless glasses with a modest minus Rx; I wished I'd had the presence of mind and the nerve to get a photo of him with my mobile phone. </p><p>Even more interesting, and I guess a few minutes earlier, was one of the staff of the butchery department who made a brief appearance out of the back room. This youngster (late teens or maybe early twenties) had a sallow complexion, a mass of black curly hair (I mean really curly) and fairly heavy black-framed specs. Although I was over half way down the building I could tell at once that his lenses were minus, and no slouch of a prescription either. Nice.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2006, 09:56</p><p>Took the car to the garage today to discuss the damage done by a car that ran into me. While I waited for the boss to finish a phone conversation his son came over to chat. He's a lumpy kind of youth who has recently started wearing semi-rimless glasses with brown platic tops and gunmetal temples, low minus. Eventually I said, "I like your glasses, by the way. They really suit you." His response was (to my mild amusement) "I'm as blind as a bat, I am." "You haven't had them long, have you?" "No." End of conversation.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Dec 2006, 02:52</p><p>Having lunch in a pub yestrday when a young couple sat down at the next table. The guy was tall, fair and quite slim, with short hair and a fresh complexion. He wore diamond-looking earrings in both ears, and gold semi-rimless glasses with minus lenses. So far, so good. He had large rings on at least three fingers of each hand. Why do guys who highlight their hands in this way not look after their nails better? His were grubby and possibly bitten, and a real turnoff.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Dec 2006, 08:51</p><p>Met a guy today whom I hadn't seen for years; couldn't place him at first as he was wearing glasses which I hadn't seen before (brown wire ovals with a definite but not high minus Rx). We chatted a bit and he told me he'd had eye surgery after both corneas had ruptured because of some genetic condition - but, he said, his vision with glasses is perfect. I said I hadn't seen him in them before but apparently he used to wear contacts. This ruptured cornea story was a new one on me though. Anyone else heard of it?</p><p></p><hr>

Have you seen the Schlepp twins--the guys on MTV's "I Wabt a New Face" a couple of years ago?  Both have virulent cases of acne and wear braces--but, alas no glasses.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2006, 00:17</p><p>That same day things improved...I arrived home and found my new iPod Nano had been delivered. Never had one before, couldn't even find out how to open the box! I was going out to dinner with a friend, who said, "Take it with you and fiddle with it at the table; somebody's sure to show an interest." I did just that; we sat near a young couple and while we waited I had another go at opening the box. After a minute or two I looked up and I had our neighbours' full attention: he said, "We're admiring your iPod" (it's one of the special edition red ones that contribute to AIDS relief and research in Africa). I explained the problem, and the girl came over, and after a few minutes discovered the secret was to peel off a transparent film. She produced her iPod (comlete with an iTrip); he lamented that his was broken. They were both quite charming: he had a beautiful figure, shown off by torn blue jeans and a bright red fleece, designer-untidy fair hair and, of course, glasses (why else would I be writing his?) Semi-rimless with a wide and fairly heavy brown frame, at least -4, maybe -5 or 6. Big blue eyes (in spite of the minification) and a loveley smile. When they got up and left, with a parting "Congratulations on your iPod," I noticed she was rather broad in the beam - but so much the better. Broad hips are supposed to be good for childbearing so she might give him lots of slim myopic sons to charm a future generation of old queens!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2006, 23:25</p><p>A frustrating non-sighting on a train the other day. On the last lap of a journey I managed to get a seat at a table which I always prefer. After I'd settled (not till then, I assure you!) I noticed that directly across the gangway was a good-looking young man. Fair, slightly gingery hair, clear fair complexion, white shirt with a blue check, black pants. Tie? I don't know, but at one point he put on a pullover. For a lot of the journey he was reading stuff from his mobile phone, or PDA - possibly surfing. On the table in front of him was a very stylish pair of rimless glasses, the hingeless variety - which he never once put on though he did move them across the table once or twice. My guess was they were low minus, maybe his first pair, but I'd have loved to see how they looked on his handsome face.</p><p></p><hr>

There were lots of people there and I had to take a seat near the front. Just after I found my seat two men came in and sat in the row in front. Both quite formally dressed though not exactly in black; one might have been pushing fifty, tall and fairly heavily built, the other in his 20s, tall, slim and quite cute (big brown eyes). Wondered if they were father and son, or colleagues, or what. The older one wore white metal frames well down his nose, with single vision minus lenses, and took them off to read something before the service started. The young one put on a pair of glasses as soon as he sat down (dark wire frames, minus lenses). I wasn't surprised to see the older man take his glasses off for the hymns - but I didn't expect to see the young guy do the same. After the last hymn he didn't put them back on, and wasn't wearing them when they left the church, but a few minutes later I saw them leaving in a car; he was in the passenger seat and I'm almost certain he was wearing them again. A new wearer perhaps?</p><p></p><hr>

I was shopping there the other day and was interested to see a family at the check-out; dad, mum and three young boys, no older than 15 so too young to be sexy - but two of them very definitely spexy. They both wore black oval frames with gold temples and s-t-r-o-n-g PLUS lenses. I wondered afterwards if perhaps they were twins. The third was younger but very like the others - but no glasses. I realized that Dad was also wearing plus glasses, though they didn't look as strong as the boys'. Why, I wondered, had the youngest lad been deprived of the hyperopia gene? Or could he have been wearing contacts?</p><p></p><hr>

Ticket holders were allowed in first, and the rest of us had to queue. I was behind three guys in T-shirts although it was a chilly evening. The one right in front of me wore a white T-shirt and was shivering with cold. He had close-cropped fairish hair, a line of beard round his chin, and a tiny wisp of moustache under his nose (didn't care for that; it put me in mind of Hitler!) Reflected that he was a guy who took a lot of care of his appearance, and then went out with other guys. Then, of course, his glasses: fairly low minus Rx, black frames, light plastic or maybe carbon fibre, temples that came straight back to grip his head rather than bend over his ears. A red spot near each end of the temples. Decidedly funky, and really well-chosen. Why is there nothing lie that when I go shopping for new specs?</p><p></p><hr>

But there was also a taller guy with short dark hair and a neat figure (especially round the backside) and plus lenses in a shallow gold frame, who seemed to be in the same gangways as me several times and ended up two behind me at the checkout. </p><p>Then, this morning, as I was going out a car passed driven by a Pakistani neighbour whom I've often seen wearing preppy round gold frames, quite strong minus; but this time he was in very smart rimless (or maybe semi-rimless) specs, noticeably thick at the edges. Finally, as I was on my way back in, a tall white guy came down the street and crossed over. Black hair, black-framed glasses whch he took off for a moment to rub his eyes. When he put them on again I could see that the lenses were minus though not so very strong.</p><p></p><hr>

Among those present I observed with interest:  </p><p>1. a slight lad of about 16 with wire-rimmed glasses, minus Rx, no more than -3. His specs were down his nose most of the time, and he either looked over them or tilted his head back to look through them. </p><p>2. a guy in his early 20s, fair-ginger hair, semi-rimless specs, low minus. Intrigued that, though it wasn't cold, he was wearing a warm-looking grey overcoat with a scarf wrapped round his neck. Grey jeans and white trainers. He was obviously with his family, including a younger boy with similar colouring (but no glasses). </p><p>3. a tall youth with dark hair and brown eyes, casually dressed, who, fairly late in the proceedings, put on a pair of specs with dark plastic frames and a low Rx (minus I thought but couldn't be sure) and went around chatting to people and constantly playing with a very new glasses case. Very new wearer, I wonder?</p><p></p><hr>

He looked at me; there was something very familiar about his face, and a hint of recognition, but we didn't actually speak. Walking back later, I had a side view of him as he manned a till, and again he was extremely familiar. I've been wondering all week whether, and how, I know him. Would I be mentioning him here if he hadn't worn glasses? Dark wire frames, rounded-off oblongs, with a moderate plus Rx. Looked good with his black hair.</p><p></p><hr>

As she was getting out of the car, the automatic doors opened and a middle-aged man came out, leg bandaged or in plaster, and walking with crutches. With him was another guy, but all I could see of him was a pair of much-torn grey denim jeans. My curiosity was aroused - and so was I when they got to the bottom of the ramp and I was able to see the top half of the younger guy - longish fair hair with highlights, black wire ovals with a moderate minus Rx. Nice!</p><p></p><hr>

Another sighting from the car: yesterday on the ring road I was stationary at traffic lights. Glancing in the mirror, I thought the driver of the car behind wasn't bad looking - fair hair, fair complexion. Then he moved his head and the light caught the edges of rimless specs which hadn't been visible till then. As we proceeded (there are two lots of road works and several sets of lights) I could see substantial cut-in at one point. We took the same turn-off, but then I took another turning and he shot past.

The lad was quite young, but I couldn't help noticing that whichever way he looked he gave a little squint. In a few years' time, with the glasses he is starting to need, he will certainly be a wonderful piece of eye candy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2006, 00:42</p><p>I've been away on holiday in Scotland. A broken-down car cramped my style a bit, but I walked around a lot - as always with my eyes open and my glasses clean. Lots of sexy spexy guys; lots of guys in shorts or three-quarter pants; occasionally both at once!  </p><p>One night I was eating pizza (alone!) in a pleasant and fairly crowded Italian restaurant, consumed with envy of all the people around who were eating mussels (I'd love to eat mussels, but the after-effects are awful!). The place got a bit quieter towards closing time, but fairly late on they pushed tables together for a party of six - three guys and three girls, though they weren't obviously three couples. None of the girls wore glasses (and in any case I don't do girls) but the guys! At first I was reluctantly coming to the conclusion that the most interesting was the one who was seated with his back to me: no glasses ::( but longish, thick fair hair with highlights that might have been natural or might not, and three-quarter pants that revealed tanned, muscular,  hairy calves. But I kept watching. The guy opposite him was certainly cute: fairly tall, medium build, fairish hair, designer stubble, pleasant smile, semi-rimless specs with a low minus Rx. Wouldn't kick him out of bed, that's for sure. But in the end the third one was the most fascinating of all: slimmer build, medium coloured hair, black wire frames, HIGH minus. Sombre expression except when he smiled or laughed, which he did frequently - I think that was what got me. </p><p>A pleasant evening, and the pizza was good too -  cappriciosa with added anchovies.</p><p></p><hr>

In the time before the lights changed to green he crossed two roads and walked down the road I was on, on the opposite side. Two glimpses between other vehicles revealed fairish hair which looked as if he was letting a bleached Mohican mane grow out, decent posture, clear fair complexion and dark wire frames with strong plus lenses. For once I was glad to sit so long at a red light ::)</p><p></p><hr>

Weather hot, though a shade milder then the previous day. Lots of sexy spexy guys; lots of guy in shorts, results varied in quality but a fine display of knees and calves - another Jules preference. </p><p>Near us as we had our morning coffee, a young couple with a baby in a pushchair, both in shorts (and her legs were rather spectacular!) Everywhere he looked, he squinted - his glasses were dangling from the front of his T-shirt. Eventually he put them on for a minute or two (white metal) but them took them off and lay down on the grass. Passed them several times in the course of the day, and he had his glasses on; -3, maybe -4. Later in the afternoon at a refreshment place they were sitting at a table near us and his glasses were lying on the table. </p><p>Abut the same time I passed another young couple on the grass; he wore three-quarter pants and a T-shirt and was nicely tanned. I noticed he had a pair of glasses in his hair, so I contrived to pass a bit closer, just to satisfy myself they weren't just shades. They weren't - semi-rimless and, I thought, minus. On my return journey I again passed by them; they were talking to a friend who was passing, and I saw the guy take his glasses out of his hair; for one glorious moment I thought he was going to put them on properly, but (alas!) he looked at them and pushed them back into his hair, which was drak and wavy. </p><p>Finally, stopped at a pub on the way home for food and beer. Pleasant, well-spoken barman with black semi-rimless frames and a minus Rx. His hair was black and long, tied in a pony-tail.

He had a pleasant face and a lovely smile. A lock of orange/green hair was entwined round the right temple of his glasses, which were as un-funky as could be: smart rimless, gold wire, low minus. He was with two other people, a girl less funky than he and an older guy fairly traditionally dressd. They all wore glasses and they weren't apeaking English: I thought German, but the friend I was with speaks German and thought it might be Swedish.</p><p></p><hr>

Went to a vilage pub for supper the other evening, and while I was ordering the food at the bar in the dining room I noticed a cute guy in the other bar: slim, pale complexion, fawn T-shirt with brown trim; and from the neck of his T-shirt hung a pair of glasses with white wire frames. When I looked again the sunlight coming in through the window had darkened the lenses a bit. Kept my eyes open; when my friend and I left he was sitting at a table out of doors with a group of others, specs still dangling from his T-shirt. No chance of seeing what his Rx was, but it could well have been low minus...perhaps he wore them to drive there and then didn't feel the need of them in the pub or even in the garden. Pity. </p><p>The next day, shopping in a strange town, found a pub for lunch, quite dark inside. While I was at the bar a guy, maybe 40-ish, came in wearing shades and took them off and put them on the bar. Ten minutes later he picked them up and put them on again; the lenses were now clear and had a respectable plus prescription with somne cylinder.</p><p></p><hr>

Uniform blue shirt with top button undone, tie. Fresh complexion, highlights in hair - couldn't say whether the sun had done it or it came  out of a bottle. Altogether as different as possible from bank clerks as they used to be. </p><p>I'd like to jot about him, but I can't, 'cos he wasn't wearing glasses, or even squinting; and (as far as I could see) no contact lenses in his bright blue eyes.

When he rang the door bell he had already parked on the drive - blocking me in in the garage, and I needed to go out almost immediately. So he backed out, putting his glasses on to do so, and I drove straight out; I always back in. As he looked over his shoulder I could see definite minification of the building across the street; but by the time I was back Mike was out of the car and bareyed. Obviously as far as he's concerned glasses are things he wears to drive; but I still haven't seen how he looks wearing them.</p><p></p><hr>

An engineer has been in the house most of the day renewing some parts of the central heating system. I know the guy from previous service calls, and like him: 40ish, no great beauty but no gargoyle either. Durinbg the morning he needed to go out for some spare parts, but his van (a gleaming white Vauxhall Astra) was blocked in on the drive by the green Vauxhall Astra belonging to the gardener who comes in each week. They were both blocking my blue Vauxhall Corsa (in the garage) so I took the opportunity to get it out. As Mike (the engineer) drove off I noticed with interest that he was now wearing glasses. Didn't see him come back, but of course he was now blocking the gardener in. He put his glasses on again to reverse out and drive back in, and I contrived to be at the back door when he parked. He seemed simultaneously to switch off with one hand and with the other take his glasses off and put them down on the passenger seat - so I still didn't get to see him wearing them. But as I went out to my own car I had a good look, and there was a beautiful pair of rimless specs, as new and sparkling as the car, with definite but not extreme thickness at the edges. He's due back in the morning, so we shall see what we shall see - or not. But I do wish some of the myopes who write on other threads and don't need, or don't want, to wear their glasses full time, would be as sensible as Mike and have their own pair handy for when they do need them.</p><p></p><hr>

Nice disco - retro repertoire. Sitting at a table with a pleasant lad of 20, designer scruffy, unshaven, partly-bleached hair, black wire frames with high plus pebbles. Also at the table a charming and conservatively-dressed youth of 23 with his parents (no sign of a girl friend). His mother, who was next to me and is obviously very proud of him, told me he is joining the RAF soon as an officer cadet, but his entry has been delayed because of poor visual acuity caused by excessive use of contact lenses. I looked with renewed interest - I've seen him on visits to their church over the last few years but don't remember him wearing glasses. Wish he would. Earlier, in church, I'd noticed a young man with short fair hair and a blue checked cheesecloth shirt with a pair of glasses hanging from the pocket - black wire frames. At the reception he was at the far end of the room with his wife, but didn't seem to put his specs in front of his eyes. Later in the evening I saw him go up to the bar wearing them, but take them off, put them down while he ordered, and put them back on when he took the drinks back to his table. Later still I saw him wearing them, but never got a proper look to see what his Rx was. Hint of low minus, which would have made sense if he was a new wearer. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Smart gunmetal wire frames, not quite circular, with an outward bend in the temples, and tinted minus lenses. Nice - very. </p><p>Saturday, wedding in church, of a couple I've mentioned before (mentioned him at any rate) - big guy with crisp fairish hair and dimples, terminally sexy. For his wedding he was (as I expected) wearing contacts ::( but the previous Sunday he had been in church wearing new glasses: the previous ones were gunmetal oblongs, these are smaller frames in black wire. I said to him then, "You look different; have you got new glasses?" and he said I was the first person who'd noticed. Funny how a guy will get new glasses before his wedding and then wear contacts on the day. I suppose the new ones might be stronger; couldn't tell.</p><p></p><hr>

Spotted a good-looking guy, not young, but slim with longish blond hair that looked sunbleached. Quite a lot of the time he was in a green t-shirt and shorts; later he was more formally dressed. One morning at breakfast he appeared in glasses - they came and went but by the thirs day he seemed to be wearing them full time: gold semi-rimless bifocals, maybe minus 6 or 8.</p><p></p><hr>

Black wire frames, couldn't see the lenses. They looked good on him. About ten to fifteen minutes later, coming back up the street, a guy with short reddish hair, taller than the first but not as slim; black wire again but might have been semi-rimless; strongish minus.</p><p></p><hr>

Tallish, lean, pale complexion, shaved head - feeling I might have seen him somewhere before but no idea where. Black wire frames with tinted lenses - out of doors afterwards lenses darkened a lot more, so obviously photochromic. Not strong; I thought low minus, or maybe mostly cylinder. Definitely one for Bronwyn!</p><p></p><hr>

Both quite good-looking in short-sleeved white shirts and black gilets. But the taller one, who took my statement and wrote it down, wore glasses: dark wire, designer frames I think, with plus lenses. Not obviously strong at first glance, but as I observed for the best part of an hour, definitely stronger than mine. Not that that's saying much.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;26 Apr 2006, 10:35</p><p>A fascinating visit to Sainsburys yesterday. Their petrol was the cheapest around (2p a litre less than the next cheapest) so I filled up. At the checkout a Pakistani guy, not the best-looking ever, but chatty and friendly, wearing a nice pair of rimless specs with a moderate-to-high minus Rx (-5? -6?) which made him attractive enough to keep my chatting. Even more interesting, however: when shopping in the store I've several times noticed a youth wearing very dark glasses and looking over the tops of them a lot of time. Yesterday he was looking after the wines and spirit counter; I asked him about a particular product; he was very apologetic about not knowing that department but made a great effort to find the product I wanted (it was out of stock). After all this conversation I very daringly said, "I hope you don't mind my asking, but why do you wear such dark glasses?" "Because I'm severely dyslexic." He took his glasses off and let me try them (they're dark green with plus lenses, black wire frames) and talked quite freely and knowledgeably about his dyslexia, which hadn't been diagnosed till he was 18. He'd done his reading through a coloured acetate sheet for a while, before opting for specs - and of course he looks over the top to see the proper colours of things. I lerned quite a lot from him.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2006, 04:11</p><p>Lunch time yesterday, the weather was foul (rain/hail/sleet/snow). Headed for the nearest food pub for lunch, the same one as last week, only to find that the 'new' spexy chef I jotted about last week has left without notice. So I shan't get to observe him any more. In conversation with the owners I learned he has a son in this 20s, so has to be older than he looks. Old enough, I guess, for a bit of presbyopia, but hardly to be dependent on glasses for work at arms length. Surely a a guy who uses them the way he did has to be hyperopic as well. But that's all speculation.  </p><p>Sitting at the bar was a guy with a nice slim figure (so unlike mine!) and short ginger hair wearing semi-rimless glasses. Couldn't get a look at him full-face, but they seemed quite strong minus, maybe -5. As he got up and left another guy came in and took his place: bright red T-shirt (Manchester United?) and red trainers. Rimless glasses with black wire temples and the kind of confusing lenses that usually mean more astigmatism than anything, but some minus.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2006, 18:29</p><p>There's a young man with similar behavior that serves at the counter in a small Greek/Mediterranean restaurant I frequent for lunch.  He wears strong looking plus glasses which he often has perched at the end of his nose -- looking over them for distance. </p><p> </p><p>I suspect he's a hyperope who is trying to accomodate for distance to avoid becoming dependent on his glasses but is unable to manage for close work -- in this case handling the cash register.  I've noticed he's more frequently looking through the glasses for distance and suspect he's losing the battle to avoid full time wear.</p><p></p><hr>

Since then it's been bar snacks in the week and Sunday roasts. A new couple took over a couple of years ago, and have tried to increase the food trade again. I hadn't been in for a while, and find they have franchised the kitchen out to a new chef, who has plans for a very impressive 'specials' menu at very reasonable prices. I was with a friend (female) who knows I like men, likes men herself, and is always ready to compare notes, but doesn't share or even know about my passion for guys in glasses. I was sitting with my back to the room ::( For some of the time we were there the chef and his young lady had come out of the kitchen and were chatting to friends at a table not far from us. I couldn't see the new Specials board, without turning round, but when I did turn round to read the menu I also took in a tall slim guy with a big nose and a shock of curly black hair, wearing s white T-shirt and a red neckerchief, and playing with a pair of rimless glasses which, I could see, had significantly plus lenses. After the meal we stood chatting to the landlady for a while. I had a partial view of the kitchen, and could see him, on an off. He was wearing his glasses well down his nose and looking through them at what he was doing and over them when he looked across the room. When he eventually came out and sat down to his own lunch he had taken them right off. Interesting. </p><p>Maybe he is a lot older then he looks; maybe he has premature presbyopia; or maybe he's a latent hyperope who has learned to see through his glasses. Time will tell. So will I if I discover more.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wayne</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2006, 11:16</p><p>Hi Julian, </p><p>Nice sighting!  As for contacts vs glasses, it can be hard to say.  Those who use extended wear usually need to wear glasses for a day every week or two.  Or he might have run out of disposable contacts.  Many shops in the US don't stock the stronger prescriptions, requiring one to order them a few days in advance.  Or perhaps he prefers glasses -- finds contacts uncomfortable or hates the hassle of taking them out at night and putting them in in the morning or he prefers the look (one can hope). </p><p> </p><p>I think I mentioned in some thread recently that it surprises me (pleasantly) that I seem to see a greater percentage of people wearing glasses these days than in the pre-contacts era.  This despite the popularity and availability of contacts, not to mention lasik.  It would seem the alternatives to glasses haven't yet caught up with the increasing numbers with poor eyesight.  </p><p> </p><p>Saml2744 --  I agree that new euphemisms can be annoying.  Stores no longer have clerks and baggers and stockers, etc., they have "associates".  Shops and restaurants don't have customers, they have "guests".  If I were really a guest I think I resent being expected to pay for my meal.  Still, I believe that in the US the person in charge of the train has always been called the conductor -- not that we have much of a passenger rail system left in this country (sadly).</p><p></p><hr>

Last night, however, I went to a steak bar for dinner, and managed to manoeuvre myself to get a view of the next table, where there was a handsome young man in glasses eating with his wife or girl friend. He was tall, with short, neat, dark hair - not black but very dark brown. Pleasant looking face (side view). Either hadn't shaved or had a very heavy five o'clock shadow. Black hooded fleece. His glasses had black metal frames (just a bit too substantial to call them wire). It wasn't easy to get a view of the lenses, as he was concentrating on his food and his companion, but I had an impression of a substantial minus Rx, though the lenses weren't thick. This was finally confirmed when they got up to go, but I only got a glimpse as they passed. Power rings well in evidence; I guess around -7 or -8. Did just wonder whether he always wears glasses or if I'd just caught him having a break from contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

Yesterday afternoon I was just parking the cdar when I saw two teenage lads approaching with bags of newspapers to deliver. Interested, as the taller one was clearly wearing glasses with dark wire frames. Lingered over locking up so as to get a closer lookand he wasn't, and hadn't been, wearing anything of the kind! Combination of wihful thiunking and the kind of eye sockets that look 'framed' I suppose. </p><p>And, the other day, caught sight of my garage foreman friend as he got out of his car to start work. Wearing his glasses, so it is full time with him. And the lenses were darkobviously photosensitive. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sam12744</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2006, 03:19</p><p>I know this is off topic,but Julian did start it! I get quite exercised about these stupid privatised train operating companies trying to expunge 200 years of railway history.If the man checks tickets on a train,he is a Travelling Ticket Inspector.If he is in charge of the train ,he is a Guard,not a Conductor(does he have an orchestra or a bus?),or a Train Manager! What is wrong with long-establised and logical tradition?And Julian is quite right:passengers travel on trains;customers buy things in shops(though at the price of Virgin's tickets,one could well be buying the whole train!). </p><p>Best Regards, </p><p>Sam.</p><p></p><hr>

The ticket collector (they call them train managers now and yes, I know they do a bit more than check tickets) was a tall, broad-shouldered guy with fair hair and complexion, heavy jowls and semi-rimless glasses, dark wire, with a pretty strong minus Rx. Looked good in his uniform (bright red jacket on Virgin trains). The day's star sighting, however, was another passenger (only they will call us customers these days) sitting diagonally opposite me: very tall and slim, in navy jeans and sweater; short black hair with flecks of grey, well-kept hands, light blue eyes behind minus lenses, at a guess -3 or 4, in heavy clear plastic frames. I did amuse myself imagining how he'd look with different specs (not a thing I often do for some reason), and decided a similar frame in black would work OK, and so would a Harry Potter wire frame, but actually he'd made an excellent choice. The effect was very striking.</p><p></p><hr>

It was very crowded (it went totally non-smoking at the beginning of the year and has been busier ever since) and as I made my way to the bar I caught sight of a very handsome young man in glassesmore about him in a minute. Behind the bar was the lovely David whom I've jotted about a few times before, though perhaps not as a barman; he wasn't wearing his glasses, indeed I've only twice seen them in over two years, but as an occasionally spexy guy I reckon he qualifies for a mention here. He's tall and slim, fresh complexion, good teeth, black hair and beard...last night his hair was very short, not shaved but short enough for his scalp to shine through, and his beard was about the same length. He knows how to dress too: always black slacks and T-shirt, and last night a thin black jacket thing with a hood. He's a really nice guy besides being the most delicious eye candy, even without his black wire ovals and low minus lenses which improve on perfection...doesn't seem to squint without them. </p><p>Anyway, back to the other customer whom I was able to observe at intervals as I chatted to various friends. This guy was probably 30ish, slim figure (tho' slightly round-shouldered). Jeans, light green T-shirt, necklace, kind of a choker.  Spiky dark hair, palish complexion but a bit of colour in his cheeks. Biggish very straight nose, very pleasant smile. Dark brown wire frames with a substantial minus Rx: -5 at the very least, maybe a bit more. The specs were very new and shiny looking, and seemed to sit very high on his nose and a long way from his eyes. Thinking about this, one possibility is that they are new and haven't settled on his face yet; another is that I caught him having an occasional rest from contacts...if so I was really lucky! Never seen him before, but he seemed to know quite a few people. But then I don't usually go to that particular pub on a Sunday night. Perhaps he does. perhaps I ought to go a bit more.</p><p></p><hr>

Pair of black wire framed glasses hanging from th front of his sweater. Wondered what he needed them for and why he kept them handy but didn't wear them. Near vision? Distant vision?...A little later, as I drove along a street, cute youth walking in the opposite direction: fair hair, wire frames, minus...Shopping in ASDA later in the evening, several times passed a guy with a splendid head of curly black hair, black-framed glasses with a strong minus Rx...</p><p></p><hr>

As I was getting back into the car, I saw a young couple approaching with two small children. Dad was a cheerful-looking youth, casually dressed, with spiky hair and strong plus specs (wire frames). At least one of the kids also had strong plus specs. They got into the car two in front of mine and drive off, so I didn't get as close a look as I was hoping for; but I was left reflecting on heredity.</p><p></p><hr>

I don't normally see the mechanic who is working on the car, but I had a rather complicated wiring problem in the dashboard, so he came to the waiting room to ask me some questions.  An attractive man, burly, in his thirties wearing the typical, tasteless frames men often choose--huge gold-rimmed aviator style with a weak plus prescription.  I thought no more about it. </p><p> </p><p>The next time I saw him, he came out to ask me a question while he was working on the car; he had changed glasses--rectangular, rimless, with a considerably stonger plus prescription (no obvious bifocal or progressive RX). They suited him well, and he peered over the top to talk with me.  Later, he had the same glasses on when he came out to do the paper work.  However, when he brought the car around, he had the weaker aviator glasses back on. </p><p> </p><p>His RX needs were obvious--he'd probably been a long-time plus wearer, but as he was approaching forty needed more help for close work and was avoiding bifocals.  Unlike you, I was not able to muster up the courage to say anything but just silently observed! </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

Again met by the foreman, again in his glasses. Definitely plus, definitely not bifocal or progressivebut none of the 'on-off, on-off' business one expects with readers; he obviously wears them full time, at least while he's at work. I took my  courage in both hands and said, "You don't usually wear glasses, do you?" "I've had them since September," was the reply. "I was getting a lot of headaches; strain and old age." "Oh well, it comes to us all," said I. "Anyway, they look all right on you." "I'd wear anything to get rid of the headaches," he said. "I'd wear a Tommy Cooper hat if I had to!" So I guess it's hyperopia making itself manifest with presbyopia still to come. Astigmatism too perhaps though no signs of a lot of cylinder.</p><p></p><hr>

No sign of the boss, who's cute but not spexy (though he has to be at the age where presbyopia sets in). Instead, the foreman dealt with me. He is a lean guy with short black hair, sculptured features and a high colour, altogether pretty easy on the eye; but yesterday the image was enhanced by a shiny new pair of specs: dark wire frames, fairly standard shape. Low plus Rx I reckon; maybe progressives - must see how much more I can see when I take the car in.</p><p></p><hr>

Be that as it may, I was interested to see a cute guy on one of the checkouts this evening: uniform blue shirt, crinkly black hair, brown eyes, skin so dark I wondered at first if he was Asian, but he was actually white (his name was Ben) - could conceivably have been all or part Italian. Oh, and of course he wore glasses: black wire ovals that went well with his whole image - and he wouldn't have seen much without them. -5? -6? Nice anyway.</p><p></p><hr>

When their crash helmets and dark goggles came off, they were both spexy guys: one wore dark wire frames; the other rimless glasses with a substantial minus Rx, at least -5 I'd say. </p><p>And the programme before that was a wildlife/plantlife feature by Bill Oddie, a guy of around my age whom I first saw in a revue in 1963 or so and was one of 'The Goodies' (a group of zany comedians) but certainly knew his stuff and presented it light-heartedly. Grey hair and beard, rimless bifocals with not-to-be-sneezed-at plus lenses - never used to be in glasses till recently. I put him down as a no-longer-latent hyperope.</p><p></p><hr>

The reason I mention him, of course, is his glasses: black wire frames and the strongest of many plus lenses in the party - evidently a gene for hyperopia in the family.</p><p></p><hr>

I'd say the second is likelier than the first, as he was maybe in his twenties when presbyopia isn't impossible, but less likely than hyperopia. Nice to get some feedback BTW.</p><p></p><hr>

Sallow complexion, close-cropped black hair, black wire ovals with strong plus lenses. A minute or two later he was moving a load of stuff around - no glasses. Puzzled. </p><p>About the same time in the same part of the store, a customer, tall guy with a neat figure, dressed in brown - dark brown jeans, a bit faded, smart brown shoes. Face and specs a bit disappointing: pale complexion, semi-rimless, low minus, not to well-fitting. Had two girls with him... oh well, there's safety in numbers ::)</p><p></p><hr>

I wrote this on the train to London last Thursday, entranced by a young guy a couple of seats away: fairly tall and slim, casually dressed (trainers, slacks, black sweater with the sleeves rolled up, no shirt as far as I could see); pale complexion, long straight nose, dark hair with dressing on it; black wire frames, minus lenses, sitting away from his eyes a bit; reminds me of the kind of young men I used to 'like the look of' when I was too young and innocent to understand what was going on inside me. Unfortunately he was sitting with his back to me; on the other hand that meant I could observe unobserved! </p><p>Now that I've started jotting...a couple of weeks ago I had to go to London by car, and did some shopping and eating at the Brent Cross Shopping Centre. On the way to lunch, fascinated to observe an Indian (or Pakistani?) couple manoeuvring a TWIN pushchair up the escalator, especially as the man was very handsome, with a heavy five o'clock shadow (it was around noon!) and, again, black wire frames with really strong minus lenses, maybe -8...once the twin girls got out of the pushchair they were as full of mischief as a wagonload of monkeys! Later that day, stopped on the way home at a motorway service station...serving on a stand selling baguettes and such was a very pretty blond boy with gold-framed glasses that were just perfect on his face; not too sure of the Rx but suspect low minus. </p><p>Finally, a cautionary tale. On two evenings this week I've been to carol services - in church - arranged by the school where I'm a governor. On both evenings I've been chatting afterwards to a group of teachers and the same young boy has waited twenty minutes after the others for a parent to collect him. The first evening I had a quick impression of a very handsome young man with black-framed specs saying "Come on, hurry up" and an indignant Head. The second evening she was ready for him, and said firmly, "Mr  , you have kept your son and the staff waiting twice. I'm expecting an explanation and an apology." In the time it took him to mutter something, I was able to see that his complexion was less perfect than I'd thought at first glimpse - but his glasses were more interesting: black wire with a strong plus Rx. Moral: a good figure and face and a well-chosen pair of specs don't make a nice guy. And, of course, first impressions can be misleading.</p><p></p><hr>

In the car yesterday I happened to hear 'The Learning Curve' on BBC Radio 4; there was a feature about a condition called Meares-Irlen syndrome: apparently when some children read, the words on the page start to move around. Using different coloured overlays over the text has been found to make the words stay still...and in some cases the children have to be fitted with glasses with coloured lenses - the colour specific to the child. If anyone wants to follow this up it'll be repeated on Sunday at 23.00 (GMT)</p><p></p><hr>

When he got out of the van he had taken his glasses off - to my disgust, especially as he was quite good looking: short fair hair, decent figure; maybe pushing forty but well worth a look. I watched with interest while he went into the premises, and in due course came out again and went to his van. To my UTTER disgust, just as he was picking his glasses up from the passenger seat my turn came up and I had to drive on, so I never got a proper look at him with his specs on. </p><p>Later in the evening I went into ASDA; just inside there was a guy chatting to some of the staff: longish dark hair, a bit untidy, unshaven, black oval frames, plastic-covered wire, with a decent minus Rx, maybe -4. I hung around for a minute or two, but there was no merchandise in that area to provide an excuse for loitering...he had the cutest smile. </p><p>A few minutes later, a couple examining the goods on one of the shelves. He'd had all his hair shaved off, and was wearing black wire oblong glasses, Rx not high but I couldn't get to see the lenses properly. Looked out for them as I carried on round the store, but no sign. </p><p>All very nice, but it would have been even better if I'd got a better view of all three!</p><p></p><hr>

Dad has to be about my age; I've known him, at least by sight, for the best part of 40 years; he's no oil painting, and never was - but his son! Judging by his father's age, could be in his thirties, but I'd put him in the twenties; well over six feet tall, slim, with short black hair and fresh complexion; long straight nose, good teeth. Specs about -8 in black wire oblong frames. Definitely a sight for sore eyes!</p><p></p><hr>

First, the young couple I mentioned the week before were there again - and the guy didn't put his glasses on once. I suppose he could have had contacts in, though my impression was that his Rx was too low to bother with contacts. Anyway, he's a thing of beauty bareyed; the glasses just add the finishing touch. Secondly, there's another couple also on the way to getting married; they're there quite often. He's big and as butch as old boots with short hair - and dimples. He's really sexy, and I'm not the only person in church who thinks so. He is also quite myopic, judging by the cut-in and minification when he wears his glasses; the lenses aren't thick, so I suspect high index. Anyway, it was obviously one of his days for contacts (he once told me his vision is better with contacts, and he doesn't like seeing the frames of his glasses). So it was a case of two sexy spexy guys without their spex ::( </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

They obviously did their shopping separately (and weren't buying much) because one of them was behind me at the 'baskets only' checkout, and the other was waiting for him holding hwta he'd bought in his hand. then they left together, got in a car, and drove off. The one who was waiting was the heavier of the two, maybe a bit taller; dark casual clothes, unshaven, rounded-off oblong frames, black wire, with really strong plus lenses. The other was in jeans and a maroon polo shirt, and had a small goatee beard. His glasses, also black wire, were oval, and the lenses were really interesting, though I couldn't get a proper look. My impression was that the left one was plus, while the right one may have been one of those confusing ones with more cylinder than sphere. At one glance I seemed to see minification, at another inversion. </p><p>A nice sight for an autumn evening.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132708/http://eyescene.net/bbs/real.html" target="_blank">Julian</a></b>&nbsp;02 Oct 2005, 12:50</p><p>A real five-star sighting in church this morning...when I got there, about five minutes before Mass started, I noticed a youg couple, strangers, sitting near the front (it turned out they're getting married next month and had come to hear their banns). She was small and dark; he was fair and quite talldirty fair hair, peaches and cream complexion, blue jeans, white sweater. Nice sight for a cold Sunday morning, I thought, and thought no more, until the next time I looked in their direction, and saw that he was now wearing glassesgold wire, almond-shaped, lowish Rx. At first glance I thought they were low plus; later from an different angle they looked like a stronger plus, maybe with cylinder; when we passed the time of day after the service I thought I saw some cut-in. Interim verdict: another example of the curious effect of a lens with more cylinder than sphere. Definitive opinion: she's a lucky girl.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132708/http://eyescene.net/bbs/real.html" target="_blank">Julian</a></b>&nbsp;26 Sep 2005, 04:55</p><p>One day last week I was parking the car close to a pedestrian subway when a cute coloured youth emerged. His glasses were oblong, very dark blue frames, and s-t-r-o-n-g tinted lenses; my guess is -8 or even -9. AND he was wearing shorts that showed well-muscled calves. </p><p>Saturday afternoon, I was in Bristol and had an hour or so to kill. None of the pubs appealed and I went into a café for a cold drink. Three young spexy guys came in on my heels and sat at the next table: the tallest had a shaggy beard and black wire frames with fairly strong minus lenses - he was the least interesting of the three; the next was smaller and slimmer and had a rather elegant posture, kind of camp maybe, also wire frames, also minus but not so strong; the third was black (well, café-au-lait) with short hair and rimless specs, low minus, photosensitive, and he wore shorts and sandals without socks - nice legs. A nice trio altogether.</p><p></p><hr>

As I was putting my petrol in I saw one of the assistants come over from the main store and go into the kiosk, and noticed he was wearing dark-framed semi-rimless glasses. When I went in to pay, he was behind the counter along with two other guys; he took his glases off and cleaned them on his shirt (it was raining).Finally he put them back on; the semi-rims were dark plastic, not too heavy, and the Rx was low minus with significant cylinder. He had a bit of beard, or maybe he just hadn't shaved for a day or three - but the whole effect brightened a miserable afternoon (weatherwise I mean)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132708/http://eyescene.net/bbs/real.html" target="_blank">Julian</a></b>&nbsp;03 Sep 2005, 11:19</p><p>Just back from a week away (and back on my own computer). A few jotworthy sightings ... In the course of the week I've met up with five or six friends who've got new glasses in the few months since I saw them last; all semi-rimless except one - and his are fully rimless! </p><p> </p><p>In the cafeteria where we have meals, one of the assistants is a very tall thin boy with untidy dark hair and a sallow complexion, three little dark moles on his right cheek. Dark wire oblongs with a lowish minus Rx - not so low that he ever appears without them. Permanently worried expression: occasionally smiles when he talks to other members of staff; never seen him look at, never mind talk to, any of the residents. </p><p> </p><p>Spent some time with a guy, a lot younger than me, with a pale complexion, green eyes and a thatch of black hair going a bit grey. Black ovals, low minus. One night while a group of us were chatting in the pub he took his specs off and left them on the table, revealing a long, very straight nose. </p><p> </p><p>Another small dark guy I know arrived wearing dark wire oblongs with a not-to-be-sneezed-at minus Rx...never seen him in glasses before, and didn't see him wearing them the rest of the week. I guess he took his contacts out for the journey (and I wasn't around when he left so don't know if he changed back). </p><p> </p><p>Kept noticing a plump young man, not bad looking, with short dark hair and brown eyes...quite a lot of the time he was wearing shades (Rx? non-Rx?) on top of his head; other times glasses with a low minus Rx; occasionally neither. Never saw him squint when he had no glasses on - but then some people don't. </p><p> </p><p>The week's star sighting was the landlord of the pub: tall, fairly slim, energetic; clear fair complexion and strikingly blond hair which may or may not be natural. On Wednesday evening he was wearing glasses - white wire frames, maybe -3. Looked good. Guess he was having an evening off contacts, 'cause I never saw him ins specs at any other time. </p><p> </p><p>Finally. I was going round a stately home yesterday afternoon. Just in front of me a young guy with a young lady and a little girl. Not a married couple, or even a couple at all I guess. She wore glasses; he didn't. He was expressing his opinions freely and not quietly in an educated, not to say affected, accent. After one of his comments I said quietly to the guide, "What an insufferable young man," and she said she'd been embarrassed by the way he stood extremely close to her ... when he read anything he held it about six inches from his eyes, and when he looked closely at anything it was as close as that. There was an odd look about his eyes, and he was very pale - an unhealthy pallor. On the other hand he seemed to see distant things quite well. Sudden thought: I remember jotting eighteen months or so ago about a guy who'd broken his glasses and struggled  like that to read, but turned out to be a high hyperope. I wonder if that was the problem. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2005, 09:33</p><p>At the coach station this lunchtime seeing a friend off to London. Quite a few people around: I particularly noticed a young guy, casually dressed, with a pale complexion and short dark hair. He was wearing the most beautiful oval rimless glasses (modest minus); the temples were so fine and the lenses sat so far from his eyes that at first glance they looked like pince-nez. Without the specs I wouldn't have looked twice at him, but... He obviously had a few friends seeing him off, because once his bags were loaded on he embraced several other young guys and kissed an older man who could easily have been his father. But I was pleased to see so much diplay of  affection between men!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2005, 18:58</p><p>Yes, that's cool, Watcher! </p><p>Two more glimpses from the car...as I was leaving home this morning a slim youth in jeans, a red top and glasses passed on the other side of the street. I took a longer route than I'd intended so as to get a closer look at him. Hair fairish and quite long, gold frames with a strong minus Rx, florid acne. Couldn't help thinking of that song with the refrain 'Nice legs; shame about your face'...a minute or two later as I was stationary at traffic lights, a fairly stocky guy was walking down, again on the opposite side: light brown hair, light brown shirt, light brown shorts (nice legs!) and dark wire frames. No clue to the Rx, and I wasn't about to make any more detours - but he was decidedly ornamental!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Watcher</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2005, 18:06</p><p>Down at the local supermarket yesterday looking for artichokes and couldn't find any so I asked one of the assistants for help. He was about 17, lots of long brown curls but no specs.  We went up and down the vegetable rows until I noticed him peering at the labels from about 6 inches!! A real myope but no glasses.  He finally called one of his mates over who was wearing wire oval specs with a very high Rx and lots of rings.  I thought the young lad was going to ask to borrow his specs, (that would have been too good) but no they both continued to look and, both needed to get very close to the labels to see them.  A real treat - Julian would have enjoyed himself.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Jul 2005, 00:01</p><p>A couple of nice glimpses from the car yesterday morning: first, as I was stationary at a T-junction, a young guy in working clothes came out of a shop and headed off down the road: tall and quite slim, black hair, black wire frames, and even though I only saw him for a few seconds, and not close up either, I could see a substantial minus Rx. The second was about an hour later, as I drove down the High Street, a tall fair guy walking up on the opposite side; well dressed, tanned complexion, gold frames, didn't get to see the lenses. He was very handsome - but the myopic working boy was more exciting!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Jul 2005, 02:46</p><p>Don't know how I've managed not to write this one up before. Last Saturday week I was in London, attending a meeting that took most of the day. It was a busy day - Wimbledon, cricket at Lord's and of course the Live8 concert in Hyde Park. I had to do some chauffeuring as well, which involved passing Lord's four times, and the traffic was heavy in the morning. Among the police controlling the crowds on my first journey I caught sight of a thin constable with a pale complexion and dark wire oblong glasses; minus Rx I expect though honestly I didn't get to see the lenses. No sign of him on subsequent trips ::( </p><p>Better still, at the lunch break I was seated near a devastatingly handsome AND very pleasant young guy, Indian colouring mixed ancestry I gather. There was a pair of glasses on the table in front of him, and I thought I'd caught sight of him in glasses earlier on. After lunch he put his glasses on - ah! Very stylish black frames, a bit heavy for wire but light for plastic - carbon fibre maybe? </p><p>My first impression was of a low plus Rx but a second glance made it clear they were low minus. Super sighting, especially as he was such a nice guy. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2005, 17:29</p><p>"...a year or three" - I went rooting through my archives and the sighting of the squinting barman was in January 2000. I wrote it up on the old BBS in a thread called 'More sexy spexy guys'!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2005, 16:46</p><p>Having a bar snack and a pint in the hotel bar in Chester this evening - the barmen wear white shirt and black tie (bow tie that is) and in cold weather black waistcoats as well. None of them bad-looking but one stood out - because he wore glasses, of course. He wasn't a raving beauty though he had a nice smile; tall, maybe 6'2", with pale complexion and dark hair. Dark wire ovals, not too small, with a minus Rx - and that wasn't too small either ::) Thought back to a lunch in another pub in Chester a year or three back when the barman gave a fierce squint every time he looked at anything the other side of the bar - that was SO distracting!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2005, 08:41</p><p>Hi together </p><p> </p><p>Today in a big shopping store I saw 2 youngsters, sure that they was brothers, because very similar, one of them about 16 .. 17, the other 1 ..2 year older. Both of them very handsome with brown hair and deepbrown eyes and of course glasses. Both minus, the older about - 5 and the younger around 3 sph. The older wear a brown, oval plastic frame and the younger a metalblue, also oval wireframe, however he wear his glasses down on his nose and allway he put back the glasses upstairs to his nose. I liked to adjusting his glasses ... only in my dreams. </p><p> </p><p>Many greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2005, 02:22</p><p>Shopping in ASDA the other day, two young slim guys with fair hair - brothers? flatmates? a gay couple - who knows? One of them particularly cute in oblong rimless specs with a low minus Rx. I made sure I had all the packet soup i needed...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2005, 10:19</p><p>Another of those passing glimpses. As I went to join the queue in the doctor's waiting-room this morning there was a stocky, dark guy just coming away from seeing a doctor. He was wearing glasses with very definitely oblong black wire frames; in passing I saw a substantial minus Rx. End of story. </p><p>It's a long time since I mentioned the lad up the street I call 'Philip', who used to wear strong plus specs. I've seen him quite frequently in the last few weeks, driving a pretty new car (MG - last year's model), and never wearing glasses any more. Contacts, I guess - but his last specs didn't suit him and he looks better without them. I never expected to say that about anybody!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2005, 06:17</p><p>I was in London yesterday, and had a long bus journey, not without its compensations ::) There was a fair youth in a white fleece, with very round white wire frames and a low minus Rx...just after that a slim black guy in a smart business suit - black wire frames and not-so-low minus lenses...at a bus stop (he didn't board our bus) a tough-looking weatherbeaten guy with wire frames and a VERY, VERY high minus Rx: plano fronts, power rings galore and lots of cut-in. </p><p>Finally, walking along a street near Euston, a tall youth with fair hair and tanned complexion; shorts, muscular calves and size 12 feet in flip-flops, also tanned. He really doesn't belong here at all because he wasn't wearing glasses, but what the hell, he was gorgeous and there ARE other things than glasses though I don't often admit it. In any case he might have had contacts in, or had his glasses in his backpack - and if all else fails he'll be presbyopic in another quarter-century ::)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>T2</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2005, 11:19</p><p>Hi, Julian, I hope you won't mind this.  I had to be in London at the weekend and had to wait a long time on a tube station.  Near me were two mothers with various kids, the eldest was a boy of about 16 and very short-sighted with round,gold-rimmed glasses which kept slipping down his nose.  He did nothing except keep up his conversation with all and sundry and simply peered at the others over the tops of his specs.  The point of this is to tell you that every now and again, his MOTHER would take hold of the arm of his specs and shift them back into place!!!  Amazing or what? </p><p>We had a longish wait and she did this about four times - while the lazy lad just let her.  When my train arrived they got on as well and the whole thing simply carried on again.  Not once did he move a muscle to help himself. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2005, 07:31</p><p>A glimpse, and a super sighting: Yesterday, a glorious hot summer afternoon, I was driving up the road (as usual with my eyes open and my glasses clean) when a youngish guy passed me, running in the opposite direction, wearing running shoes, shorts, and nothing else except his glasses. He had close cropped fair hair, a trim figure and a golden tan, and was a lovely sight altogether. His frames were squarish wire, gold I thought, and although I couldn't get any idea of his Rx I've decided he was a myope. </p><p>Later in the evening, at a meeting, I found myself sitting next to a cute guy in, probably, his thirties: straight fair hair, cut quite short, fair complexion, biggish nose, nice smile that revealed rather uneven teeth, casual clothes, and very interesting glasses: brown wire (like mine) oval (unlike mine) with a LOT of cylinder in the lenses; as I observed I could see the power (which I think was minus) was all on the horizontal axis.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2005, 01:47</p><p>At a wedding yesterday: nearly every young guy in the place was wearing glasses, including the bridegroom (but not the best man). The array of wire frames and semi-rimless was too much for a white woman. The majority of them seemed to be myopes too. I suppose a genetic tendency could account for it on his side, but it was on both sides (mind you, she had contacts in, so who knows?)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2005, 23:26</p><p>Visited two pubs last night; one for a meal and the other for a drink with friends. In the first there was a group of guys and girls, not necessarily paired off. One of the guys, who moved about the room several times, was medium to tall with short dark hair and an attempt at a beard, jeans, white polo shirt and white trainers. Oval wire frames, gold I think, with a minus Rx. Nice to look at! In the other a group of guys came in and were standing by the bar with their drinks. I could see one was wearing glasses, but my view was blocked by the fruit machine. When I got up to go I had to pass through the group, and he stepped back and smiled, so I got a glance and no more at him. In his twenties, tall, fresh complexion, white trainers (again!) and the most beautiful glasses: black rimless or maybe semi-rimless. Couldn't get a proper look at his Rx, but the effect was quite lovely!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 May 2005, 07:26</p><p>There's a couple who attend our church regularly and have a son in his late teens who comes with them occasionally. He was with them for the Corpus Christi Mass, wearing glasses for the first time, that I've seen anyway. He's a lad of medium height, fairish hair, fresh complexion. His specs are semi-rimless, dark wire, with a minus Rx; not a negligible one either. He took them off for a while during the sermon but put them on again after. Very distractingand strange low these little optical accessories (a John Hegley phrase) transform an otherwise uninteresting youth into, well, an object of interest anyway!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 May 2005, 17:40</p><p>Driving toward the city centre yesterday I saw: first, just about to cross the street, a tallish thin guy with a narrow jaw, in an anorak and wooly hat, biggish round black specs which suited him a treat (no idea of the Rx); about a minute later, an Asian guy (Pakistani in all probability) waiting at a bus stopdark suit, black wire frames, squared-off oval, with a strong minus Rx. Then in a bank I was waiting to be served when a good-looking guy came round the side of the hall in shirt sleeves. I thought at first he was staff, but he joined the queue and I observed his glasses with interest: rimless, left lens definitely plus, right plus but with a lot more cylinder. When I finished my business he was standing at the next window without his glasses; as I watched the teller handed them to him and he put them back on. I've been amusing myself with possible scenarios...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 May 2005, 07:58</p><p>Another sighting of the lovely David whom I mentioned a couple of weeks ago. Went into the pub for a pint after lunch, and he was serving behind the bar. No glasses; no hint of a squint or of any trouble seeing, so maybe he's right when he says he doesn't need them indoors.Funny; I was reckoning his Rx was in the region of -2, and I'd have expected him to be a bit more dependent.  </p><p>Just remembering another barman in another pub a few years ago who gave a great squint every time he looked across the room.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 May 2005, 04:59</p><p>At a wedding last Saturday, the reception was an OO's paradise: a fair few guy in minus glasses, but a few more interesting plusses...a young guy I know who's worn plus specs on and off as long as I've known him, seems to have graduated to full time wear; quite nice semi-rimless, and a stronger Rx, I'm sure, than in the past...a slightly older guy, not unattractive but nothing special, but interest added by black wire frames with a s-t-r-o-n-g plus Rx; I guess he'd have real trouble seeing without them...finally a couple of young kids, identical twins but one had long hair and one short, and both had dark blue wire frames with real pebble lenses in them - but both of them looked over them rather than through them quite a lot (not uncommon, that). They reminded me strongly of another pair of identical twins with stong plus specs that I sometimes see in the pub with their family, younger than the ones at the wedding but otherwise very much alike. Entirely off-topic, but interesting (to me anyway): somebody told me that these (at the wedding) as little kids spoke their own private language. Instead of, or as well as, English. Wow!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Apr 2005, 00:32</p><p>'Everything comes to him who waits' - I said this in January last year after I just once saw a young man I know (called David) wearing glasses. I see him around, usually in the pub, but never again in glasses till last night. He is tall and slim, with a high colour, brown eyes and black hair. Sometimes a goatee beard but last night he seemed to be cultivating designer stubble which I like. Good teeth and a lovely smile. Anyway, last night in the pub he was wearing them again - black wire ovals, perfect for him, with a low minus Rx. I had to have a word with him about something else and said casually, "You don't usually wear glasses, do you?" "When I remember", was the reply. "If I put them down I can't find them. They're just for distance. I don't need them in the pub." "Oh well," I said, they look good on you." A possible scenario is that he wears them to drive to the pub but usually leaves them in the car, but for once had forgotten to take them off. Hope I didn't embarrass him; he's a lovely lad, and I don't just mean his looks, though those are spectacular with or wothout specs!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;25 Apr 2005, 00:03</p><p>A ring on the doorbell at seven the other morningI had showered and was wearing my jockey shorts and one sock. I threw on a bathrobe, found my keys, and answered the door to a postman delivering a packet. He wasn't any kind of raving beauty (short with black hair and maybe moustache) but his glasses were interesting enough to make a note of: brown wire frames and a low minus Rx...I guess I saw him for 30 seconds at the most.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Apr 2005, 20:25</p><p>I think he has got a new pair that don't stand out as much as the previous ones. By the way this topic is also being discussed on 'Guys in glasses'.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2005, 08:49</p><p>On a train journey the other day I sat opposite a tall slim guy with glasses - the table was fitted with power sockets and we were both using laptops. He had medium hair, brown eyes and a fairly high colour. Quite a narrow face, but his glasses were quite wide oblongs in brown wire with a respectable minus Rx (-4? -5?). He made and received several calls on his mobile, and then asked if I'd keep an eye on his stuff while he went to the shop. When he arrived back with his snack I asked him to do the same. We discussed what we were eating and then got into a wide-ranging conversation that lasted the rest of the journey; neither of us got much work done! Shortly before we reached London he took his glasses off and cleaned them. I plucked up my courage and when he put them back on I said, "I say, I think those glasses really suit you." He was pleased, and told me it takes him weeks of browsing round the shops to choose a pair. </p><p>I very seldom comment to a stranger on his glasses; but I've never known anyone not welcome a compliment...I suppose I'm afraid of revealing my optical obsession.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>VisitBoy</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2005, 05:14</p><p>I know that feeling, Julian. It's such a shame when a guy wears the wrong frames.... Even worse than wearing contacts!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2005, 16:49</p><p>I see it's six months since I mentioned 'Philip', the hyperopic kid up the street here. I've hardly seen him in that time, and wondered if he'd moved away, but I have seen him hanging round the corner a couple of times recently. He never wears glasses now, and I guess he must be in contacts. I shudder to say this, but he looks better now than he did with the rather badly chosen frames he was wearing before.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2005, 16:42</p><p>Well, exactly, Julian, will (s)he do it? </p><p>I'll be interested to know if others have been along this route and what their choices were.  We seem to have a family history of cataracts so there are relatives (all wearing low Rx varifocals over implants)I can ask but I'm nervous about raising the subject. </p><p>If my diagnosis is right and if I were to end up with say +9, it's not all that high (nowhere near lenticular)and I think I could live with higher than that. </p><p>It's not the onset of prespyopia because I've had an add of (I think) +1.5 (must check!)for a few years now and it doesn't seem to be getting worse. I don't seem to have trouble with focussing, just seem to need more light. But I suppose as the eye ages it becomes less transparent so it may be old age! </p><p>My forthcoming eye-test should tell me.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2005, 16:11</p><p>...or even a narrow field of vision.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2005, 16:10</p><p>Lentifan: what you are experiencing could just be the onset of presbyopia, not cataract. Is reading easier without your glasses, or are you having the problem reading bareyed?  </p><p>I wouldn't care to have cataract surgery and *no* lens implant. I remember the 'cataract glasses' of a generation agousually high plus lenticulars (which I know you like!) with a narrow fiend of vision. Presumably a surgeon CAN put in the lens that will give you any degree of myopia or hyperopia. The question is WILL (s)he?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2005, 15:34</p><p>Julian and Filthy, </p><p>I have been thinking for a while now that cataract surgery might be my only plausible route to a more significant Rx than my current -2. I've recently begun to notice I don't see so well in dim light and need to have a brighter light for reading so have booked an eye-test.  I'm wondering if the onset gas started. </p><p>I read somewhere that the average post-cataract Rx was +11.  Does anyone know if you add/subtract your existing Rx from this, so that the most likely result for me would be +9?  I gather the standard treatment nowadays is a lens implant; does anyone know if you can refuse this (I'm talking UK NHS here;presumably if you go private they do what you want)?  Or how much choice you get as to your post-implant Rx? </p><p>Sorry if I'm in the wrong thread here.  I just wanted to link in to your discussion?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2005, 13:08</p><p>Since presbyopia results from the loss of flexibility in the crystalline lens, it seems intuitively correct that going without glasses will cause the lens to flex more, and may delay onsent, much like stirring Jell-O during the setting process.  I have yet to be proven right, however, and would welcome any information that proves I am wasting my time with this eyestrain thing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2005, 12:36</p><p>Gosh Filthy, you're quite a bit more hyperopic than I am (but I have a bit more astigmatism). Does going without glasses really delay the onset of presbyopia? I'd have thought it would just cause eyestrain. As I said on the other thread, I sympathize with you about wanting to see close without glassesbut I'd only opt for myopia if I needed cataract surgery sometime. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2005, 08:50</p><p>Julian, some time ago you poted to some thread about my Rx - I have only remembered to answer you now.  It's presently +2.25 -0.5 axis 137 OR, +1.75 -0.25 axis 47 OS.  The astigmatism on the left eye is commonly missed in eye exams, although it may not be "missed" so much as it is variable, as the axis has shifted from time to time as well. </p><p> </p><p>Sin of sins (on this board), I attempt to wear glasses as seldom as possible so that the onset of presbyopia is slowed.  Once I am fully hit by it, I'm probably looking into refractive surgery, provided that advances in technology in the next few years render the results more predictable.  I like the idea of corneal rings and being about a -3 or -4 so I can read without glasses.  We'll see how that goes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2005, 19:12</p><p>A few glorious glimpses in the last few days.  </p><p>Thursday: at the staion, getting tickets for my next few train journeys, when a stream of passengers came off a train from the south. The most interesting of the spexy guys was tall with sallow complexion and black hairand black frames and tinted lenses. Can't tell you any more, it was only a glimpse. </p><p>Friday: shopping in ASDA. Two big burly guys walked briskly past, one of them unshaven, silver frames with black temples, strong minus lenses. (there seem to be a lot of black and silver frames around these days, I've noticed them and jotted them a few times lately...a possibility for my nex pair, I wonder? </p><p>Saturday, in the pub: tall pale-faced guy in a Manchester United shirt (bright red): semi-rimless in heavyish brown plastic, minus. In the same group a slightly older guy with a pair of wire-framed glasses hanging from the neck of his polo shirt. Never got to see the lenses, but when he came back from buying a round at the bar he was just taking them off and garaging them again. Also in the pub a tall guy (whom I took at first for someone else)black hair and beard, dressed in black, black wire frames, strong enough minus to show power rings. </p><p>Last, but not least, Sunday, leaving another pub where I'd had lunch (delicious roast lamb!): there were two lads of about 18 playing the fruit machine. One of them was wearing glasses, so naturally I looked. He looked back, smiled and gave me the standard friendly greeting: "Awright?" I responded in kind, knowing his face was familiar, if a bit spotty for the moment. When he gets rid of the acne he will be a real raver: about six foot two, slim and fair. White slacks, white football shirt, white baseball cap. Black plastic frames, tinted lenses, minus. Don't know where I know him from, though he could easily have been a kid in the school where I go as a governor,  a foot shorter, with or without glasseswhich he has the sense to make a feature of as he can't see without them. Full marks for presentation!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2005, 23:20</p><p>An encounter yesterday with another family: father, mother, daughter, son and his partner, and baby. As they came towards me, all smiling (which was nice for a start) I thought of a phrase in one of Margery Allingham's books, 'the most aggressively legitimate son Mr Campion had ever seen'. The father was taller, but they had similar colouring (fair hair, blue eyes), similar features, and especially the identical smileit was quite spooky. The son also had dimples and, yes, glasses: rimless with a low minus Rx. he quite made my day.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2005, 16:50</p><p>If your asking abut my post of 15 March, I was guessing on thebasis of what little cut-in I could see.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Marlian</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2005, 10:23</p><p>Julian, </p><p>How can you tell with the smaller frames what an approximately prescription the glasses are. If you can't see cut-in or from behind?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2005, 11:56</p><p>Reporting back on yesterday's wedding (see my previous post). </p><p>1. The myopic bridegroom was neither wearing glasses nor squinting; I deduce he had contacts in (he wasn't  obviously blinking a lot either). </p><p>2. The bride's hyperopic brother, who was giving her away, was wearing his thick pebble glasses. They're photochromic too. </p><p>3. This interested me: the pageboy, aged I suppose about 8 or 10, was also wearing strong plus glasses at the weddingwhich he wasn't when I was with them earlier in the week. I guess he's a young brother or maybe nephew of the bride. So maybe there's a gene for hyperopia in the family. But is he a new weareror what? </p><p>4. In the crowd, a good looking young guy with well-chosen rimless or maybe semi-rimless specs...a lad in his teens with very wide wire frames and lenses, not strong, with a marked yellow tint.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2005, 04:30</p><p>Another good day for sightings yesterday... </p><p>A glimpse from the car in the morning: as I was driving up a not-very-wide street there were cars coming in the opposite direction and passing required a bit of give-and-take. One of the cars that passed me was driven by a delicious youth with a short dark beard, not much more than designer stubble really, a black baseball cap and glasses with black wire frames - couldn't be sure if they were semi-rimless or all round - and low plus lenses. </p><p>Later in the day I was in a group that included a guy, nothing spectacular about his looks, brown hair and freckles, but the most beautiful pair of specs: black frames, not too heavy, almost straight Oakley-ish earpieces. Minus lenses, maybe with cylinder. </p><p>Then in the evening I was with a young couple whose wedding I'm going to on Saturday and their family and friends. The bridegroom-to-be, a big dark guy with a line of beard all round his jaw and a lively snes of humour, wore gold semi-rimless specs, with the wire rim under the lenses instead of above them, and a high nosepiece. They looked as if they were designed as half-eye readers, but they were adjusted close up to his eyes, and the lenses were minus, and not to be sneezed at either. Difficult to judge because they were so close to his eyes but my guess would be -3 to -4. Then the bride's brother, a lively, pleasant youth,  but nothing special to look at if he hadn't worn glasses: kind of Harry Potter-ish but oval rather than round, and (another one for you, Lentifan) strong plus lenses, real pebbles, comparable to the ones I wrote about last week. It'll be interesting to see if these guys wear glasses on the wedding day. I'd say it's that or contacts, as they'd have some trouble getting around bareyed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2005, 16:44</p><p>Julian </p><p>Sorry for getting that wrong.  Wishful thiking, maybe.  Anyway, even high plus is a bit of a treat these days, eh?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2005, 23:35</p><p>Some interesting sightings... </p><p>Thursday night in the non-smoking room of a busy local pub: a heavily-built guy whom I've seen there before - might be a biker - with high colour and pepper-and-salt hair and beard; gold aviators, maybe -5, frames too big for his face; a big floppy-looking youth with dark wire frames and a very low minus Rx - specs would have looked OK if his face hadn't been so boring; a guy in his forties with short fairish hair, receding hairline, rimless ovals, minus, sitting too far away from his face and looking OK from some angles but just wrong from others; in the same group a taller guy with longer hair, greying a bit, semi-rimless, low minus, correctly adjusted, looking superb; me, low plus, bronze wire. As I list them I just wonder if any of them was looking at my glasses and deciding they suited me - or didn't ::) </p><p>Better selection of spexy guys when I went to the station yesterday to get my train ticket for the next London trip: ahead of me in the queue, a thin youth with a girl and a push-chair, pale face, dark hair, dark wire ovals, low minus and maybe cylinder - superb; behind him an Asian guy with black and silver semi-rimless, moderate minus - good; the clerk was a tall guy with what little hair he has shaved, black wire ovals, low plus - OK. As I left the station, a tall fair youth with brown eyes and *white* wire ovals, low minus - glanced his way and our eyes met for a second and my insides turned a somersault; finally, crossing the road to the car, a casually dressed guy in strong minus specs, walking briskly away - never got to see him properly ::(</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2005, 18:07</p><p>Lentifan: you misunderstood me. The guy I saw wasn't wearing lenticulars, just strong plus 'pebbles'.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2005, 13:37</p><p>Re: 'Pebble' lenses </p><p>I think Julian uses the term correctly when he refers to very high plus lenses, particularly lenticulars.  According to my dictionary, the term originally applied to lenses actually made from rock-crystal and now more generally covers any thick convex lens. </p><p>However, I suspect the public generally would use the term to cover myodiscs which, before blended and high-index lenses, used to look 'pebbly'. </p><p>Julian's sighting of the young man with lenticulars is quite remarkable, though.  They are very rare nowadays, and in my experience almost confined to old people.  I did once see a young boy of about 8 a few years ago.  He left the pathway and started to climb over some rocks, stumbling to the obvious concern of the elderly couple (grandparents?)he was with.  He seemed to have fairly poor vision. </p><p>Also some time ago a thirtyish woman in a supermarket who seemed to have no obvious problem with her vision. </p><p>Women wearing lenticulars have had a fascination for me as long as I can remember.</p><p></p><hr>

Also in plus lenses, some of them pretty strong, were another son, a daughter, and several younger members of the family. Not a minus lens to be seen!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2005, 08:51</p><p>Two recent visits to (different branches of) Tesco to pick up a few odds and ends: Saturday night, towards closing time, there was a tall, thin young man in a yellow fluorescent jacket sorting trolleys and baskets. He had dark hair, what might have been either the beginnings of a beard or (preferably) designer stubble, and oblong dark wire frames with a minus Rx, not very strong. And there was just a little camp something about his gestures.

In Sainsburys, one customer, slim, neat guy with smart (shiny, maybe new) oblong wire frames with a moderate minus Rx. A one point he took them off, squinted at the lenses from about eight inches, and put them back on. The, on the patisserie counter, a bonde assistant in white coat, straw hat and gold semi-rimless with around -3 and cylinder. Finally at a checkout, an Asian youth being shown how to do the job; he was quite tall with wavy hair. Really strong minus lenses in a black and silver frame. </p><p>ASDA was much tamer, but there was another young man like the one I mentioned the other day, waring his plus glasses on top of his head, where the dark hair was close-cropped. </p><p>In between I called at the filling station where, for the first time since new year's day, I found the handsme and highly myopic Asian guy on duty. Chatted briefly - he's a part-time accountance student - and noticed to my disappointment that his fingernails are ill-kept and bitten. That's usually a major turn-off but I'll make an exception in his case.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2005, 17:57</p><p>Last night at a social gathering for members of local churches, the bar staff were an uninteresting lot, even if they hadn't been female, with one exception, a young guy. He wasn't fat but he was very solidly built; short medium-to-fair hair, tuft of a goatee beard, clear complexion; slacks and  a blue short-sleeved shirt. Not quite round metal frames with fancy temples and a strong minus Rx - at first glance my guess was around -8; he came round a few times collecting glasses - the kind people had had a drink out of::) - but he was never still long enough to get a proper look, Nice eye candy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2005, 14:46</p><p>Thanks Steph - my pleasure! </p><p>Another jotting from another train journey...the other day I had a particularly awkward journey home from the south: four trains! on the third one I travelled from Reading to Birmingham, and at Oxford a lad of about 18 got on. We chatted a bit and then I went back to my laptop and he took out a book of crosswords - but he kept getting stuck and I kept interfering with answers. He seemed a really pleasant youth, besides being quite good looking: a little over 6 feet I guess, and quite slim; hair medium to fair, clear complexion with just a trace of acne. Excellent taste in glasses - they were semi-rimless, brown plastic, not at all heavy; really becoming. Low minus Rx.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Steph</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2005, 06:37</p><p>Hi Julian, </p><p>I'm Maltese and enjoyed your jottings about Malta. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2005, 00:27</p><p>(Sorry, I pressed the wrong key!) </p><p>Last jotting about the Malta trip. One the train back from Birmingham International, daigoally opposite me was a tall slim student-looking guy who was working at some papers. He got off at Wolverhampton. He wore minus lenses in black wire frames, but the fronts of the frames were a lot more curved (?) than usual, so that the specs follwed the line of his face much more closely than usual. Quite nice, anyway. Facing him, from Birmingham New Street, a young guy with a girl. Medium height, medium hair (both length and colour), reddish wire frames, around -4 or -5 so I suppose you might call that medium myopia too. Hearing aid (behind the ear type) on his left side (couldn't see his right). He and the girl were conversing in sign language with a bit of lip reading, and laughing and joking with someone else a few seats away, all in total silence. I think my reaction was admiration. They got off at Wolverhampton too, and the rest of the journey was without interest - of our kind anyway.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2005, 00:15</p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2005, 16:21</p><p>Interesting one at the checkout at ASDA this evening: young couple with a trolley full of goods. The guy (medium height, short black hair, pale complexion, pleasant smile as he spoke to the cashier, quite cute really) had a smart pair of semi-rimless glasses in his hair. The Rx was plus. Why would he be doing that? he was too young to be a presbyope (30 at the most) but if he was ahyperope I'd expect him to be comfortable with his glasses properly on. Unless he's a new wearer who hasn't learned to see distances with them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2005, 03:39</p><p>Clare: I love Valletta. Special favourite spots are St Paul's Shipwreck church (the 'hidden gem') and the Caffè Cordina in Republic Street - the building was part of the Knights' Treasury, but I like to sit outside and watch the world go by (especially, would you believe, the spexy guys!). </p><p>Now for the absolute five-star sighting of the whole week. On the Monday of our stay we took the longish trip to Mdina, the Silent City. As we boarded the bus I noticed the driver's profile: black hair, swarthy complexion, two or three days' growth of beard - and glasses! Beautiful shiny new glasses, wire ovals in black and silver; plus lenses; and I had plenty of time to observe them. I was sitting about ten feet behind him, and as he looked to right and left I was able to see that they were strong enough to invert the distant view - but it was also skewed, so I reckoned there was astigmatism there as well as hyperopia. An occasional glimpse at his reflection in his rear view mirror showed deep frown lines, which made me wonder if his glasses were not only new but also his first - if maybe he'd needed them for a long time but only recently got them. As we left the bus I got a look at him full face - really handsome, and the lenses definitely magnified his brown eyes. When the time came for the return journey I wondered what our chances were of the same bus and the same driver - but you don't win the lottery twice!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2005, 11:18</p><p>Julian - is Valetta still glorious? It was a couple of years ago when I was there, and I hear they're redeveloping the old harbourside quarter that was formerly the home of the Royal Navy. Love it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2005, 02:28</p><p>Another gneral observation from Malta. From my seat at the back of the bus into Valletta one morning I could see twelve people wearing glasses, all British, none young - and not a minus lens among them. Oh, and myself made thirteen. As I got off at the Valletta bus station I did see one elderly man with strong minus specs - my view of him had been obscured before. But who says there are more myopes than hyperopes around? </p><p>Valletta bus station has to be at least one of the most magnificent in the world. It's circular, just outside the city gate, and has a superb fountain in the middle (You understand it wasn't allways a bus station!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2005, 02:19</p><p>As promised: the morning before we left I noticed at breakfast a tall guy with close-cropped dark hair, dressed in black (fleece, tracksuit bottoms, and boots) and what looked like small oval glasses. He was sitting on his own and didn't seem to be looking up or speaking to anyone. Later in the day he and I arrived at the lift together and it turned out we were going to the same floor. This time he was in a red sweatshirt. He turned out to be very friendly and chatty, with a bright smile. he told me he was on holiday alone. We finished our conversation on the landing and I was able to observe his glasses, which were not oval but diamond-shaped; lenses strong enough minus to show power rings and minification even though they were very small. The next morning he was at breakfast again, looking morose and withdrawn. As I passed his table I gave him a 'Good morning' and once again got the beaming smile; we exchanged a few words and I went on my way. </p><p>I've never seen glasses that shape before. I thught they looked remarkably camp for a guy who was fairly butch in other respects. Did wonder if he was gay, but I suppose I'll never know.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2005, 07:03</p><p>In the hotel: there were one or two spexy guys on the staff, but the only really exciting one was a waiter who appeared in the dining room the morning we were leaving. The uniform is yellow shirt, black bow tie, black pants and long black apron, and this guy (being Maltese) had a Mediterranean complexion and black hair cut short (and well cut at that). His eyes were hazel rather than dark brown, and he wore black framed glasses - couldn't be sure whether they were heavyish metal or light plastic; or they could have been carbon fibre I suppose. Minus lenses, not too strong. Anyway he raised the whole tone of the dining room! </p><p>An awful lot of the guests were elderly people spending a chunk of winter in a warmer climate (that was the idea anyway) but I did spot quite a cute guy one evening: pale complexion, black hair and brown eyes. White metal frames, almost round, lots of power rings. One morning at breakfast a slim youth in a smart grey suit, blue shirt and tie (but not shaved). Heavy brown plastic frames, plus with a bit of cylinder. A lovely sight. One more that I'll leave for my next post.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2005, 01:35</p><p>During a week in Malta I took copious notes for jottings; now, after a week back home I'm wondering how many of them are worth transcribing! Three general impressions though: </p><p>1. A lot of nice young men who don't have (or at least don't wear) the glasses they need. One that struck me particularly was a tall slim guy with curly black hair who was waiting in the bus queue and got on the same bus we did: jeans, checked shirt, bodywarmer (for the med it was cold!). Heavy-lidded eyes in, it seemed, a permanent squint. Another, quite unmistakeably myopic, waiting at the stop as our bus drew up, and gave a ferocious squint to see the numner on the following bus before boarding ours. </p><p>2. Quite a few big butch guys with really strong minus Rx, usually made up (it seemed ) in wire ovals. One in particular, well-built but vulnerable-looking as if ne needed even stronger lenses then he was wearing. </p><p>3. A Sunday afternoon stroll along the seafront evealed a good supply of young men with nutbrown complexions and rimless specs with low minus lenses. That combination workes well. </p><p>I was with two friends, both of who wear plus specs (as I do). But for them they're just things you need to see properly. What they miss! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2005, 09:56</p><p>Just a glimpse from the car as I drove down the High Street this afternoon. Two tall guys, well-dressed in dark clothes, walking up in the opposite direction; it crossed my mind they might possibly be Mormon missionaries. Be that as it may, one of them wore gold ovals with a respectable minus Rx which quite made my day. </p><p>By the way, if anyone cares, I'm hoping to send a couple of new stories to Izzy in the very near future. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2005, 13:49</p><p>Julian - yes please do. The Will Shakespeare stories were my favourite though.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2005, 07:07</p><p>I didn't send that one - was it meant for me? I ran out of steam on Hana May and Asher, or rather Asher, 'cos somebody else wrte the Hana May bit, and of course it was deleted with the other fiction and so far hasn't been posted anywhere else...most of my stuff has gone to Izzy's Yahoo group,'gayglassesfetishfiction' but Hana May and Asher don't fit in there. I still have it stored and might write some more some day. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Jan 2005, 15:47</p><p>What ever happened to Hana May and Asher?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2005, 03:39</p><p>Hi Cheston; yes, I do, progressives. Can't actually find my latest script, but the previous one 18 months ago is: Right, +1.50-1.00x10; Left +0.75-0.25x20. Add +2.00. Variations from year to year are insignificant and I haven't had new glasses since 2000. Time for a new pair after my next test, I think. I wear them full time and have done since I was 28; before that I wore them part time for ten years. Well, you asked... </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cheston</b>&nbsp;05 Jan 2005, 09:04</p><p>Julian, </p><p>Do you wear glasses? If so, what is your script?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Jan 2005, 00:38</p><p>Interesting pair of specs in ASDA yesterday - more interesting than the guy who was wearing them actually...short brown hair, slightly sculptured features and quite a high colour in his cheeks; in any case he was buying baby food so was probably straight. Anyway, his specs: black oval wire frames with a high joint, sitting well away from his eyes. More cylinder than sphere in the lenses, so that they were minus in one meridian and plus in the other. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2005, 23:08</p><p>Looked in at the same filling station yesterday, just to get a newspaper, and the same handsome spexy guy was on duty. After a second look I think I might have underestimated his Rx - cut-in and power rings are very marked. Must be high index lenses though; they aren't thick. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;01 Jan 2005, 06:56</p><p>Happy new year, everybody! </p><p>The other day somebody used the phrase 'cute young Paki boy in wire rims' - well! I stopped at the filling station yesterday to make sure I had fuel for the weekend and the guy on the checkout filled the bill: he was certainly Asian, but a lot chattier than the average Pakistanis, so I wondered if he was Indian or Afrfican-Asian; he was cute - darker complexion than some, clear skin, nice hair, neat figure; the wire rims were black and quite small, more or less oval, and the minus lenses in them were s-t-r-o-n-g, my guess would be -6 or maybe as much as -8. A nice sighting to end the year with! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2004, 02:47</p><p>Thursday evening is ringing practice at church, and I often find a group of the ringers in my local later on. Last night there was a young guy in the group whom I didn't immediately recognize - tall, well-built, dark hair, pale complexion, not shaved recently (designer stubble? not shaving for the holidays? who knows?) It was only when I saw him smile that it suddenly clicked - he was the son of one of the other ringers. Must be about seven years since I saw him, and then he was slim, not to say slight in build. He has definitely filled out - not that he's fat, but broader all round. The other difference was the glasses. A few years ago they went on to drive and disappeared into his pocket as he switched the engine off. Now he was wearing them for such visually demanding activities as drinking a pint. And they are not all that strong - no more than -2 I'd say. Interesting in view of all the discussion about how myopic one can get without being a full-time wearer; obviously some people just like to see clearly... </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eustace</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2004, 13:30</p><p> </p><p>Brian-16, Hi,again. </p><p> </p><p>I continue: </p><p> </p><p>I recall your posting of some time ago describing how you and your friend shower together, both wearing your glasses.  Frankly, I think that is such a turn-on; and I keep trying to visualize the two of you. And it causes me to want to know a little bit more about you:  Would you mind describing yourself and your friend--like how tall are each of you, how much do you each weigh, what is the color of your hair and eyes, and how long is your hair? And how often do the two of you sleep over at each other's homes?  If all of this is too embarrassing or too personal, just say so.  (Or if you would prefer to send me an e-mail, my address is eneely@optonline.net. ) </p><p> </p><p>Happy New Year! </p><p> </p><p>Eustace</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eustace</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2004, 13:20</p><p> </p><p>Brian-16: </p><p> </p><p>I hope that you are having a good holiday!  I had planned to spend Christmas with friends in South Orange, NJ; but on the morning of Christmas Eve my back "went out" and I cancelled my plans--as I was afraid that the drive from Long Island to NJ would reall do my back in.  So, I went to a Christmas Even church service and otherwise had a solitary Christmas at home.  (My partner is in western Pennsylvania for a week spending the holidays with his parents.)  But it was OK, as I am something of a Scrooge about Christmas.  I just find it all so dreadfully commercialized and wearying -- with so much shopping,so many parties, etc. </p><p> </p><p>Anway, today I am catching up on scanning some Eyescene postings and came across yours of October 12.  I always enjoy reading your postings; and I was especially happy to learn that you have had a boy friend for some time now--and that your parents are supportive.  That is great! </p><p> </p><p>I'm afraid that I tend to be somewhat verbose and am probably coming close to the 600 word limit on postings.  So, I will contine this in another positing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;25 Dec 2004, 15:07</p><p>Out to Christmas dinner in a big pub/steakhouse just up the road here (I had roast duck). Toward the end of the meal I discovered that a family party of about eight had come to the next table. Back to back with me, and sitting at the end on his own, was a young guy, quite slim, with short dark hair and sallow complexion with freckles. Not a raging beauty, but a nice pair of specs: black semi-rimless, rather narrow oblongs, with a conspicuously strong minus Rx - when I say that I mean maybe -5 or -6, no more than that. But at a glance it was obvious he'd be pretty blind without them. </p><p>Happy Christ Mass everybody - or if you prefer it Happy Holy Days ::) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2004, 06:58</p><p>there's something rather nice about the kind of sighting where you think, "Hmm, nice looking guy" and then thirty seconds or more later it dawns, "AND he's wearing glasses!" I had one like that today. As I walked up the street there was this tall, lean guy walking briskly down on the other side: blue jeans, donkey jacket, sallow complexion, blonde highlights in his long hair. When he was directly opposite me I realized there was a very unobtrusive pair of specs to complete the picture. Better still: a few minutes later I had got into the car and was coming out of the car park when he passed right in front of me on the way back up, and I could see that the glasses were rimless with lenses around -2. A lovely sight on a winter's day. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2004, 12:48</p><p>Nice sighting earlier on today - just a glimpse from the car though. Tall youngish guy, slim, fair hair thinning a bit the way fair hair often does, pink cheeks, and the most perfect specs for him: oval wire frames, strong minus lenses with a brown tint, or maybe they were reactolite. Anyway he looked good. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2004, 15:58</p><p>Kids mock glasses-wearers all the time.  Of course, kids are pure evil.  They find the least little thing that is different about someone and turn it into a reason to ostracize and persecute.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eric</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2004, 14:55</p><p>Indeed, when I was a kid I thought it was absolutely amazing that nearsighted people seemed to be looking into a universe in which everything was so small... I used to wonder if they saw things very big!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eric</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2004, 14:53</p><p>Interesting that's there no prejudice against myopic people. Imagine if they were mocked for the cut-in of their lenses, or their power rings, to say nothing of the fact that many of them can only see a few inches without correction... </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2004, 06:44</p><p>Why does any word become offensive?  WASP, faggot, nigger, kike, wop.  THey're just words. </p><p> </p><p>Whether a particular term is considered offensive or not has to do with a number of factors.  Usually it has mostly to do with who uses the term, for what purpose, and in what context.  Black people in America call each other "nigger" with a fair degree fo regularity.  Everyone else avoids the term unless they want to get into a fight. </p><p> </p><p>It is also my impression, not backed up by research of any sort, that a word (sometimes a diminutive like "Paki") used with reference to some visible group that is a minority in any given country will often be seen to take on pejorative overtones, particularly if that group is a "target" for animosity from some subset of the dominant group.  Someone here mentioned "Paki bashing"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Adeline</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2004, 18:39</p><p>Puffin: I agree. British or English is much more attractive and respectful. Of course they have a grand bundle of names for us, but I still prefer British.Back in the 60s/70s, PAKI "BASHING"...beating up, was quite a common term (IN UK) for those from Pakistan, and surely there are many, along with others in great numbers who are,actually, destroying the British country that we(I) knew. PITY ! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2004, 18:31</p><p>Talking of "Paki" being a recognized but not particularly complimentary term for "Pakistani", why is the similar contraction "Brit" for "British" so commonly used and why isn't it considered equally offensive? (personally I hate the "word" - such as it is) </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

The actual meaning of the word is 'pure' - Pakistan is the land of the pure, just as Afghanistan is the land of the Afghans. But I must bear that in mind. Thanks, Filthy love. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2004, 17:54</p><p>Jules, old friend, </p><p> </p><p>Is "Paki" not a pejorative term in the UK?  It certainly is in North America.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Nov 2004, 07:03</p><p>A couple of things: first, I had the session with the delicious young guy I mentioned the other day. For one thing his myopia is not as low as I thought at first meeting - maybe as much as -3 I guess; for another he'd shaved since Wednesday but still had a heavy shadow; but finally he was wearing shorts which revealed a nice muscular pair of legs with a thick growth  of black hair ::) </p><p>Secondly, while shoping in Kwik-Save, several sightings of a little Pakistani kid in specs with quite strong plus lenses - an exception to prove my rule that 'Spexy Pakis are myopes'. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Nov 2004, 17:10</p><p>Ages since I reported any sightings! There were several I meant to post a cuple of weeks ago, but I ran out of time. Anyway, I have to break silence to tell you about the guy who came to see me this morning on business: tall and slim, on his way home from work on a night shift, so hadn't shaved - for at least a couple of days I reckon. heavy growth of black hair on his chin, and the black hair on his head cut almost as short; high colour; brown, almost black, eyes - and low minus lenses in black wire frames. A colleague who came in while we were talking said afterwards, "I could see he had your undivided attention!" I have to see him and his wife at their home in a day or two. I hope he isn't the kind of low myope who takes his glasses off when he goes home, but even if he his - and if he's had a shave - he'll still be gorgeous. </p><p>Another one today, nothing like so striking but reasonably attractive. All the time we were talking there was a glasses case beside him but he never opened it, let alone put his specs on, so I'm left wondering what they're like and what he needs them for. I have to see him again in a few days, so he might be wearing them then - but for some reason I have my doubts! Tantalizing... </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2004, 03:21</p><p>A few nice sightings this week: </p><p>Visiting a friend in hospital...guided in by a nice little male nurse with dark hair, camp as a row of army tents, with plastic framed specs - dark laminate on a clear frame - lenses low plus with quite a lot of cylinder. Very pleasant and helpful. </p><p>As I drove down the street another day, one of my Pakistani neighbours was just getting into his car, I've mentioned him before. He's a guy in his thirties I guess, or maybe early forties, fairly light-skinned, with straight floppy black hair that would have been considered long when I was a kid; preppy round wire frames with quite strong lenses - minus of course. He isn't exactly handsome or good-looking, but he is incredibly sexy. </p><p>A bit later, at a filling station, the guy behind me in the queue to pay: young, medium , neat figure, short crisp black hair, sallow complexion with freckles(!), brown eyes. Black wire frames with minus lenses, not thick but strong, maybe -5 or -6. Power rings. Ships that pass in the night... </p><p>Interesting in view of questions on other threads: I've been at a three-day meeting this week where one of the other participants was an elderly guy with executive trifocals. So you can get them in the UK. </p><p>Finally, and at the same meeting, quite a cute boy (well, late thirties): short, a bit thick about the lower part of the body, fresh complexion, black hair beginning to go grey, little goatee beard, brown eyes with long lashes, plus glasses in oval bronze-coloured frames - some of the time. His eyes seemed to me to have a slightly strained look when he wasn't wearing them; at one point he looked at something, not close up at all, and said, "Im just trying to focus". Wanted to suggest he'd be more comfortable if he went full time, but said nothing. What business was it of mine after all? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;12 Oct 2004, 05:32</p><p>Julian-Yes,when I started posting I was 16 years of age and had a boyfriend then.He does wear glasses with bi-focals,but his distance rx is not quite as high as mine.He also is a bookworm.I met him when I was  a freshman in high school and joined the school activities club for gays and lesbians.Its much more open in the U.S. contrary to what may have been reported in the news.Our parents do understand,and thats the best part!I used Brian-16 as I noted there was another Brian on here for a longer period than me.Thanks for asking..</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Oct 2004, 04:11</p><p>Brian: I keep wondering why you post as 'Brian-16' - for a while I thought -16 was your Rx, but I gather you're not as myopic as that. Not yet anyway :;) Is it maybe you age when you atrted posting here? </p><p>Another question: does your boy friend wear glasses? The nice thing about being in a gay relationship is that in all probability you both admire the same guys: many's the time my friend Sandy and I have passed a good looking guy, and all one of us has needed to say is "Knows it too". </p><p>,lkj</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>David_Llewellyn</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2004, 12:03</p><p>JustMe: It is unclear to me what you are asking. Are you asking are blended myodiscs the only option? Certainly your weaker Rx eye (the 12.75) does not require a myodisc. The -20 is right on the border of requiring it. You can probably get a high-index lens which will just cover your Rx and not be a myodisc (for example, the new 1.9 index lenses). These are very pricey! Also I think (altho I am NOT a professional!) that with the difference b/w your eyes, high-index lenses would not be that great. I suspect you would get the best vision with CR-39 myodiscs that you have been wearing, even if they are not as pretty as you would like (although I happen to like them!). The best frames to use would be perfectly round (e.g., a Harry Potter type style)... a mathematical circle, exactly centered on your eye (ignoring the cylinder issue for now)... and, although I like larger frames, for your purposes a small eye-size is probably best. That will minimize the difference in the appearence of the two lenses. </p><p>If you can tolerate this, you can further improve the appearance by asking for the same base curve (front curvature here) in both lenses, and have the difference purely on the back. For example, perhaps a -1.00 or -2 on the front (even plano if possible) and everything else on the back. From the side, the stronger lens will be thicker, no way around that, but from the all-important front, they will look very similar if the front curves are the same.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2004, 02:19</p><p>Yes, Brian, I suppose so. But then I'm pretty easily smitten by anything in specs and trousers, or better still shorts, while as for the kilt... It would be the same if you were hanging around our street, even though I'm old enough to be your grandfather. His too, I guess. But I've more than once reported sightings of 'Philip' in specs, shorts, trainers and nothing else...woowwww!

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Oct 2004, 05:04</p><p>Just seen 'Philip' again, not actually driving his car but standing by it talking to somebody (whose car he may possibly have been jump starting) - no glasses. And I caught a glimpse of him earlier on driving; not certain but couldn't see glasses. So it looks as if the worst has happened. ::( </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 Oct 2004, 13:03</p><p>I'm a bit worried about 'Philip', the hyperopic youth who lives up the street. Twice this week I've seen him out in the street without his glasses.

I shan't go into mourning unless and until I see him driving his car without specs. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;24 Sep 2004, 23:10</p><p>Been to London again this week - three appointments in 48 hours. The week's star sighting was on the train home yesterday: a tall guy with short, straight, fair hair, a black fleece, and glasses that made me think of Buddy Holly, heavy black frames, quite wide, and minus lenses. I saw him board, along with another tall guy with black curly hair and no glasses and a dark-haired girl. We were right at the front of the train and all the seats faced back, and they were a few seats away. When we were well on our way the three of them got up to go, I guess, to the cafeteria, and I thought I might get another full face view when they came back - but we were at my destination. I was laving the train and looking the wrong way when they passed &lt;sob&gt; He was really good looking, and had made a good choice of frames. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;23 Sep 2004, 14:21</p><p>Interesting NZoptic your description of longish blond hair and glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>A general comment - as my hair gets longer (currently have the old Dido cut, kinda layered and straight,and blond) I increasingly feel that my glasses don't look right. I bought them when I had a shortish (behind the ears) cut and felt they looked quite stylish. Now though, it all feels very different. Anyone else come across this, probably mostly female, dilemma?  I love this cut though.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>nzoptic</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2004, 03:07</p><p>At an Art Gallery today (the joy of holidays),security person, early 20's tall thin, long blondish hair, plastic oblong glasses, lovely frames )cheap) on a lovely face: despite my almost indecent attempts could not deduce lenses but think PROBABLY plus (not strong)  Almost engaged him in conversation but refrained.  May return for a further report.  Suspect he is gay, I do hope so!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JustMe</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2004, 13:38</p><p>I have the soft lenses that I have been wearing for years and unfortunately, I have developed an intolerance to them.

If you think of anything else, please let me know.  Thank! </p><p> </p><p>JM</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2004, 07:42</p><p>A nice young man started coming to our church recently: fair hair, clear complexion and always smells of shower gel - he says he gets up at five in the morning to go out running!  </p><p>The other day I spotted him screwing up his eyes to see the page number displayed at the front of church; so when we were chatting yesterday I said, "Tell me something: is your eyesight all right?" He said he hadn't had a test for ages; I explained why I was asking, and he agreed distant objects are a bit blurred. He has no trouble reading, but "couldn't read a number plate at five car lengths." He doesn't drive so that doesn't matter, but who knows? Perhaps he'll be prompted to have a test and get a nice pair of specs that'll make him even better-looking. I'll let you know if he does. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2004, 07:24</p><p>In London yesterday. Lots to see, of course, but the day's star sighting was on a westbound Central Line train which I boarded at Oxford Circus. It was either there or at Bond Street that this young man got on: tall with short curly black hair and semi-rimless specs in black wire. It was hard to see what the lenses were (the view beyond him was pitch dark most of the time) but I had the impression of some cylinder in them. He was wearing a greyish sweatshirt and longish black shorts, which showed tanned, hairy, and above all MUSCULAR legs - another turn-on for Jules! I was enjoying the view so much that I stayed on the train till Notting Hill Gate and walked back to my destination instead of getting off at Queensway (which you might think was appropriate) and walking onward to it. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2004, 07:15</p><p>JustMe: no one seems to have any sensible advice for you I'm afraid. I take it contacts are not an option? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JustMe</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2004, 12:27</p><p>I hope you all don't mind my intrusion but I am looking for some help.  I recently had my glasses split in half on me and I wear a blended myodisc.  I have very high myopia.  R -12.75 L -20.5 Astigmatism in the R too of course.  Seems the doctors love to tell me how rare this script is, not many people around like me etc.  This of course is a sensitive spot for me as you can imagine. Anyway, I now have to wait almost a month to get my new glasses and they have already had my information for over a week.  Seems that the new high index plastic they will use is not very common, lab has "their work cut out for them".  My old ones are fixed for now.  Is this my only option still?  I really don't know anything other than what they tell me at the doctor's office. I was very upset when I was told this and when I voiced a concern I was told I could just forget it.  As you can imagine, it is not an option.  I want the glasses to look as good as they can, given the cirumstances.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!  JM  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2004, 23:24</p><p>Nice one yesterday. I called in at Tesco for a few things - not my local store but an enormous 'Tesco Extra' a few miles away. I was looking in the far corner for my last item when I heard a man's voice behind me say "I can't see without..." and tail off. Jules was naturally all ears and looked round to see two men with a trolley - might have been father and son - and the younger one was having several attempts at squinting along the long gangway to read the overhead signs. He was tall, about 6'2" or 6'3", with a clear complexion, high colour and fair hair cut short. Might have been in his 30s. Wore a grey fleece, blue jeans and trainers. Silly boy, I thought, that'll learn him not to leave his glasses in the car. They went one way and I another, but a few minutes later I joined the shortest checkout queue and found I was just behind them. Watched with interest - no more squinting, but then he never seemed to try to look very far, but as they talked he revealed good teeth and a nice smile. By the time I'd packed and paid, they were getting into a car nearby (the whole store is glass-fronted) and I loitered long enough to see him drive off, by which time (of course) he had his glasses back on. Couldn't see what sort of frames; could guess the Rx! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2004, 16:20</p><p>Aren't you the lucky one? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Visitboy</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2004, 13:29</p><p>Thanks Julian. Why? 'Cos I'm happy not to fall into your 'low minus' category. I've got lovely new minus fours with nice edge thickness, good cut in and a few power rings. Ooh, and tiny little lenses. Can ya tell I'm happy?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2004, 17:47</p><p>There you've put me on the spot, Mal. I think if I could be more accurate about a lens I would be. When I say low minus, I usually mean I see a little bit of minification but not much cut-in and no power rings - probably less than yours. Guessing (and no more than that) maybe up to -1.5. Not helpng much, am I? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mal</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2004, 13:54</p><p>Julian, always love to read your jottings, so well observed. But fill me in, what do you mean when you so often refer to low minus - is that as low as my own -2.75 or even lower?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2004, 07:23</p><p>For one reason or another I've been browsing through the old posts on this topic and I noticed my first mention of a young man on the buffet counter at the train station; 'slim, sallow complexion, chiselled cheekbones, a good head of dark brown hair parted in the middle. Biggish round gold specs with minus lenses, no more than -2 I guess, finished off the picture. He was pleasant and fairly chatty too. ' The other day when I was on the station he was on the bookstall for a change, wearing his other glasses - brown wire, round, low joint - and we had a short conversation about computer magazines and computers. He's as attractive as ever... </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2004, 12:34</p><p>A few odd jottings: I had business in Oxford yesterday. It was raining when I arrived; I'd left my umbrella behind and there doesn't seem to be an umbrella shop anywhere near the station, so I got wet - but, more to the point there wasn't much to jot about. The most 'spectacular' was a young guy who boarded the train at Oxford station as I got off; we were face-to-face for about two seconds, and all I saw of him was a pair of very smart clear plastic frames with low minus lenses - and that they suited him superbly! </p><p>I was away in a party for a couple of nights recently, and in the cafeteria where we were staying there was an interesting spexy youth on the staff: he was over six feet tall and thin, with a sallow complexion and an almost permanently worried expression - I was sorely tempted to pinch his backside and say "Cheer up darling, it may never happen!" But then again, that could have been what was worrying him. When he did, just occasionally, smile, it lit his face up. He was a living illustration of how good dark wire frames look with pale blue eyes. Lenses lowish minus. </p><p>And, at our stopping place on the way there and back, there was another tall thin youth working, with oblong black wire frames and a lot more minus. Both those lads could possibly have been students earning a bit of money in the vac. I shall be back at both places next month, so we'll see - if they're still working I might jot some more. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2004, 13:54</p><p>Down to the station this afternoon to get tickets for my next two train journeys. While I was in the queue I noticed a dark-skinned guy in gold aviators looking up at the monitors. Couldn't be sure, but thought his lenses were strong plus. Anyway, when he'd read what he wanted he took his glasses off with a flourish, put them away and made for the platform and was gone. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 Sep 2004, 16:32</p><p>One of the contestants on 'The Weakest Link' yesterday was a good-looking youth with dark hair and brown eyes - and the most engaging little squint whenever he looked at Anne Robinson.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Aug 2004, 09:18</p><p>Quite a few cute guys in black wire frames the last day or two; but the star of them all was a young doctor I saw when I was visiting a friend in hospital this afternoon. He was tall and slim, Asian (Indian maybe) with sculptured features and the usual straight black hair. He wore a blue shirt with light grey stripes, and would have been well worth a second look even without his glasses, which were black wire oblongs, not too strong, I think low minus with a decent amount of cylinder. Just beautiful! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;24 Aug 2004, 23:51</p><p>Glimpse from the car a couple of days ago: as I was driving up the High Street there were two guys walking down. I was almost passing them before I realized one of them was wearing glasses. He was quite scruffy, longish hair, moustache, leather coat (I think) but his specs were round, in fine gold wire, and so unobtrusive as to be almost invisible - no idea of the Rx - but they looked good on him. Once I noticed them. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Aug 2004, 22:57</p><p>Joined a day trip to York yesterday. The city was full of tourists, lots of good loking spexy guys among them, but the one who interested me most was the coach driver, a not bad looking guy in his thirties with thinning fairish hair cut short. Wouldn't have looked twice at him till he started driving: at first I thought he was wearing shades though the tint wasn't all that dark, but once or twice he pushed them down to look over tham at something on the dashboard. Closer inspection revealed a low minus Rx with significant cylinder. They were wire ovals; the temples were black but I never got a good enough view of the front of the frames to be sure - they may have been gold. Whenever we stopped he took them off and became ordinary again - they really did something for him! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Aug 2004, 13:54</p><p>Spent some of my time in St Andrews this week - yes, I know it's the home of golf, but the summer school of Scottish dancing was on, and I'm into that in a big way... </p><p>On two occasions I was rather taken with one of the dancers, a thin dark boy with crisp black hair, pale-ish complexion, brown eyes and lowish minus lenses in black wire oval frames which suited him superbly. I think he may have been German or Danish - English wasn't his native language. No regular dancng partner or obvious girl friend... </p><p>In the pub later, there were two good-looking guys sitting in a corner. One of them had his back to me but I could see he was wearing glasses. After a while it was obvious he was coming up to the bar to buy drinks and I had a grandstand view. Decent figure, fairish hair, fresh complexion, mole above his lip, brown eyes, rimless glasses with black temples and gold hinges, and what lenses! Must have been -8 at least. I had a three-quarter view, and I could see his right eye twice: once behind the lens and once through it. That's cut-in! </p><p>Finally, in the same pub another day , it was pretty crowded and in a grup to the next table there was a slim guy with short very fair hair, fair complexion, pale blue eyes and glasses: low minus lenses in white wire frames which looked very good with his colouring. Foul-mouthed though ::( </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sophie</b>&nbsp;12 Aug 2004, 12:59</p><p>Hello Julian and friends! I hope you dont mind me joining in your jottings! </p><p> </p><p>Ive had a rather boring fortnight auditing a small building surveyors company but there has been one rather intriguing scenario that became rather amusing today. There is a lovely guy called simon in the office and all week Id been observing his manner when looking at his computer screen and doing general work. He has definitely been struggling and I quietly said to myself that he could do with a trip to specsavers! Anyway to my absolute delight I got to go out and observe a job with him today and we went hairing off rather speedily in his BMW then suddenly he reached around and produced a pair of oblong silvery wire specs! Good I thought, that would explain all. But inspecting them closely they appeared to be about +2 Rx and maybe some astigmatism correction. How bazaar that he struggles around the office only to put on his plus specs whilst driving. Also as soon as the car stopped he whipped them off! And then more interestingly when we got a bit lost and signs needed reading he appeared not to be able to read them so asked me and then I had to rummage for my specs (- 2.25am nearly a full time wearer) to see them. He then promptly said as we made a wrong turning Ah another half blind person!! A brilliant afternoon. I shall be sad to leave tomorrow!  </p><p> </p><p>Big hugs </p><p>Sophie </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2004, 07:33</p><p>One or two more sightings from Scotland: </p><p>The other evening I called in at Tesco to get a couple of itmes, and was entranced by one of the assistants who was stocking shelves...actually when I first saw him he was chatting to some friends. It sounded as if they were going to a party in the near future; one girl was saying, "I hope you're not going to come in those sandals" and he said "You mean my flip-flops? I certainly am!" He was wearing smart trainers, nondescript pants, and a Tesco uniform shirt in blue check. (Tesco staff all wear either red or blue check shirts.) He had medium brown hair with lots of blonde highlights, a slightly sallow complexion, a broad smile that showed very good teeth, and biggish oblong glasses: black wire frames and minus lenses, about -2 to -3. Real eye candy! </p><p>One day I called in at Vision Express to get a lens cloth (another thing that got left behind!) and ther was an interesting sight there. Their instore lab is glass fronted and you can see the staff at work. There were TWO technicians at work there, both quite scruffy-looking in general - one had spiky hair, the other a beard - but both wore very UNscruffy glasses: semi-rimless with clear plastic frames. As far as I could see they both had low plus prescriptions. Very smart, but a shade incongruous! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2004, 07:19</p><p>Old stagers will remember that on *two* previous occasions when I've been away from home my glasses have come to grief. This time I decided to be prepared, and put my old glasses (very small difference in Rx) in one of my bags. So far, so good. Then, just as I was getting ready to leave home, a phone call came about a crisis that needed immediate attention, then a less desperate matter had to be dealt with...halfway up the M6 I realized I'd left home without that bag. No spare glasses. No charger for the mobile phone. No radio or camera. No glucose meter (I'm Type II diabetic). </p><p>But no major problems till Saturday morning when I put my glasses down on a book on the edge of a shelf, the whole lot hit the deck, the left lens fell out, and I discovered I had a screw loose - or rather completely gone! </p><p>My uncorrected vision is not bad, it just gives new meaning to the words 'barely adequate'. Unless of course I want to read anything when it's hopeless. I could probably drive without correction, but didn't care to try it. Anyway, I got a lift to the nearest optician's, where in a few minutes all was well. </p><p>Bonus: just as the car drew up two big strapping guys walked by, in the direction I was going. Their hair was so similar I thought they must be brothers, maybe even twins, and they both wore glasses with dark wire frames. I walked as briskly as I could but failed to catch up - but I thought they both had moderate minus lenses. Nice sighting anyway. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2004, 04:25</p><p>Away from home at the moment, and using a computer at the local library; but some interesting sightings: </p><p>1. Last week, before I came away from home, shopping in a big Sainsbury's: one of the customer service boys was slight with black hair and glasses - no beauty, but very pleasant and helpful when we had a problem. My friend remarked that he was Harry Potter-ish which in a way he was. Hair was a bit too tidy, and the specs weren't round - oval-is black wire with a strong plus Rx. </p><p>2. In the bank yesterday, one of the tellers was a thin dark guy with rimless specs, quite a strong minus Rx. To my disappointment when my turn came I had to go to someone else ::( </p><p>3. In a music shop yesterday afternoon, one of the assistants was the most beautiful youth: short brown hair, designer stubble, narrow jaw and chiselled cheeks, black wire frames of a slightly unusual type with a lowish minus Rx. Again I just missed being served my him ::( Never mind, he was a lovely sight. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>sophie</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2004, 12:17</p><p> </p><p>I have to say I saw the most facinating pair of specs on a v nice guy today. he was a building inspector and he appeared to be myopic (-3.5 i'd say) in one eye and hyperopic (+ 2.5) in the other. I knew this was possible but have never seen anyone wearing glasses like this before....i guess contacts would be preferable. anyway this guy was very cute and i'd certainly like to meet him again. maybe i should make some dodgy alterations to my loft conversion then  he'll come back!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2004, 16:42</p><p>Hard to say, Clare; I like those styles but sometimes something else is just so right on a particular face - like the tall slim Asian guy I caught a couple of glimpses of the other day: squarish black plastic frames, and they looked wonderful on hims. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2004, 14:16</p><p>Julian - you seem to spot all the guys with the low minus lenses, and there seem to be lots of them. Do you think that rimless and semi-rimless enhance a guy's looks more than other styles? I have to say, I think so!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Jul 2004, 11:28</p><p>Don't know where to post this one really; it isn't a sighting, it isn't on the web, it isn't really about an actor. When I got into the car after lunch today the radio was tuned to BBC Radio 4, and the repeat of 'The Archers' was on...for those who don't know this is a loonnnggg running radio soap that was once billed as 'an everyday story of country folk'. Anyway, I was just in time to hear that slag Lilian saying, "You look like a cross between Buddy Holly and Harry Potter". Naturally I sat up and took notice. Apparently she was talking to her nephew? cousin? Tony Archer, but whether he had just got glasses or, more probably, broken them and mended them with sticky tape, I couldn't be sure. (I'd never imagined him as wearing glasses, but there you are.) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Jul 2004, 23:26</p><p>Had to go to London on Sunday and come back yesterday. The train to London was very interesting: diagonally opposite me in the carriage was a very handsome guy (Asian? Arab?) with short black hair and low minus glasses with white metal frames. He was with his wife or girl friend and as they talked he smiled a lot, showing a mouthful of straight white teeth; there were several guys in the carriage with semi-rimless specs that really enhanced their appearance; sighting of the day was a very tall, very slim guy who passed through the carriage at one point...small gunmetal wire ovals (I kept watching for thim to pass back again, but no luck). One tantalizing thing: when I got up to go to the loo I had quite a long walk to find one that was vacent; on the way there was a slim blond guy wearing earphones; on the table in front of him a black glasses case - no chance to see what his glasses were like, let along what he looked like wearing them ::( </p><p>Where I was staying was a tube and bus journey from Euston. At the bus stop in the morning there was a bit of a wait with no sign of a bus. The first one that came was full, but there were two more right behind it (You know what they say, London buses are like radishes: red and come in bunches). While I waited I was watching with interest a big black guy in a grey suit who squinted, hard, almost non-stop into the distance to see if there was a bus coming. If he doesn't have glasses he certainly needs them; if he does he ought to wear them - but I guess that's his business. </p><p>On the first tube train there was a big tall guy with his girl friend; longish fair hair, sculptured features, brown wire frames with low minus lenses. On the platform at Camden Town there there was a young guy with a pale complexion and untidy dark hair, in grey jeans and a black T-shirt - and black-framed glasses with a strong minus Rx; maybe -7 or -8. We got into the same carriage and I observed him with interest for the rest of the journey.  </p><p>Around the streets, lots of sexy spexy guys; too many to describe. And the main line train home was without interest. But it was a good trip on the whole, jotting-wise. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2004, 07:08</p><p>There I go again - a nice SIGHT ::) </p><p>J</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2004, 07:07</p><p>Out to a local pub for lunch today. After the meal was interested to see a tall blond lad playing with himself (as you might say) on the snooker table. He was dressed in white from top to toe (with bits of colour here and there); hair cut short, eyes blue, cool glasses - dark wire oblongs with a low minus Rx. A nice site for a Sunday afternoon. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2004, 23:25</p><p>*or* so. </p><p>J</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2004, 23:25</p><p>I meant to mention another guy who was stacking shelves in Sainsburys: very tall, maybe 6'3", and broad shouldered; dressed in black or maybe dark navy uniform which fitted closely over his neat backside; brown eyes, and the most beautiful glossy dark hair in a ponytail that reached almost to his waist. The only thing was, he wasn't wearing glasses ... but of course he might have had contacts ... and if all else fails he'll definitely need readers in another twenty years so so ::) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Jul 2004, 17:10</p><p>In Sainsburys this afternoon (a big new branch) there were two lads wheeling a trolley round and stocking up the fresh fruit and vegetable shelves. One of them had brown hair cut short under a baseball cap, a day or two's growth of beard or rather stubble, pale blue eyes - oblong black wire rims with lenses around -4. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2004, 07:16</p><p>Sightings in pubs: Last night, in a pub in a small town about fifty miles from here which I've visited a few times before but not for some time, a new barman: dark complexion, foreign accent (Spanish? Italian? Greek? Turkish? I don't know). Black hair, brown eyes, ready smile, glasses. Squared-off ovals with minus lenses, not too strong, but strong enough for him to keep them on all the time. </p><p>Then this lunch time, having lunch with a friend in a pub a mile down the road. The place was busy, and we had to sit and wait for a table. A group watching Wimbledon on TV at the other end of the room. I noticed a guy (dark hair, goatee beard, put on a pair of specs with black wire oval frames to watch. Not a myope either; discreet observation showed the lenses were plus - not high but definitely plus.  </p><p>Finally, when we got to our table there was what I took to be a family party two tables away - parents and son, all in glasses. The parents had their backs to us; mother seemed to have minus lenses and dad plus, but the son who was facing our way was quite interesting: late teens I guess, dark hair worn longish and greased a bit, fresh complexion, hint of down on his upper lip, black T-shirt, quite an interesting pair of specs. Black wire ovals with a pice of meta from high on the frame to make a joint with the temples. Lenses plus, I was pretty sure. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2004, 02:02</p><p>Young guy came into the office the other day: tall, casually not to say scruffily dressed, but pleasant and polite. Tallish; untidy black hair, unshaven (might have been cultivating a moustache). Would I be mentioning him here if he didn't wear glasses? Oval wire covered with black plastic, gold metal temples. Noticeably strong minus lenses - going on the cut-in I estimate -7 or so. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2004, 18:30</p><p>Filthy, my sweet, how many years is it since I (and others who were here at the time) declared you an honorary queen? </p><p>Two, not so much sightings, more like glimpses from the car. Different places, different guys. In each case a mop of fairish hair. In one case hand-in-hand with a girl. In each case dark wire ovals. In one case (the one with the girl) tinted lenses. In each case I had no time to do more than think "Cute!" as I drove by. Little things mean a lot. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2004, 18:17</p><p>I wasn't fishing for compliments but (fx: blushes slightly) thanks for the kind words. </p><p>Anyway, I was in London on Monday and while waiting for my train home went to the coffee shop for an espresso. Behind the counter were three guys in black T-shirts, none of them wildly exciting; but the smallest one, as he took my money, looked over my shoulder and gave a little squint. So I sat down where I could observe, and saw the squint two or three times more when he looked at the other end of the shop or beyond. Something appealing about a low myope who can cope without glasses up to a point. No way of knowing, of course, whether he has glasses for distant work, or even knows he needs them... </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2004, 09:19</p><p>I hate to admit being so unsophisticated, but I actually hadn't come across the gay version of flaming and thought it was the other sort that was under discussion - hence my last post. My good friend Filthy and others will remember that 'Julian's jottings' date right back to the original EyeScene polls before the first BBS, and when Wurm launched the present BBS he gave a pretty clear hint that he'd be happy to see them continuing.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2004, 09:56</p><p>I don't think I have been 'flameing' anybody, but perhaps I was a bit defensive in view of some comments which Wurm was kind enough to delete.

As it was, he was a most enjoyable distraction. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2004, 08:53</p><p>I want to know what "flameing" is.  It doesn't appear to be found in any English dictionaries; perhaps it's a foreign word or a neologism.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2004, 23:50</p><p>Working lunch yesterday with two colleagues, both straight ::( Wished I could point out the lovely young barman - short fair hair, pink complexion with just a hint of freckles, neat figure, dark wire frames with low minus lenses, maybe -1.5. Real eye candy (and no more than that!) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2004, 17:50</p><p>Two interesting sightings while shopping in ASDA this evening: </p><p>1. a handsome, smartly-dressed Pakistani guy with a neat short beard and black wire frames with reasonably strong PLUS lenses. Perhaps the exception that proves the rule that 'spexy Pakis are myopes.'  </p><p>2. As I left the store I all but bumped into John whom I mentioned in my last post. He has grown his beard again and his hair is quite shaggy-looking. For the first time ever I managed to get a sight of the lenses in his oval-to-round specs, and they are low MINUS, not at all what I thought. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2004, 09:21</p><p>Updates on the spexy guys who live around here: </p><p>1. John, who lives round the corner with his delightful younger brother Andrew who is the local window-cleaner (I often see Andrew around the streets, usually cleaning windows, sometimes walking the dog, often with another guy in tow. I wonder... But Andrew doesn't wear glasses so he doesn't really qualify for a mention here.) John is taller and very thin, with a lot of black hair and till recently a bushy black beard. I sometimes see him riding a bike, yes, the old-fashioned push bike, as if he was working nights or evenings - but I have no idea what woprk he does. Anyway, the beard has gone and the hair is less shaggy than it was. Mostly when I see him, which isn't often, he's wearing his glasses - oval to round gold wire frames with, I think, low plus lenses. Never forget the rush the first time I saw him in glasses, several years ago. Wish I had an opportunity of getting to know him better. </p><p>2. The lad I have nicknamed Philip - fair hair and round dark wire frames with a strong plus Rx - I hadn't seen for ages and was wondering if he was away at college or something and only home in the vac. He re-appeared shortly after Easter and I thought maybe I was right about that; but he seems to have been around a lot ever since. He's driving a Fiat Punto (a lot newer than my Vauxhall Corsa!) and Ive seen him in it several times in the evening as if he was coming home from work. A few Sundays ago he got out of it by the corner shop wearing shorts, a T-shirt and trainers and I enjoyed the sight of his legs...yesterday as I was going out to lunch I drove by the local park and he and a group of other young guys were kicking a ball about: shorts, trainers and glasses - a lovely sight. On the way back from lunch they were still playing but he's taken his glasses off. Wonder how well he sees without them; they're pretty strong and he's been wearing them full time for, I guess, over a year (before that he had smaller round gold frames which really suited him, but only part-time.) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 May 2004, 17:01</p><p>Now that I've started...on recent visits to the nearest Tesco, two boys on the customer service desk who've both been working there a good while: one, extra friendly and helpful when he was on the checkout a while back, always wore strongish plus glasses and had bad acne but when I saw him last was minus acne and bareyed; the other, fair curly hair and clear complexion, hooked nose like a young Mr Punch and wire ovals with a minus Rx, has graduated to squarish semi-rimless, stronger and certainly sexier. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 May 2004, 11:51</p><p>My first proper jotting in ages - lots more to come when I have the time. In a pub a few miles out of town the other evening. Two guys came up to the bar asking for chalk to mark their darts scores. Both had blond hair, which might have been natural. One wore black oblongs with strong plus lenses; the other gold ovals with strong minus, maybe -8. Might have been fun to watch their game, but I was with friends. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2004, 13:27</p><p>A long-awaited sighting last night! We had a mid-Lent party at church, and I was asked to call a few cards of bingo. When I went into the hall I immediately spotted the churchwarden's 25-year-old son sitting at one of the tables with his girl friend, and he was wearing glasses. They don't live here; he got a good degree in classics and has been managing pubs ever since in different parts of the country. I knew he had glasses but had never seen him wearing them; a few years ago when he was at university his mother was kind of scandalized because he'd lost them for a fortnight and then found them in his bed. And I was pretty sure he was short-sighted by the way I've seen him hold a book up to his eyes. Anyway, there he was. </p><p>He's a big guy, well over six feet and broad-shouldered; black hair and highish colour. The glasses were semi-rimless, not quite oblong. I went to chat at the supper break, naturally enough, not having seen him far ages. His right lens was quite significantly minus - not high but maybe around -2 or -3. I couldn't be sure, but thought the left one was weaker. </p><p>I think his elder brother and sister have specs too (they live away too) but have never seen them wear them. Never mind, that's a start. </p><p>Totally off topic, the bingo tickets were printed by the Scottish Automatic PrinTing Co. Ltd, 46 CharLes Street, CARDIFF! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2004, 01:23</p><p>Another glimpse from the car. First thing this morning - I wish I'd been walking but it was raining - I used the car to go up the road. Saw a young couple leave their house and start down the road. He was in jeans and a parka, close-cropped hair and squarish black metal frames. I got a fleeting impression, no more than that, of a substantial plus Rx. But I'll walk that way in future and keep my eyes open and my glasses clean! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2004, 13:24</p><p>Ah yes, the beautiful things out and about, in restaurants, in malls, on the street, in the bank, at the airport, it's what makes a day float by pleasantly. It doesn't matter how crappy the day has been when you pull into the gas station and the guy pumping gas is a gorgeous guy in glasses. Just for a moment there, all is bliss. And such has been my life!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2004, 13:19</p><p>Hardly a sighting, just a glimpse really; as I was driving down the road yesterday morning, there was a tall, well-built guy with fairish hair and a clear complexion walking the opposite way on the other side. He was wearing the coolest glasses - dark wire ovals, not a chance of seeing what kind of Rx. But he was decidedly ornamental. Ships that pass in the night... </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2004, 12:44</p><p>At a meeting all day yesterday; some of the discussions were boring, others not, but I was distracted by the young guy sitting immediately in front of me: tall, slim, pale complexion, jeans and brown sweatshirt with cream-coloured panels at the shoulders. Low minus specs, which he never took off even at the coffee and lunch breaks. Superbly well-chosen frames: round wire, covered with brown plastic, slightly ornate temples. I guess they were new and maybe his first pair; the Rx was -1 at the most with no cylinder. I enjoyed looking over his shoulder at the slightly minified view beyond. Interesting, in view of discussions on other threads, that he was obviously a full-time wearer with such a low Rx. And he certainly provide light relief in the boring bits of the meeting. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2004, 04:14</p><p>Hyperopes again! The two young ones I jotted about a couple of weeks ago. Saw them again the other day, in fact I crossed the road (at pelican crossing) alongside the taller and more colourful one - and he certainly is hyperopic! At one point when we were three to four feet apart I managed to look through his right lens, and saw a tiny inverted image of the street through it. Mind you, I think the other one's lenses are pretty strong too. </p><p>(Note: they were both wearing school ties, which puts them well off limits. But let me assure anyone who has doubts about my morals, apart from their specs there is nothing the least bit interesting about either of them!) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2004, 00:11</p><p>David, I've taken a time to answer your question...don't forget my jottings are highly selective. If I see a lot of guys in minus lenses the odd one with plus may seem worth mentioning. It is a myth that there are more myopes than hyperopes about; it's just that low hyperopes cope better without correction, or without full time correction, than low myopes. There were a couple of posts from David Llewellyn a month or two ago that made all this very clear; I forget which threads they were on. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phoropter</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2004, 22:19</p><p>DNBursky  </p><p>I know this was directed at Julian, but I wanted to add my 2 cents.  As an optometrist in the US, it seems I fit nearly all younger high hyperopes with contact lenses.  Personally, I am convinced that most younger people in the US are embarressed to have their eyes magnified by high plus lenses.  Many of my high plus elementary kids get made fun of lots and are very conscience of their appearance.  They generally are asking for contacts by 3rd or 4th grade and most parents are all too happy to have Johnny looking "normal". </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2004, 01:06</p><p>It's been a while since I have posted. Julian, I noticed that you have seen many guys wearing plus lenses, many under 40.

I know of very few hyperopes as opposed to tons of myopes and people with presbyopia. </p><p> </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brett</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2004, 04:34</p><p>The earlier reference by Julian to plaited dreadlocks prompted me to share two sightings on a recent trip to Thailand.  In a bookstore a good looking young (20ish) oriental guy with a small crop of plaited dreadlocks on the top centre of his head (shaved all round) wearing very small oval black wire frames with fairly serious minus lenses.  Altogether, rather erotic! </p><p>Another interesting sighting on a flight from Phutket to Bangkok... I was seated diagonally behind (across the aisle one row behind) a Western guy mid to late thirties with thick (quarter inch / 6mm at least) rimless glasses with serious minification from where I was sitting.  Strangely, he removed them for take-off and again for landing!  Sneaking very frequent looks at the minature world in front of him through the lens nearest to me was a pleasant way of passing time on the two hour flight! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guest#8</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2004, 11:54</p><p>Julian </p><p>I've seen this young man maybe in his early twenties, wearing the strangest pair of glasses i have ever seen.  They are small ovals the fronts look flat and thin, but the bottom outside corners are at least half an inch thick. They also look scooped out. like little ledges. I have never seen anything like this, what do you think?  Do you know what this is?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pia</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2004, 11:10</p><p>Yeh!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2004, 10:50</p><p>Out in the snow this morning, noticed two young lads and a girl chatting at a street corner. The taller lad (blonde hair, high colour) was wearing dark-rimmed wire glasses. Then a reflection showed that the smaller one had specs too. I conveniently remembered that I had a letter to post, and that to get to the post box I had to cross the road and pass close to the group. The smaller guy was less striking than the other (pale face, mousey hair, colourless frames) but they were both wearing quite strong PLUS lenses. </p><p>A sighting from the car the other afternoon: a youngster I know who has very occasionally appeared in black wire ovals with a really low minus Rx (told me, "I'm slightly short sighted" which I had worked out for myself). This time he was walking up the street wearing different glasses - grey metal I thought, and a bit squarer. Another case where the myopia increases and/or after a day's clear vision the specs stay on for the journey home. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2004, 17:19</p><p>Trip to London yesterday, with two nice sightings on the way home: </p><p>Next to me on the train, by the window, was a young guy who might have been from somewhere in the Gulf region, wearing rimless glasses with a low minus Rx, less than -1 at a guess; they sat rather high on his nose and off the face. At one point he took them off and slept for a while; I was asleep some of the time as well. After about Lichfield he was looking out of the window at the view, but it was several minutes before he put his glasses back on. </p><p>Among those getting off at my stop was a tall thin black boy (actually café-au-lait) - beautiful hands with long fingers, lots of hair in plaited dreadlocks, and lowish minus lenses in wire frames. Very striking altogether. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2004, 07:08</p><p>It's OK Electra, I've got it and am pondering. Later </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2004, 06:31</p><p>Julian, did you get my e-mail with the links (Depp/Affleck)? I'm not trying to pressure you, it's just that Yahoo has been so screwed up the last few days (anyone else noticed?) I was concerned you hadn't received it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2004, 16:57</p><p>A few jottable sightings... </p><p>Yesterday in town, a tall young guy, carrying a little boy. He (the dad) had short dark crinkly hair, and beautiful oblong semi-rimless specs, black metal frames, a bit heavier than some. Strong minus Rx; I guessed -6. We crossed over one street at the same time; then I had to cross another and they carried on down. </p><p>This morning, early, just round the corner here, met a young guy coming down as I went up: chunky sweater, bobble hat, oval wire frames, tinted minus lenses. gave me a 'good morning'...I think I've seen him around before, but not recently. </p><p>Later on in the morning, on my way to get a haircut, spotted a smart-looking guy coming the other way; thought, oh, he's wearing glasses. When he got closer it turned out to be a guy I know (know his wife too) and have mentioned here before. Probably pushing 40 by now; plus specs, not negligible, though I've seen him bareyed (and kind of disorientated looking. The frames were white metal, and he was wearing a tiny goatee beard. Nice smell of aftershave as he passed. </p><p>The next minute, a tall guy, walking in the same direction as the last one. From the distance I saw him put his hands up as if to take glasses off, and that's what he was doing. Almost immediately he put them back on and was wearing them as he passed me. He was tall as I mentioned before, with untidy fark hair and a scruffy beard. His frames were very basic round or oval wire; couldn't tell if the lenses were plus or minus, but I don't think they were very strong and they certainly suited him. Don't remember seeing him around before; wouldn't mind seeing him again. </p><p>Couple of new guys on the block: one has nice chestnut-coloured hair cut short, pale face and rather disappointing specs, dark wire, low minus. The other wears blue mostly, including a baseball cap under which I can see wire frames with plus lenses. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2004, 06:01</p><p>Oh Jules &lt;groan&gt; that's almost as bad as my "Just a thong at twilight" remark yesterday, and you don't want to hear the rest of that story............. </p><p> </p><p>As this is your jottings thread and I can ramble on a bit, I fixed the link to the Johnny Depp pictures. They're killing me. One looks like an obvious minus cut-in, but the others are just weird. I don't know it's light reflecting or what so please give it your best. How many days until "Secret Window" comes out and we can see the rimless ones on a 20 foot screen.....SURELY that'll be easier?

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2004, 22:53</p><p>Electra: it wouldn't work for small print, but holding stuff close gives it a bigger share of the visual field or something (Curt, if you can put this better, please...). I've just tried to read a printed page without my glasses, and if the print wasn't too small I could make some sense of it. (But as for trying sing a hymn I didn't already know, forget it!) And I remember a teacher at school who, before he got reading glasses, used to hold the book very close and squint hard at it. </p><p>As for heredity, one of the rules is that a characteristic often lies dormant for three generations and re-appears in the fourth. Perhaps she had a hyperopic great-great-grandparent. The Chinaman whose wife produced a fair-haired, blue-eyed baby didn't necessarily have grounds for divorce when he said "Two Wongs don't make a White". </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2004, 11:40</p><p>Jules: Moral #1 is a "WOW" moment....I'm going to have to give that some thought......... </p><p> </p><p>But heredity is weird. My brother-in-law is really myopic, I'd guess about -10, bare minimum, but my niece is hyperopic, guessing +4? and almost in her teens. Mom (my sister) like me has 20/20 vision, and my nephew (early teens) does too. Work that one out.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2004, 16:40</p><p>In church today, one of the kids being baptized along with his two little sisters was a hyperactive lad of  about seven with strong plus glasses. During the service I saw that his father was holding the hymn book about six inches from his eyes, and I thought, "Gosh, you're myopic!" A bit later when there were answers to be made I saw he hadn't got a service sheet and tried to pass him one (I was quite close) but he whispered something about not having his glasses, and later on I saw he had his nose buried in the hymn book again.  </p><p>After the service when we were all milling around I saw him and said, "That'll learn you not to come to church without your glasses." He said, "Oh, they're broken; it's an expensive business. Funny though, if I could have borrowed Billy's glasses I'd have been fine; they're exactly the same." </p><p>Moral No. 1: Not every guy who sticks his nose against the page is myopic. </p><p>Moral No. 2: Heredity rules OK. </p><p>Incidentally he was a smart-looking guy, solidly built with close-cropped hair and very striking amber-to-hazel eyes...I'd love to see those eyes behind lenses like the kid's. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2004, 09:33</p><p>Interesting (if at times tantalizing) afternoon the other day. I had to transfer some funds from one bank to another. At the first bank I had to wait a few minutes; manning one of the tills was a tall good-looking boy with glasses who was discussing something with one of the managers. I kept hoping I would be called up to his till but I ended up with the girl next to him. While I was at the counter they finished their conversation; he took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. I was distracted for a moment and when I looked his way again he was typing into the computer bareyed, glasses nowhere to be seen...I never managed to get any impression of the Rx, but I was puzzled that he was working without them. Then along the street to the other bank, where I was attended to by a young lad with a poor attempt at a moustache and minus lenses in wire frames that weren't quite big enough for his face. Pity - but he was charm and politenss personified. </p><p>Then to buy an in-car charger for my mobile phone. The cashiers there wore mauve shirts and ties, and one of them had near-oval white metal frames with lenses around -2. I noticed the one who served me held my debit card rather close to his eyes, so who knows? </p><p>Finally, getting a few bits and pieces in Sainsburys, I kept passing a young guy, probably a sudent, with longish fair hair and white metal frames with a lot of cylinder in his Rx. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2004, 10:13</p><p>Just been to collect my car which has been in for service and MOT (annual inspection) today. The boss is quite good-looking (40s I guess, fair, no specs, navy overalls) but the guy who came out of the office to attend to me! Slim, sallow, black hair, brown eyes - could be whole or part Italian though no accent - denim shirt and bulky car coat.

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2004, 14:37</p><p>it's because lenses act as if they are more minus (or less plus, as you wish) with decreasing vertex distance.  In other words, A the effect of a plus lens gets weaker as you move it closer to your eye, while that of a minus lens gets stronger. </p><p> </p><p>This means that nearsighted people wear contacts with lower prescriptions than their glasses, while farsighted people wear contacts with higher Rx than their glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Of course, like most other effects associated with prescriptions (chromatic aberration, etc), the effect is much more noticeable at higher prescriptions than loswer.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2004, 12:49</p><p>Funny the different uses people make of their glasses. In the pub last night (the same one as last Saturday) there was a group of young people round a table; I gradually realized that one of them was the same guy I saw last week and that I'd got some of the details wrong. His nose is big and he wears his (oval) glasses so far from his eyes that he could easily look out under them; anyway, it was him. He and another guy got up to get a round of drinks from the bar, and I noticed the other guy had a pair of glasses hooked on his black T-shirt. The next time I looked he had put his glasses on to read the pump clips (it's a pub that specializes in real ales and the range changes constantly). He had black wire frames and with a bit more minus than the big guy who keeps his on all the time. Soon after that I looked their way again and the second guy had taken his off again; whether they were back on his shirt or on the table I couldn't see. See what I mean? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Curious about hyperopia</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2004, 14:32</p><p>Just wondering. I just got a new pair of glasses. I am 43 yrs. old. My rx is +6.25 and +7.50 with +.25 cyl. and 100 axis only for the L eye. I have worn glasses and contacts forever. Do you know why my contacts are +8.00 and +9.00?

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2004, 06:49</p><p>OK: as you know, if you look through a minus lens from a distance you'll see minification of the distant view, and through a plus lens magnification if it's weak and if it's good and strong minification plus inversion. Where there's a substantial amount of cylinder there will also be distortion - the image you see will be elongated along the axis of the cylinder. Where there's more cylinder than sphere, and the lens is actually minus in one axis and plus at right angles to that, it's totally distorted, and may look like a plus lens when you're close to it and minus when you're further away. Just don't ask about prism, 'cause I don't know! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2004, 05:33</p><p>Jules, please be my teacher - when you say "more cylinder than anything" what are you seeing? I'm really hopeless at this.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Jan 2004, 17:39</p><p>Wnt to do some shopping in Tesco tonight.There was a young guy shopping with (?) his mother; they had a trolley each and he kept going off with his to different parts of the store to find things. he was medium height, slim, in jeans and a chunky black sweater; thick fairish hair. So far so good. Face a bit nondescript but redeemed by the most beautiful pair of rimless glasses. Anybody whose taste is that good must have something going for him.  </p><p>In another family group was a kid too young for me to notice - but his specs were quite striking: black wire ovals, looked plus but more cylinder than anything. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Jan 2004, 17:29</p><p>Most of this week I've been working in a group of fifteen people of various ages, twelve men and three women. Besides myself, two other men of my own age wear plus specs full time, or all but. One wears them on a cord but never seems to take them off; they aren't bifocals and don't seem to be progressives either. One man and one woman wear minus. Three men are bareyed all the time - one definitely older than me, one a bit younger (how do they manage without readers? monovison contacts perhaps?), and the youngest of us all. The rest all wear plus glasses part time, some more than others. One guy (whom I know quite well) wears them a lot of the time, and his are progressives. My guess is that if he isn't moving toward full time wear he ought to be. But how's about that for a sample of the population? </p><p>I wrote the last paragraph part-way through the week. When we dispersed this morning I saw - from a distance - the youngest guy of the group (early 30s, spiky dark hair, pale complexion, neat figure) get into his car and drive off. I had an impression that he was wearing glasses then; but the distance was to great and the time to short to be sure ::( </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Jan 2004, 17:16</p><p>A few sightings last weekend: Saturday evening in a pub (the same one where I spotted young David in glasses the other evening) two couples in the corner of the 'no smoking' room; from what I overheard I gathered it was a young courting couple with her parents. The young guy was enormously tall, maybe six foot four or five, and broad shouldered. Short but untidy gingery hair. Blue jeans and blue top, trainers; clear complexion, nice smile, lovely dark blue eyes - and, yes, they looked out at the world through low minus lenses, no rims; gunmetal grey temples. </p><p>Sunday, at church. A good-looking young guy I've mentioned before (late 20s) who used to wear contacts is now always in glasses because of the work he is doing (fumes/dust?) Anyway he's got new glasses: dark wire, narrower from top to bottom than the old ones, tinted or maybe photochromic lenses: strong plus on the right, weak minus on the left. </p><p>And on Monday, doing some shopping in a strange town, I stopped to look in a bargain shop where there was a good-looking guy in glasses behind the counter. Seeing that they were selling sets of luggage very cheap, I went in. The luggage was a real bargain - and the guy behind the counter was well worth a second look too: slim, dark hair, pleasant smile, black wire oblongs with a not-to-be-sneezed-at minus prescription. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Jan 2004, 18:29</p><p>Real life has its moments too. There's a pub a couple of miles away (not my local) where I meet up with a group of friends from time to time, and tonight was one of the times. Some of them were just leaving as I arrived tonight, including a father and son, both really nice guys. David (the son) is tall and slim, with a fresh clear complexion and short black hair, a bit longer at the moment. The last few weeks he's been sporting a small goatee beard as well, which suits him quite well. Tonight, all this and GLASSES TOO - black wire ovals which complement the rest of his looks perfectly. I shall have to wait for another sighting to get any clue about his Rx, but if he's gone straight into full time wear I'd expect a low minus. On the other hand it could be that he's worn them part time for years and this is the first time I've seen him wearing them...who knows? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2004, 23:24</p><p>Builders called round about some repairs; thought perhaps they were father and son. Older man with gold aviators, plus, bifocal. Younger, big and butch, not at all bad looking, with a significant plus Rx in dark wire frames. Can easily cope with having him around for a few days - though the son of the last contractor was really pretty, and spexy, and, I'm almost certain, a friend of the family.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2003, 05:32</p><p>Another update: I posted in March about a young married couple I see at infrequent intervals. When I saw them he had glasses which he kept putting away in the case rather self-consciously. Saw them again today and he didin't take them off once. Kind of bears out my theory that they were his very new first specs in March. BUT: I see from my March post that they were white metal with brown temples. These today were all gold. Of course there may have been a two-for-one offer at Specsavers. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p>To save Pia the trouble, I'll add: Yeh!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2003, 15:20</p><p>&lt;bowing to Julian&gt; yes, that makes sense. All that it means to me is that I get to see him in glasses regularly, and oh.......oh............but it's nice to know why!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2003, 10:47</p><p>A really intriguing sighting this afternoon: as we were coming away from church, a Pakistani family was having a party in the church hall. Several young guys were coming and going, and passed the time of day as they went. As I was about to start the car up I saw four youths approaching the door. It was quite dark, but I could see one of them was wearing glasses, so naturally... When they got through the open door and into the light (I could see they were dark wire ovals) he turned and looked at his reflection in the window glass, adjusted the specs slightly, and then took them off and gave them to one of the others, who put them on and went on into the party (and out of sight as far as I was concerned). I'm pondering the possible scenarios. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2003, 10:37</p><p>Yes Electra; and it occurs to me that if his left eye is really bad he needs to see well with his right...another reason for full-time wear. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Electra</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2003, 08:10</p><p>Julian, exactly, that's what I thought.....but I wanted to hear it from an expert before I made an idiot of myself. Netscape crashes regularly, never sure why it's not been banned.....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2003, 00:10</p><p>Interesting sighting yesterday: the hyperopic lad whom I call Philip, walking up the street with another young guy. Not wearing his pebble glasses, but continuously squinting just like an uncorrected myope. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2003, 00:06</p><p>Electra: your first site crashed Netscape on me, so I re-booted and tried IE...having got that off my chest, I'm still puzzled. Those specs don't look all that strong (no power rings, no cut-in that I can see); on the other hand there was one pic with him bare-eyed and squinting, but I've seen hyperopes doing that as well as myopes... see my next post. There is a reference to him having one bad eye. And he's had glasses since he was a kid (but hasn't needed to go down the contacts road like the lovely myopic Elijah Wood). </p><p>I'm going to guess at hyperopia, with or without astigmatism into the bargain. This would explain his wearing specs part time since childhood but needing them full time now that his accommodation is failing...I could easily be persuaded that the left lens in one of those Secret Window pics is strongish plus. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;09 Dec 2003, 23:06</p><p>Dearest Concerned, Julian may be taking the high road in response to your petty self-important moral policing but I won't. Who do you think you are to invade this space we've been visiting for years? If you took the time to get to know Julian from his thankfully many and rich postings, you'd realize how silly and shrill your implied accusations are. He's nothing if not fun, entertaining and always charming. Qualities you not only lack but sadly seem incapable of appreciating. He's also noble enough to actually sign his name as opposed to some vague pseudonym but pointing that out might be a bit too obvious. Oh what the hell. The fact that you posted from a nickname with no history and you made no attempt to introduce yourself paints you as a coward so slink back to the anonymous electronic void from whence you came.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2003, 10:05</p><p>At a carol service last night, arranged by the Salvation Army, in an Anglican church, with a wind band from a Roman Catholic school (as well as the SA band). I had a good view of the school band, and there were two young (too young, maybe 14 or 15) trumpeters with potential. One was slim with good posture; short black hair and black  wire frames with a moderate minus Rx; the other less slim, fairish, also black wire but quite strong plus. Both pairs of specs were sort of oval - but they were different from each other. Anyway, the myope especially looks as if in five or six years time he might be highly desirable. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2003, 09:54</p><p>Another update on one of my neighbours whom I've mentioned a few times before, the elder of two good-looking young brothers who live round the corner. The other evening as I was getting into my car out on the street the two of them came down the street, walking one behind the other; John first and Andrew a bit behind. John (the elder and spexy one) said 'Hi' as he passed; Andrew (whom I know better as he's in business as the local window cleaner) passed a remark about the weather as he turned into a side street...John went straight down the street. Anyway, I did actually get a glimpse of John's left lens as he passed and it's low plus with some cylinder. I did catch sight of him in the street bareyed the other week, but that's really unusual these days. He's tall and thin with black hair and beard, fairly high colour and these round gold wire specs. A lovely sight when I do see him which is seldom. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2003, 23:50</p><p>A friend of mine (mow dead) used to say Tuesday was gay night at Sainsburys, but I thought the other day I'd found spexy guys' night at Tesco...there was a guy I know by sight from the pub, pushing a trolley on his own: solidly built (might be a rugby player), black hair, high colour, round wire frames with tinted lenses, substantial minus prescription...then another with his wife or girl friend, fair hair, designer stubble, rimless specs, lowish minus...and a slim guy with dark hair and a wife or whatever, black wire frames shaped like some half-eye readers, a bit down his nose and he seemed to look over the some of the time - but they were low minus too. I managed to observe him for about five minutes up and down the aisles and he was worth observing... </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2003, 15:41</p><p>Updates on a few of the guys I spot and jot from time to time. While waiting for the train to London (see my previous jot) I noticed the guy who is sometimes in the ticket office and sometimes out on the platform. I've mentioned before that he seemed to wear his minus glasses at the counter but not for the long-distance work on the platform. This time he was out on the platform, but wearing them - brown wire oblongs. Wondered if they're new and if he's passed the point of no return and is now a fulltime wearer. (Thought he was a bit slimmer; certainly a hunk). Then there was the guy in the refreshment room - slight, wide mouth, snub nose. On this occasion he wasn't wearing glasses which is unusual; but another day I was at the station I spotted him just going off duty wearing his usual round gold frames with low minus lenses. </p><p>Then there's the sexy spexy postman. For ages my letters have been delivered by a chubby guy with a goatee beard who wears shorts in hot weather. Delivers efficiently though quite late but nothing to write home about (no glasses). Several times recently, though, the letters have landed on the mat around 07.00, and that's sent me to the window to confirm that it's Him: tall, good posture, minus lenses in wire frames, dark hair; but in the recent cold weather he's been wearing a cap and I can't be sure if he still has his long pony-tail...if he has he's wearing it inside his coat. </p><p>'Philip' (the young guy up the street with the strong plus specs) has been driving a car once or twice recently. Newer than mine I'd say. And the other day I was driving up the road when I recognized his back. He was with a group of youths, wearing his pebbles as usual. </p><p>Finally there's my assistant: 43 and getting more and more dependent on his glasses whenever he has to read anything. They are readers; he can't see any distance with them; but I investigated them a long time ago (when he could still leave them lyign around) and discovered some cylinder in one lens and more plus in the other. I just wonder how long before he turns up with bifocals and how long after that before he's in specs full time. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2003, 15:38</p><p>AGES since I jotted properly...the other week I had a London trip, and besides the scenery at the station (see another jotting) there were two nice sightings on tube trains: </p><p>1. A tall handsome guy, scruffily dressed: torn jeans, trainers, an anorak and the silliest baseball cap you ever saw: pale blue with white spots. He took it off once revealing short, neat black hair which matched his beard (also short, just a bit more than designer stubble). His complexion was dark - whether he was coloured or just very sallow it would be hard to say. His glasses, however, were very dressy: semi-rimless with brown plastic frame and minus lenses. </p><p>2. A slim pale guy, Mediterranean-looking. Black hair, shortish; brown eyes. Dark blue business suit; shirt and tie. Black frames with a low minus Rx. Very nice indeed. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2003, 03:51</p><p>The more I think aout that guy in Teco last night the more improbable his glasses seem. they belonged to a different generation, a different era; but there they were.

Very peculiar. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2003, 23:14</p><p>Nipped into an all-night Tesco late last night to get some things I was out of and remembered they're supposed to stock my favourite blend of Scotch (Black Bottle). They don't, or at least that branch doesn't, but at least I got to talk to the guy who was stocking the shelves: tall (maybe 6'2"), slim, wavy black hair, high colour, glasses. And what glasses! Round black frames, heavy plastic. Lenses r-e-a-l-l-y S-T-R-O-N-G, lots of power rings, maybe -12 or more, I don't know, but not all that thick. Blue tint. Edges didn't stick out but then the frames were massive. Guess he thought if he had to wear the things he'd make a statement with them, but does he always wear them, I wonder? Although he was good-looking I wouldn't have looked at him twice - well, not three times anyway! - if he'd had contacts in. Tinyeyes would have gone berserk (to name but a few). </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2003, 03:50</p><p>Such a tantalizing glimpse this morning. As I turned a corner in the car, a group of young guys going into an office, mostly in jeans and fleeces, I think. One of them - tall, short brown hair, wore round wire glasses, plastic covered. The only view I got was from behind and to the side, but he looked unbelievably sexy. My impression was that the lenses were strong plus, but I could have been totally wrong. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;21 Oct 2003, 09:59</p><p>A good day for jottable sightings. Left the house this morning to find my drive two-thirds blocked by a large Royal Mail van; no sign of the delivery man and not quite enough of a gap to get my car out. After a few minutes the guy came hurrying from the corner (and I was a bit of with him!). he was wearing plus glasses well down his nose, and looked over them to speak to me; but rather to my surprise drove off still wearing them - I'd assumed they were readers. Off that. A little later as I drove down the High Street there was a small group of people chatting. One of them was a tall well-built youth with long blonde hair, a high colour, and glasses - oval frames in black wire and I couldn't be too sure of the Rx but I think it was substantial and minus. Later in the day went to visit a friend in hospital. As I went in, by the door opposite the medical school entrance, a group of students crossed from the medical school to the hospital, a girl and three guys. One of the guys was Asian and wore oval-ish black wire frames with a minus Rx. The second was also coloured but much lighter: wavy black hair and gold frames with very strong minus lenses, might have been plano-fronted. he was just gorgeous. The third was also very good-looking: white, with straight brown hair and semi-rimless specs, low minus. Shortly after that I passed another Asian student (I guess) in the corridor; he grinned and passed the time of day. He had black ovals, moderate minus. </p><p>Reflected on the prevalence of myopia among students. Of course hyperopes of that age might not be full-time wearers - but ALL the students I saw (except the girl) wore minus specs. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2003, 17:59</p><p>Went to my local for a pint this evening - first time for ages I've been there on a Saturday 'cos I've bee using another watering hole. The England-Turkey match was on TV and the place was crowded. There was a family party including two boys of about 8 (identical twins I should think), dressed similarly both with quite strong plus glasses. Wondered idly if identical twins have identical Rxs and if they change specs. Frames were the same as far as I could see. As usual on a Saturday quite a lot of guys from the local rugby club. Chatted to one guy I know, while wondering if my favourite rugby player would come in - aged 40 but looks about 27, fairish hair, rimless specs, -3 or so, puts in contacts to play but can't tolerate them longer than that ::))). Eventually he appeared with his wife; he'd obviously been home to shower and change. Smart check shirt, smelling of shower gel, NEW GLASSES (or at least a pair I hadn't seen before) - still oblong rimless, but very elaborate temples, and I wondered if the lenses were a tad stronger. Another of the rugby players whom I don't know wears s-t-r-o-n-g minus glasses, about 3/8 of an inch at the edge. Wonder if he goes into contacts to play or just blunders round in a blur. He's no oil painting BTW. </p><p>A nice young man I know came in - thought I must have a word when the match finished. The landlady called over, would I have a drink with Sam? Sam's only blemish is that he doesn't wear glasses - tall, nice slim figure, clear complexion, and now he's grown a bit of a beard which doesn't look too bad. Straight ::( </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Oct 2003, 01:10</p><p>K.E.V. - I've been looking for the pics of Peter Phillips; I was sure I'd posted them on one of the 'Guysglasses' Yahoo groups, but it seems I haven't. Maybe they were on one of the groups that closed down a while back. I'll post some on Guysglasses3 when I have time. I have two from the time of the Queen Mother's funeral and one the previous Christmas at Sandringham; some more recent ones. A few taken at a party in black ovals that do not flatter him! Most of them were on Rexfeatures - but all you can get there these days is thumbnails. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>K.E.V.</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2003, 19:19</p><p>Julian: </p><p>I came to see the pic of Peter Phillips but could not find them.  I have two of him wearing his glasses, and was wondering which one's you had.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Oct 2003, 09:42</p><p>From time to time I've mentioned a young colleague (whom I don't see very often - two or three times a month maybe) with close-cropped hair and white wire ovals with a minus Rx that's stronger than it looks at first glance. Anyway, when I saw him a few weeks ago one temple of his specs had broken off (but he was keeping them on pretty successfully) and he said he was waiting for a new pair. The other day he turned up at a meeting in black wire oblongs which (to me) changed his appearance and image completely. As we left after the meeting I commented on them and he said these were the free (or very cheap) second pair. He had paid over £300 for a smart rimless pair and the big, expensive chain opticians had made them up wrong. He couldn't see properly with his better eye and had taken them back to be put right - it sounded as if they'd used polycarbonate for one lens...but in any case the cheap and cheerful pair with CR39 lenses were giving him perfect vision. I said my experience is that family practices are always cheaper and better. We had quite a 'glasses chat' altogether...and I'll look forward to seeing the rimless pair when they're sorted out. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Oct 2003, 08:50</p><p>Another trip to London yesterday. As usual lots of specy guys around, many of them sexy as well as spexy. I'm mentioning only one: on the train back from London, which was choc-à-bloc, there was a young Asian guy a few seats away wearing black plastic frames with a plus Rx. When I left the train at Stafford he was getting off too, but had taken his glasses off; they were sticking out of his shirt pocket. He stood outside smoking a cigarette before boarding the coach for the next bit of the journey (no smoking on the coach or on Virgin trains) But he didn't put his glasses back on while he was in view. </p><p>Is he the exception that proves my rule that 'all spexy Pakis are myopes' or is he of another race? the latter is possible as he had fairly curly hair. I have a Tamil friend from Sri Lanka who wears bifocals with a plus Rx. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2003, 09:45</p><p>Lunch out in a country pub today, not one of my regular watering holes though I've been there before, and the food (lamb chops today, Ploughman's lunch the last time I was there) is great. Served at the bar today by a nice young man: slim, black hair in a slightly contrived quiff, shirt and tie, pleasant and well-spoken, ready smile. As if that wasn't enough, he wore glasses: black frames, ovals cut off at the ends. Might have been metal though they were a bit heavy to be called wire. Might have been carbon firbre I suppose. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2003, 10:02</p><p>Another sighting of the kid I call Philip (fair hair, roundish brown wire frames, strong plus lenses) - and I'm confused again! He was walking up the street yesterday with a guy of similar age, taller, fairer, pinker (in complexion) and better-looking - but with a definite likeness. Now, I ask myself, is this other guy (who wasn't wearing glasses) the one who used to appear sometimes in round gold frames and plus lenses that I thought was the same person? If he's studying or working away, or they both are; if they're brothers or cousins or something. The only way the question will be answered is if I see the tall one in glasses. Chance would be a fine thing. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2003, 16:32</p><p>...and a couple of glimpses today: </p><p>Stopped the car to let an oncoming car get clear on a narrow street with cars parked both sides. It was a cream-coloured Ford Fiesta, driven by a slim fair guy whose T-shirt and baseball cap matched the car pretty well. He wore round gold frames, tinted lenses, low minus I thought. Never seen him round here before. Hope I see him again. </p><p>Later in the day, stopped at the bottom of the street to let this guy cross over: tall and thin, black hair, sallow complexion (I don't think he was coloured but I could be wrong); oblong-ish black wire frames and a grey tint to his lenses. Very striking. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2003, 16:23</p><p>My other short break has been in Paris. Once again 'it' ws everywhere. I have an overwhelming impression that Parisian men choose their frames well - or perhaps there are very competent style consultants at the Paris opticians. </p><p>In the hotel where my friends and I were staying all the men on the staff (I wondered if they were all from one family) seemed to wear glasses. On the reception desk most of the day was a man in his 40s or 50s, black hair, receding hairline, black wire frames, plus lenses - nothing to write home about; but the other two! Later in the evening quite a nice younger guy, short black hair, rounded oblong black wire frames, minus lenses. Best of all was the guy who served breakfast and was sometimes on reception later in the day (it was B&amp;B; only): close-cropped black hair, nice face and figure, oblong-to-oval semi-rimless, low minus. married, but didn't half mince around the place sometimes! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2003, 02:35</p><p>Had a few days in London last week. As always lots of spexy guys, far too many to describe. Just a few of the outstanding ones: </p><p>In the house where I was staying, an Indian guy of 25 or so (Indian by race not upbringing which was thoroughly English, Essex accent and all). Shock of black hair, decent figure, strongish minus lenses in biggish heavyish oval gold frames. My guess is -5 or so - power rings and plenty of cut-in. His glasses were very obvious and (IMHO) not the best style for him. He'd be sensational in something black and oblong. </p><p>Went one morning on the London Eye. In the same capsule was what I took to be a family party: father, two daugters and a son. Dad wore gold-rimmed glasses with minus lenses, not too strong; son (slim, 18 or so, jeans and T-shirt) had low minus lenses in dappled wire frames. He was the only guy in the capsule worth looking at, so I looked when I wasn't observing London from above (the views are spectacular!). As you approach ground  level, they announce that you're goibg to be photographed; just after we had been I looked back at the youth to find he'd taken his glasses off and put them away - but where? He had no shirt pocket and I wouldn't care to put a pair of specs into a jeans pocket unless in a rigid case. Back on the ground, I watched briefly but he didn't put them back on. Nor was he squinting as he looked around. Funny. </p><p>Spent quite  a lot of time wandering around Covent Garden - lots of amateur entertainment there - and there seemed to be a rich crop of young men with plus lenses, mostly in oval wire frames. But the sighting of the week was a slim and well-dressed coloured guy in glasses that managed to be both semi-rimless and drop temples! (The semi-rim went below rather than above the lens.) I observed carefully to see if they were just shades, but there was a respectable amount of minification. That was definitely a first - and he was beautiful! </p><p>Changing buses on the way home (I'd parked my car out in the suburbs) I overtook a guy - didn't have time to look closely - in pale blue plastic frames; blue lamination, I thought, on a clear frame. </p><p>Today I've been back to London on business and I'm writing this on the train back home, where I seem to be surrounded buy short-sighted guys. The young man opposite me (untidy fair hair, Armani T-shirt, silver rings on right middle finger and left thumb, reading Volume 3 of The Lord of the Rings) has black metal semi-rimless, with the lenses screwed to the frame; decently strong minus lenses. Diagonally opposite another guy with untidy fair hair, but less contrived in style, fairly boring clothes. White metal ovals with quite strong lenses - near-plano base curve. Brown eyes and dimples, but definitely 'would have to be licked clean all over first'. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2003, 10:59</p><p>A couple of sightings this week of the guy I last mentioned six weeks ago: Andrew's brother John. Yesterday as I drove past their house he was leaning against the wall chating to a group of people; today as I drove up towards town he was cycling down in the opposite direction, pedalling like mad. Last time I said he was slim; thin as a rake might be more accurate. He's tidied his hair and beard up, and on both occasions he was wearing his glasses. He seems to be a full time wearer now, though they don't look all that strong - and I'm sure they're plus. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2003, 02:05</p><p>As I drove down the High Street this morning I passed a young guy (late teens/early twenties I'd guess) walking in the same direction I was travelling. Not so tall; dark hair, black T-shirt, light fawn shorts, small backpack. Round wire glasses, black covered, with gold temples. No clue to the Rx. he was reading something as he walked; might have been a map. Not a raving beauty in any sense, but a pleasant sight on a summer morning. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2003, 06:16</p><p>Called at Tesco quite late Saturday evening to get something for supper. Interested to see one or two spexy members of staff I've noticed before but not seen for ages. There was one lad with dark hair and very bad acne who was always particaulrly helpful when he was on the checkout: strong plus lenses in oval frames, dark brown or maybe plack wire. Then there was another with very blonde hair, nutcracker nose and chin like Mr Punch, and white wire ovals, minus Rx. Finally a youth I hadn't noticed before, who ws marking down the prices on stuff that was close to its sell-by date. Big, handsome head, fairish wavy hair, and a very cool pair of semi-rimless specs with a minus Rx. The disappointment was that when he went on to another counter he had a graceless shambling gait. The specs were superb though. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;01 Aug 2003, 05:57</p><p>I went out last night to catch the last post at the central sorting office - a wasted journey, as the last post is an hour earlier than it used to be, AND they don't have a stamp machine outside any more. I was in real Victor Meldrew mode ("I don't BELIEVE it!") as I drove home. There was one consolation though: as I approached a bus stop I spotted a good-looking guy with black hair, black designer stubble, and a black jacket, obviously listening to his personal stereo. It was only as I passed that I glanced that way again and realized he was wearing the coolest rimless glasses. No chance of guessing at his Rx - but he was a lovely sight! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2003, 13:29</p><p>Julian, I thought of you today - I did a London Euston to Manchester Piccadilly trip on Virgin Trains, but didn't see anything you'd consider worthy of posting for us here.  You must have a particular knack of spotting them.  Although I will declare I was travelling with a colleague with a substantial minus prescription (I'd guess it to be more than my ex's -5) and with an occasional, but curious, habit of looking over the top at things at close range.  He's early thirties in case anyone is interested in that last comment.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Jul 2003, 11:09</p><p>Oh, my dears, this hot weather! I've just seen 'Philip', whom I haven't mentioned for a while, sauntering down the street with two other lads. he was wearing shorts, trainers, glasses and nothing else... For a guy with fair skin and fair hair he tans up quite nicely. But those strong plus lenses look like a fire hazard with all this sunshine ::) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2003, 01:40</p><p>As I left home this morning quite early a young guy cycled past; I've jotted about him before. I don't really know him but I know his name is John. he and his younger brother Andrew moved out of the family home (just up the road) two or three years ago and set up house round the corner (that's something one might speculate about). I know Andrew fairly well as he does window cleaning in the neighbourhood and he's a friendly lad. I see John very seldom, and often on his bike as he was this morning - looked as if he might be on his way home from a night shift, but he was in proper cycling gear (but no helmet). </p><p>The two brothers are both tall (especially John, who is very slim - all that cycling perhaps) with black hair, and John has a beard these days. High colour, especially Andrew. I have never forgotten the rush of adrenalin the first time I saw John wearing glasses, and these days (though it has to be a few months since I saw him last) he is never without them: round gold frames, but I can't be sure abut the Rx. My first impression wass that it was low plus, but I never get a proper look; he's usually moving fairly fast. The last time I passed him on foot, he actually took them off and was cleaning them on his T-shirt as we passed...it can't have been deliberate; it must have been Murphy's Law ::)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2003, 09:46</p><p>To Tesco the other evening to look for bargains; got some too, a lot of stuff had been marked right down. A couple of sightings that were kind of cute, but too young to be sexy. First, two young blonde lads, brothers probably. The older one had a clear fair complexion and had obviously caught the sun, and his short blonde hair was sunbleached too. I'd have given him high marks for potential - he'll break lots of hearts in a few years - even if he hadn't been wearing glasses. Black wire frames, plus lenses, strongish. </p><p>A few minutes later another with similar colouring but less potential (fatter, less tanned) squarish black wire frames and minus lenses, quite strong for his age, maybe -4. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2003, 16:31</p><p>Down to the pub this evening for a couple of beers - my local, where I have hardly ever been on a Friday; the crowd varies from one night to another, but quite a few people I knew, and several conversations. Most notably with my favourite rugby player [who was with his wife ::( ] - if I didn't know he's 40 I'd put him at 27...as it is I'm still old enough to be his father. Youthful figure, clear complexion with a bit of a tan, shortish fairish hair, blue eyes, and the sexiest specs! Oblong rimless, white metal temples, ornamented, minus lenses. They don't look all that strong, but I know from a previous conversation (which I jotted at the time) that he wears contacts when he plays. He is just so attractive - and such a pleasant guy too. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2003, 07:14</p><p>...if indeed they are identical twins and not a narcissistic gay couple.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2003, 07:14</p><p>In ASDA yesterday, late afternoon, just one glimpse of the myopic identical twins I jotted about a fortnight ago. Looks as if Tuesday is their shopping day. Then several times passed a talish guy with short dark hair, polo shirt, jeans and tatty trainers. Mottled brown wire frames with REALLY STRONG plus lenses. Hard to guess the Rx - but glancing through the lenses everything was inverted. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2003, 05:56</p><p>The other sightings I promised... </p><p>Friday evening, shopping for bargains at Tesco (they mark down the prices of perishable foodstuffs that are close to their sell-by date) I noticed a very tall blond youth who was actually doing the marking-down on one aisle. I was some distance away when I first saw him, and thought, he just might be wearing specs. He just was! Squared-off oval gold frames and s-t-r-o-n-g minus lenses; my guess would be minus eight, but from the way the light caught them I thought they might be plano fronts. The rest of him?  Around six foot two or three; shock of fair hair which might have been sun bleached or might have come out of a bottle (highlights, I mean); slightly tatty black jeans and big clumsy trainers. But above all, a great big cheesy grin that appeared often. Getting closer and bagging a bargain, I could see he was a friendly, good-natured lad. </p><p>Sunday lunch time, having a bar lunch in a local hotel. A couple of tables away a young couple with a baby. The guy was up and down and in and out all the time - we got the impression he might have worked there in the past. He was thin, with a dark suit and a mauve shirt with a white collar of out-of-date cut and a matching tie, incongruously spiky hair, pale complexion, and strong plus lenses in black wire oval frames that didn't seem to fit him too well. Like most lens watchers I don't guess plus prescriptions very well (less practice?) but I guess he'd have been pretty blind without them. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2003, 04:31</p><p>Sorry, xxxx, I don't know, it's not a thing I've ever tried. But there are other people around who can recommend sites in North America that will probably post specs to the UK. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2003, 02:18</p><p>Julian </p><p> </p><p>If anyone knows the answer to this question, it is probably you.  Do you know of any sites that will supply specs to uk without having to supply proof of prescription, I heard someone mention something like americanglasses.com but I couldn't find the site. </p><p> </p><p>Any ideas? </p><p> </p><p>xxxx</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;01 Jun 2003, 08:07</p><p>Since you ask, Bellamy, it wasn't a private mansion. It's owned by the National Trust and hasn't been occupied as a house since before the second World War when it was a hospital...so maybe stately home was a misnomer. (But the gardens are magnificent and the display of rhododendrons was breathtaking). And I can't really claim to have been 'stalking' him either; it was more a matter of making the most of what glimpses I could get. </p><p>Two more sightings to follow soon. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bellamy</b>&nbsp;29 May 2003, 14:09</p><p>Julian, </p><p>You were stalking a young guy on the grounds of a private mansion? How risque`.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 May 2003, 09:06</p><p>I was walkling round the gardens of a stately home this afternoon, and my attention was caught by a guy who at first glance reminded me very much of a friend/colleague from another part of the country - who was, I knew going to be in the area today. A second glance, however, revealed several differences - but from some angles there was still an uncanny resemblance. This was a young guy of about 20 I guess, tall and thin, in jeans and a T-shirt, with rosy cheeks and a head of curly dark hair. His glasses were rimless. The edges were so marked that from some angles they looked like frames, but they were definitely rimless. My guess at his Rx would be around -6. Definitely a pretty sight for a raging optic obsessive queen! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 May 2003, 13:06</p><p>Called in to ASDA this afternoon to get a few things. My attention was caught by two guys, amazingly alike. Both tall and fairly heavily built; both in working clothes; both with black hair cut short, both with very similar glasses: metal fronts, coloured temples, both with a RX around -4, I guess. Identical twins? </p><p>As I took my stuff out to the car there was a young guy hanging about; decent figure, nice hair, dark wire ovals with a strong + Rx and maybe a good bit of cylinder with it. At first glance he looked a real beauty; but on closer examination he had very bad acne and, worse, a sour expression. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;22 May 2003, 13:49</p><p>My first trip to London for a while - lots of sightings; a few of them interesting enough to write down. </p><p>Rail travel round here is complicated at the moment because a section of the West Coast main line is closed for upgrading - till September! -and instead of boarding at Stoke I had to catch a replacement coach to Stafford, with the reverse process on the return journey. The train manager (what they used to call the ticket collector, with the guard's duties added on) was an enormously tall young man called Andrew, according to his badge, face nothing special, figure OK, nice dark wire specs with a respectable minus prescription. </p><p>Later in the day, talking to a friend while we waited on Notting Hill Gate tube station for a Circle Line train, was struck by a very good-looking youth on the opposite platform: black jeans, black T-shirt, about six feet tall with a lovely slim figure, dark hair, dark wire glasses, round I think. Couldn't get any idea of the Rx, but the overall impression was nice. </p><p>On the train back to Stafford (it was going to Liverpool; I'm used to Manchester trains) there were two interesting spexy guys at the far end of the carriage - managed to get a close look as we got off. One was tall with a mass of dark wavy hair; the other shorter with long dark hair in a pony tail and a beard. He was more myopic than the other; they both had black wire frames (lot of those about today it seems). </p><p>The star sighting of the day, though, was the guy sitting next to me till he got off at Rugby: medium height, blue jeans, mustard-coloured T-shirt, fairish hair cut short, five o'clock shadow, rimless specs with white metal temples, minus lenses about a quarter-inch thick at the edges, well-kept hands. He was reading a Dick Francis novel. Although he was gnerally nice-looking it was the glasses that made him for me, that and the fact that I could observe him fairly closely on and off for an hour. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 May 2003, 12:53</p><p>Today whilst on the tube I spotted a couple of young Pakinstanis, each with oval metal glasses.

Perhaps I shall get a closer peek at this pair next week. </p><p>Hugs and snugs, </p><p>Julian M.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 May 2003, 13:45</p><p>A couple of updates on guys I posted about in March. The one who kept taking his glasses off and putting them in their case: I've seen him two or three times lately and he's wearing them a lot more. I think my diagnosis was right: a first-time wearer who was having difficulty gettiong used to them but has now adjusted. Then there was the one with the shiny new-looking minus sixes that didn't seem quite strong enough. Saw him the other day - no glasses, no squinting. My guess that he usually wears contacts seems about right. </p><p>Some confusion in my mind, however, about the youth I call Philip. One day (in the middle of my enforced silence) I saw him, as I thought, walking up the street without glasses, wearing a striped football shirt. A bit later I passed near the house where he lives, and outside the door was the guy I had just seen, still bareyed, talking to a slighly shorter guy, very similar in appearance, but wearing the familiar round brown wire specs. That was two or three weeks ago; not a sign of him/them since. </p><p>HA! I'd written that much but not posted it, and this afternoon another couple of sightings of the 'bareyed version of Philip'. I am now pretty sure I couldn't have mistaken him for the spexy version with his spex off. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 May 2003, 01:57</p><p>As I've mentioned on another thread, my internet connection was down for nearly three weeks; hence the long silence. Just to get back into things, here's a sighting from yesterday. </p><p>I was on the way home in the car, and at the corner, just up the road from home, two tall Pakistani lads were standing talking in the middle of the road. I slowed down as I approached them, and they moved casually out of the way. Never seen either of them before as far as I know. The bigger one was examining something closely over the top of his glasses, which were biggish and roundish with a strong minus prescription. As I passed I glanced at the other, slimmer guy, and he was looking back at me through small completely round frames in black wire, with power rings very obvious. if they're new to the district I shall hope to see more of them. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2003, 10:52</p><p>While getting some bits and pieces at ASDA today lunch time, I noticed an assistant with spiky dark hair and black wire ovals with plus lenses. He wasn't particularly good looking, but had a slightly camp walk. While I was getting cottage cheese he came along the gangway to confer with two other guys who were stocking the shelves or something, and I got a good look at his glasses. They were stronger than I'd thought at first glance and had quite a bit of cylinder; in fact the distortion was such that for a moment I thought they were progressives...he was a bit young for that, but you never know these days. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2003, 00:26</p><p>Last August I posted about a younger colleague (early 40s) who had given up the struggle and was wearing his readers. He kept one pair at home and one at work - and I had (as one does) checked his glasses out when he wasn't around and discovered more sphere in one lens and a bit of cylinder in the other. Eight months on he no longer leaves a pair at work but keeps them with him and uses them a lot more. I'm intrigued at how quickly he's getting dependent on them for close work - but then there's obviously a bit of hyperopia and astigmatism there to start with. Bifocals next time? Full time wear in another year or two? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2003, 10:45</p><p>Called in at Sainsburys the other day for some coffee (they're quite dear but their ground coffee is the best value). On the way in spotted two guys, student sort of age, in jeans and black tops, one of them with glasses. On the way round got the odd glimpse: his frames were back wire ovals, his lenses minus, not high but enough to be worth wearing full time. Another guy shopping on his own, maybe a bit older, a bit over six feet, with black hair and short beard, high colour and much stronger minus lenses in oblong black wire frames. </p><p>Today (I've been away overnight) at Leicester Forest services on the M1, yet another nice looking guy in black wire frames with minus lenses. he was in black too, but his complexion was sallow but clear, and his frames kind of flattened ovals.  </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2003, 00:18</p><p>Also reminds me of catching a flight a few weeks ago. I swear I could've read the monitor even without glasses - I was so close to it - but a pretty girl queued alongside was squinting furiously at it. I'm not joking - but every time she looked at the monitor - she aged by 30 years!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2003, 00:15</p><p>Reminds me of the story of the two women. One of them gets glasses. The other one says "Nice - they hide your wrinkles!" The one with glasses says "Yes - and I can see your wrinkles so much clearer!"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Furtive</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2003, 16:03</p><p>I noticed a surprising new benefit of glasses wearing today.  Out driving I looked at myself in the rear view mirror and a certain forehead wrinkle that I've had for years seemed to have mostly disappeared suddenly.  I always thought this wrinkle made me look "throughtful".  I tried scrunching up my head to accentuate it, but couldn't find the right muscles (this was with my glasses on.   Of course I was stopped at a light while making faces at myself in the mirror.) Later I was walking around in a store and had taken my glasses off (still can't help it) and when I walked past a mirror the thoughtful wrinkle had returned.  And I understood then that what causes it is squinting.  Well, not exactly squinting in the sense that most people who squint make their eyes all little and slitty - actually my forehead works on making my eyes taller I think.  So it isn't a thoughtful wrinkle so much as a squinty wrinkle.  I wonder if the glasses places could sell more glasses if they'd illustrate this wrinkle-smoothing phenomenon. </p><p>While out shopping I went and hung around in one of theoptical places for awile, to watch people trying on glasses.  That was fun.  It was crowded enough that nobody would notice me and no sales people would bother me.  For awhile I watched a guy who was trying on what apparently were his first glasses.  He had a wife or girlfriend with him who was trying to push him toward certain styles and colors.  He was saying things like "let me look at everything first.  I don't know what I'm doing yet, so I can't zero in yet."  He was tall and thin with dark hair and light skin.  His wife had decent taste I thought - she was mostly steering him toward smaller, silver wireframes and drill-mount types while he seemed to be drifting over toward the rack of giant plastic aviator frames a few too many times.  In the end he picked some sort of rectangular coppery-colored wire frames with magnetically attached sunglasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2003, 05:24</p><p>Interesting one: this morning as I was driving up the street 'Philip' was walking down with another young guy: no glasses. An hour or so later he was at his front door with a few others: glasses on. After a while the group came down the street and passed my house: glasses still on (and they are strong!) To me this first sighting is a case of the exception proving the rule: specs off for football or whatever he's been doing; as soon as he got hom, back to normal. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2003, 22:57</p><p>Furtive: </p><p>No, your eyes won't relax into an endless decline; they will relax until you have glasses that correct the whole of your hyperopia. What you describe is perfectly normal. If you go to the bottom of this page and click 'View all posts' you'll find a classic description by John, posted about three weeks ago. My guess is you are less hyperopic than he is (+4). Sounds to me as if you're well on the way to being a happy full time wearer like him (and me). Well done! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nic</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2003, 22:47</p><p>Furtive - here's a mid-way position you could try - there's a girl at work who's a hyperope,about thirty, shoulder-length blonde hair. I can't estimate Rxs easily but glasses appear to have a respectable amount of magnification. She puts them on when she comes in and doesn't take them off till she leaves the office.  I thought this was odd at first because I thought that magnifying lenses were for reading, but she can obviously either see better with them on or doesn't really need them for distance but, like you, is sick of the on and off routine. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Furtive</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2003, 19:06</p><p>Alright Julian, I'm not recoiling in horror at the thought of a stronger prescription, but I'm curious as to how my eyes will know when to stop "relaxing."  If I feed them a stronger prescription, will they just relax into that too and continue on  some endless decline?   </p><p>I've had a mostly bespectacled week.  It's been very convenient not to have to carry my glasses around, always fishing them from their case or some pocket where they shouldn't be in the first place.  But, after wearing glasses most of the day I've been noticing that if I take them off for awhile things get a little fuzzy pretty quickly, and my eyes start to get a little teary.  In the past if I didn't wear glasses all day my eyes would start to get tired around evening and things would start to go fuzzy.  These last few morning I've had the fuzzy, tired experience almost as soon as I've woken up, so this morning as I was walking around making breakfast and such I put my glasses on and had the experience of everything around me suddenly being much clearer.  That was somewhat fun and startling simultaneously.   My prescription now is +1.75, -.75 left, +1.25, -.5 right.  Is this enough to really cause these symptoms, or do you think I am imagining/exaggerating my vision problems as part of my whole pre-existing glasses fixation? </p><p>It wasn't as hard as I though to keep the glasses on, especially once I got through a few face to face conversations and didn't let myself take them off.  After the first few days I felt more like I was seeing THROUGH them, rather than that I was IN them, which is how I've always felt before.  A few people have commented.  Since in the past I always whipped off the glasses when anyone approached I guess some of them hadn't realized I wore glasses at all, so I got those "oh, you got glasses" comments that newbies get.  The woman who had said before that she was going to be like me and wear her glasses only when she had to also commented that I was wearing glasses all the time now.  (I said no, I'm not, my eyes are just tired today....  ) </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2003, 09:41</p><p>Needed two or three items this afternoon and the nearest supermarket was Kwik-Save where I don't often go. On my way round noticed a member of staff: tall, nice slim figure, short tidy hair, high colour and glasses. He was working with a barcode reader and  a clipboard, and wearing a grey shirt, so I imagine he was more managerial than the red-shirted assistants. As I passed he looked up to answer a customer's query and revealed semi-rimless specs with really strong minus lenses. I had a (genuine) query of my own so I took it to him and got both barrels. Judging by the minification (rather than edge thickness which wasn't all that much) they must be around -8. Nice-looking young man, pleasant and helpful, and 'spectacularly' myopic. Quite made my day. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2003, 09:33</p><p>Furtive: no, your vision hasn't really altered; BUT it's possible that by wearing your glasses more you have encouraged your eyes to relax a little bit more than they have done so far. What I think you should do is go on wearing them full time, relax your eyes properly, and then have a test which will probably result in a stronger Rx. Don't recoil in horror from this idea; it'll mean better vision and greater comfort in the long run. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2003, 14:29</p><p>Talking about reaching for your glasses when you're already wearing them. Not long ago I decided to strip down my specs and give the frames a lenses a darn good cleaning. As I have a good -2.25 of astigmatism - it made sense to wear a back-up pair while I did the job. And when I had my specs re-assembled and shining like they were brand new - I promptly put them on - right on top of the ones I was already wearing!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Furtive</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2003, 14:05</p><p>David:  sorry, so far as I know there's no bespectacled photo of me in existence.   </p><p>Julian and others, thanks for the encouragement. </p><p>So far today I am still wearing glasses (it is the end of the workday here.)  Good chance I can make it through the rest of the day because I am expecting only to go home this evening and see no one - so no self consciousness unless I pass a mirror.  Still this is a whole different thing than if I was seeing friends and family.  Not so sure glasses will stay on in that case yet. </p><p>But today I have a new issue:  I've been trying the glasses fulltime project for 4 days in a row now actually, most times lasting at least half the day.  But today a couple of times as I worked on my computer I had this thought of "oh, I should put my glasses on" - only to realize they already ARE on.  This feeling was coming from my perception that the screen is a little blurry - as it is when I'm not wearing glasses.  I can consciously focus it back to normal, but I don't normally have to do that. Surely 3 or 4 unusually glasses-intensive days have not somehow altered my vision, now have they? If so then maybe I should stop and let things go back the way they were.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2003, 16:48</p><p>Furtive,  </p><p>This is a very good start.  </p><p>Do as I say, not as I do: I recently went to an initial meeting with a potential new client, and I argued with myself about whether to wear my glasses or not, and ended up not. It was just supposed to be a meet and greet. </p><p>So naturally they stuck a 500+ page stack of project reports and charts in front of me and started probing about how long the project - I'd never heard of before - should take.  </p><p>This was the first time I realy grasped just how hard it has gotten for me to read well without them - the words all had double edges and I constantly lost my place. I ended up gesturing at the giant size of the documents and taking them all home. For some reason I couldn't seem to bring myself to put on my glasses mid meeting. I guess for me its not putting them on and off, it's putting them on or not.  I still feel funny wearing them around old friends who've not seen me in them yet.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Furtive</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2003, 16:19</p><p>Bob, thanks for the message - it is good to know I'm not the only one who's ever had this "problem."  Ok, so I do want to try being a fulltime glasses wearer (at least I think I do.)  I tried today to do what you're all saying (put them on, leave them on!)  I got about halfway through a day, so better than before anyway.  I kept them on in front of coworkers, then in 2 business meetings (resisting a strong temptaion to take them off!)  Strangely, it seemed to me that I was getting better eye contact with people than usual.  But later in the day I had a dentist appointment and as I walked into the office I took them off and put them in their case.  That's when I had the sensation things were looking a little weird.  But, I didn't put back on my glasses until about 2 hours later.  So, so far today it has been about 3/4 of the time....  Is that a good start or am I still being a coward?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2003, 09:00</p><p>Jules! </p><p>I remember the last time you sat on them!  </p><p>My mother always had a rule: don't leave wire hangers on the bed - you could put an eye out. We should extend that to don't leave you glasses sitting on the bed, or you might not see the wire hanger! </p><p>I was going to generalize by saying: nothing hard on the bed, but then ...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2003, 23:31</p><p>I had a few hours of the 'on-off' thing the other day. On Friday night when I was away (see my previous post) I managed to put my glasses down on my bed and then sit on them - there wasn't a chair in the room. One lens popped out and the frames were buckled. I did the same thing a few years ago in a hotel bedroom in Malta, but on that occasion I had my old specs with me; this time all I had was a pair of readers. I coped reasonably well; my distance vision isn't too bad, but forget about reading anything bareyed, so on Saturday morning I went hunting for an optician's - regular specs in the case that belongs to the readers, readers hanging from my shirt. They said the repair would take twenty minutes or so, so I wandered round the shops. There were plenty of charity (thrift) shops, so I rooted round them. The bookshelves were a problem - titles were too far away for the readers, and I couldn't read the titles without them. Never mind, I got my proper glasses back pretty quickly and headed back to my lodgings. A good number of spexy guys to be seen, but more memorable than any of them was a tall young man who was walking along looking around him - and wherever he looked he squinted. I wonder if he knows he's short sighted...or maybe he has glasses but doesn't like wearing them. It's fun to spec-ulate ::) </p><p>Furtive: think of taking them off as a bad habit you have to break, like biting your nails or picking your nose. Follow Bob's method: decide you'll keep them on for an hour, then another hour, then all day... You know it makes sense. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2003, 20:37</p><p>Furtive: </p><p>I went through the same thing. I had always wanted to wear glasses, but when I finally got them I kept taking them off and putting them on. I would take them off anytime anyone approached and went through that for about six months. </p><p> My wife (ex-wife now) even said 'why don't you just wear your glasses instead of taking them off all the time.' Finally I decided it was silly and that I wanted to see what it was like to wear glasses all the time, at least for a while. </p><p> So, one night I decided I would not take my glasses off for one day, just as an experiment. The next day I put them on as I got out of bed and didn't take them off all day. Every time I started to take them off, I would force myself to leave them on. At the end of the day, everything looked wierd when I finally took them off and I decided to do it again the next day. That was 10 years ago and I have worn them all the time since then. Now, I feel naked if I take them off. People say I don't look like myself without my glasses.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2003, 17:47</p><p>Don't ever remember such a long serious discussion on this thread, and it's quite fascinating! Excuse me if I jot from time to time ::) </p><p>Down to the South Coast for the weekend - my nephew got married on Saturday. At the ceremony (register office) and the afternoon reception, three spexy guys, all myopes: one with black wire oblongs and a moderate prescription; one with oval semi-rimless and a dioptre or two more; the third with quite strong lenses in heavyish dark brown plastic frames, slightly almond-shaped. </p><p>The sightng of the day, however was a barman who appeared two or three times when we were in the ground floor bar while we waited to go upstairs for the reception - I think he came from another bar to draw a beer that he hadn't got there. he was very slim, with striking blonde hair (might have been sunbleached, might just have been highlighted) and dark wire frames with really powerful plus lenses in them. Possibly some cylinder, but I never saw him for long enough, he was always on the move. Tantalizing - but lovely! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Graeme</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2003, 11:49</p><p>My advice - when you go away for a week or so wear them all the time.  You won't feel self-conscious about them because you won't know anybody and by the time you get back you'll be so used to them you won't want to do without.   </p><p> </p><p>This is how I finally got into full time wear.  Like you, I was really conscious about glasses and even though I really couldn't see well enough without them I would only wear them when I absolutely had to (driving, tv, etc). When I was abroad in the summer I was struggling to see.  I was away with my best mate, he knew I was struggling to see but was very conscious about my glasses.  He persuaded me that it would be a good idea to where them more and that as nobody knew me I there I wouldn't have to bother about what people said.  By the time I went back I was so used to wearing them that I did not feel conscious of the specs anymore.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Furtive</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2003, 10:51</p><p>Yeah you'd think it'd be as easy as that, wouldn't you?  Especially for an admitted OO such as myself?  But it isn't.  I have been able to wear glasses all the time at places where people don't know me yet, as someone suggested.  That goes pretty well.  I was at an art gallery recently and ran into someone who had been in a course I took awhile back.  He didn't seem to recognize me so I introduced myself and said I remembered him from the course.  He said "ah, yes - you used to wear glasses, didn't you?"  In the course he used to wear glasses too, but didn't have them on that night.  I have told my family quite awhile ago that I got glasses, but haven't ever worn them when visiting them.  They have commented "so when do we get to see these glasses?" but I have not worn them around them yet.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2003, 08:47</p><p>Put 'em on - Leave 'em on - It's as simple as that!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2003, 07:33</p><p>Hi Furtive, </p><p>I always percieved that the on &amp; off routine was more common for a presbyope, since they can't see well in the distance with thier glasses on.  </p><p>One good time to start (more or less) full time wear is when you start a new program, (class, job, whatever) the new people won't know anything is different.  </p><p>I did this when attending a summer class a couple of years ago. One time I got distracted when taking off my sunglasses and forgot to put on the reglar ones - and one of my classmates immediately started probing to see if I'd gotten contacts. </p><p>Try keeping them on all the time at work. You can take them off to go out to lunch or for other non-visually intensive activities if you like. It also is nice to have prescription sunglasses if you've got the budget, and I think you'll scratch them less if you handle them less.  </p><p>Now that this other girl has gotten glasses, you can let her be the on-off person. Is she still? What is your prescription?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mattp</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2003, 05:19</p><p>Furtive-- </p><p>Yours is an interesting story.  I found just the reverse to be true--taking the glasses on and off made me more self-conscsious and uncomfortable.  With full-time wear, they became second nature.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Furtive</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2003, 19:46</p><p>When I was a kid I always watched that progression to fulltime wear with other kids' new glasses with great interest and jealousy.  I really wanted my own glasses but sadly never needed them.  In my late 20s when I was having trouble with headaches and eye-strain due (I reasoned) to my extremely vision-intensive, detail oriented career, I went to the eyedoctor and was prescribed glasses for hyperopia and astigmatism.  It was explained to me that these glasses would help a lot with my close-up eye-strain troubles but might also help with everything else too  - but it was up to me when to wear them.  So I started the perpetual on-again-off-again glasses routine.  This was complicated by the problem that - while I'd always wanted glasses and was secretly happy to legitimately need them - I was extremely (inreasonably) self-conscious.  I got very good at this putting the glasses in their case thing - as soon as anybody would appear to speak with me for instance, off would go the glasses.  A coworker of mine appeared one day with new glasses.  She said "I'm going to do what you do and only wear them when I have to."  Somehow this embarassed me, as I realized it meant that others were noticing what I was doing.  I guess I believed before this that they didn't notice I wore glasses : )  A few years later when I was at the eye doctor I received a somewhat stronger prescription and this time the doctor said that  my distance vision is significantly improved by my glasses, and while it is up to me what I do that he would think that wearing glasses all the time would make me more comfortable and be more convenient.  So I tried it.  And he is right about the difference in clarity.  But, I seem to have fallen hopelessly, endlessly into the off-and-on-again glasses pattern and can't break it no matter what I try.    Some combination of feeling self conscious, uncomfortable, weird, maybe a litle bit "old" - all are keeping me now from becoming the fulltime wearer that I always wanted to be when I was a kid.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>mattp</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2003, 06:50</p><p>That school scenario for wearing glasses may be very typical. But I was forced to do otherwise. Many years ago when I first got glasses in 5th grade, I was told not to wear them except to see the board.  The optom thought wearing them more than that would increase myopia. being the only one in my family to wear glasses, i was trapped--my parents concurred, and the teacher agreed.  I was forced to always take them off when there was nothing on the board!  What a pain--i wanted to just keep the fool things on.  It was  embarrassing to just keep fiddling with them.  Finally, in 7th grade, my RX was strong enough to just wear them all the time--what a relief!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2003, 23:27</p><p>With some schoolkids - the fear factor counts for a lot. When I started school - a fried of mine showed up in thick plus glasses at the age of 5. His mother brought him into the school wearing them - and told the teacher to make sure he wore them all the time. Poor kid was purple with embarrasment and rage - but Mother had spoken - and Teacher was there to enforce the order!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bob</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2003, 20:31</p><p>It always amazed me when I was kid the number of friends and classmates who would get glasses, complain furiously that they would not wear them, then follow the scenario that's been outlined here and before long glasses would be a permanent part of their faces. It always seemed to me that it was inevitable if you got glasses you would eventually show up wearing them all the time. I remember one close friend who swore up and down he would only wear them in class. But within days he was forgetting to take them off between classes. Soon he was wearing them all day at school and within weeks was wearing them all the time and even had them on in the school picture that year. </p><p>After I turned 40 and started wearing glasses myself, I discovered there is another time when wearing glasses full time seems inevitable. That's when people start needing reading glasses, get strong reading glasses for a year or two until their close up vision gets so bad they absolutely can't read without glasses. Then they go to eye doctor who says they also could use a little distance correction and prescribe bifocals. Most people I have known in this situation (like me) have ended up wearing them all the time. I know a 47-year-old woman who bought drug store readers for years until she couldn't see even big print close up and went to the eye doctor. She was prescribed bifocals and says she liked the fact that she didn't have to keep taking them off and putting them on all through the day. She is never without her glasses and seems so natural wearing them that I was surprised to learn she didn't put them on until she was 45.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jo</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2003, 12:52</p><p>Working in a school I see quite a lot of this scenario, especially with youngsters around age 12 or 13. </p><p> </p><p>Week 1: Teacher notices kid can't see board; writes a note to parents suggesting an eyetest.  Kid moans that they can see OK. </p><p> </p><p>Week 3: Kid furtively puts on new glasses when everybody is looking at the board and takes them off again as soon as they have finished reading it.  At break time other kids try on the glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>Week 4: Student realises that they need the glasses and the glasses are put on as a matter of routine when something is written on the board. </p><p> </p><p>Week 6: Students realise that eveything is clearer with the glasses, so they are put on at the beginning of the lesson, taken off at the end, student walks down the corridor and puts repeats this performance in the next class. </p><p> </p><p>A few weeks later:  Students realises that it is silly to take glasses off to walk 100 metres down the corridor, so glasses stay on during change over in lessons but go back into their bag at break/lunchtime. </p><p> </p><p>Not long after: Students arrives bare-eyed, but glasses go on at the beginning of the first lesson and stay on for the rest of the day, sometimes coming off at hometime.  From there it's not usually that long until they start to come in wearing glasses and wear them full time. </p><p> </p><p>I've seen this pattern numerous times over the past few years.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2003, 07:46</p><p>Hmm. Here's a scenario somebody posted a few years ago: </p><p>Week 1: I'm not seeing so good but I don't want to wear glasses. </p><p>Week 2: I'm going for a test, I hope I don't have to get glasses. </p><p>Week 3: I have to get glasses but I'm only going to wear them to see the board in school/for driving/at the movies. </p><p>Week 4: I got my glasses; I kept them on all day cause it was a nuisance taking them off and putting them on. </p><p>Week 5: I'm wearing my glasses all the time, I just love the clear vision. </p><p>Those are the stages for a lot of people, aren't they, though the week is sometimes a bit more than seven days? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>PennNP02</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2003, 07:21</p><p>I've been reading the comments about myopes going through "stages" and eventually arriving at full-time wear. Although I am primarily a contact wearer, through many different sources, I'm realizing that giving my eyes a break from contacts (due to the oxygen deprivation to the cornea, and just general wear and tear) is a good idea. Although I've taken to wearing glasses more at work (hospital setting), I still am a bit self-conscious about the idea in that I think "What will I say if someone I know sees me with glasses?" And I'm still way too shy to wear them on social outings--I suspect I will stay with contacts for playing sports, working out and going out with my friends.  </p><p> </p><p>I guess getting older has diminished some of the vanity, because a few years ago there is NO WAY I would ever wear my glasses unless I was having a problem with the contacts (ie eye infection). So I'm a little bit proud of myself for progessing somewhat towards the path of "full-time wear". </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2003, 08:02</p><p>Another nice young couple at the office today. He was tall and thin, sallow, with untidy hair and oblong dark wire frames with strong minus lenses, maybe around -6. Looked fairly new; but when I pointed out something about 20 or 30 feet away, there was a distinct narrowing of the eyes, hardly a squint, but... Of course his specs could be new-looking because he only wears them when he wants a rest from contacts. Anyway, I predict an increase for him before long. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2003, 05:45</p><p>A few weeks back I posted about the booking clerk at the railway station who wears minus glasses when he's on duty at the desk...let's call him Craig. Yesterday he was on duty on the platform in a heavy raincoat - and bareyed. I'd find this puzzling (surely he'd want his specs for long distance work) but the German simulator we've been discussing on another thread reveals that short-sighted people don't see as badly as I'd have thought - little worse than I do without my low plus/cylinder combination. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Alan</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2003, 12:40</p><p>John - Did your prescription stay at +4, or has it changed more since then?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2003, 10:54</p><p>Hi, I'm 23 now.  I really can't see much without my glasses at all now.  I went full time in the summer of 1996; i think it was quite good to get used to full time wear over the summer holidays; by the time I went back to school I certainly could not have done without them. </p><p> </p><p>However, going full-time did lead my eyes to get worse quite quickly over the first year and I reached +4.00 within 18 months or so; I guess my eyes which had been straining for so long just relaxed and my vision got worse.  Now, I can't do close or distance without them, everything is just a blur and I get really bad headaches.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2003, 07:22</p><p>John, </p><p> </p><p>How old are you presently? Can you see close things at all without glasses now? Is it more than just headaches now? </p><p> </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2003, 03:32</p><p>John: Thanks for that very lucid account. If you were to give it a title it could be 'I was a teenage hyperope' ::) </p><p>Christy: If I were short sighted I'd have been like you and walked out of the shop wearing my first glasses and been a full time wearer from that moment. It seems the natural thing to do and I used to think all myopes didi it. I'm reminded of sitting in the gods in a London theatre - good grief, I must have been in my early twenties! - behind two guys who talked animatedly before the play and during the interval. When the curtain went up one of them put on a pair of REALLY STRONG minus specs (even then I knew what power rings meant) but in the interval he put them away. I was bemused, wondering as I still do how he could get around bareyed. </p><p>Incidentally Geoff who posted the other day on 'Acuity &amp; prescription' was a very active poster five years ago and gave a blow-by-blow account of the kind of theing you're talking about, from being afraid he needed glasses through getting them but wearing them no more than he could help to realizing it made sense to wear them full time and finally to urging other new wearers to do the same! It's all in the archives of the original polls that came before the last BBS; his recent post prompted me to look it up. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>John</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2003, 12:25</p><p>As you say Julian it seems likely that full time wear has caught up with your neighbour Philip.  I imagine that the new glasses mean that he's a full-time wearer.  Interesting to speculate on whether he decided to go full time when he got the new specs or was told to.  He seems a bit like me. </p><p> </p><p>I was getting a lot of headaches at school at the age of 13 or so and was prescribed plus lenses with the helpful advice I should wear them when I was doing close work, got a headache or felt like I needed them. </p><p> </p><p>At first I only really wore them for study.  After a year or so, I found that if i'd been doing a lot of homework and then I took my glasses off it was quite hard to focus properly, so when I was studying hard I would wear my glasses a bit more often, occasionally I would wear them if I was going out with my mates or to play soccer, etc, but I usually went around bare-eyed. </p><p> </p><p>By the time I 16 I had had a couple of Rx changes, but nobody had offered me advice on when to wear them.  I was not a full time wearer at this stage.  I was studying for my GCSE, so I would do several hours of homework most nights.  If I tried to take my glasses off after two or three hours of constant wear I got bad headaches, so if I was at home I would wear my glasses for the rest of the evening. </p><p> </p><p>From there it was a fairly quick step to full time wear.  I guess I got used to wearing glasses to watch tv etc in the distance and by the end of the exams I was finding distance vision hard without glasses and I was getting more headaches.  I booked an appoinment for a check up.  This time it was a different optician and when she asked how I was doing, and if I was getting headaches, I said I thought I need to go full time with glasses.  After doing the check up she said that full time wear was a good idea given my rx (+ </p><p>2.50).  As soon as I got my new glasses a week later I went full time and the headaches and eyestrain stopped; although my vision without glasses got worse quite quickly.  Now I'm a very happy full time wearer.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2003, 12:18</p><p>Julian - I've seen people do that sort of thing. They get glasses. They obviously see better with glasses. But they only wear them when they really need to see things. The rest of the time they walk round in a blur. Always seemed a bit daft to me. Sometimes they go on to become full-time wearers instead of all the on-off-on-off carry-on. But a few always resist - and to be quite honest - they never seem to be happy with glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2003, 07:35</p><p>During the wek or so i was offline there were quite a few minor sightings I might  jot about - but one I have got to share with everybody: </p><p>The other day a young married couple called to see me on business. I was engaged when they arrived so they waited. When I called them into the office the husband took off a pair of glasses - a new feature as far as I know though I hadn't seen the couple for over a year - and as they came in was putting them away in  a big new-looking black case with the name of Specsavers on it. Boldly (for me) I said, "Taking your glasses off so that you can see better?" and he said solemnly, "I can't see anything more than two metres away without them;" then he took them out again (they're white metal ovals with, I think, brown temples) put them back on and said, "That's better!" he wore them all the time we were talking, but when they got up to go he took them off again and put them back in the case which he held in his hand. This amused and intrigued me enormously - I'd be prepared to bet a small sum that when they got out to the car he took his glasses out of the case and put them back on. </p><p>My diagnosis? He obviously wasn't accustomed to wearing specs and was excessively conscious of them. His care in putting them away in  their brand new case bears this out. The 'two metres' bit suggested an optician's explanation rather than his own observations; people don't usually observe in metres. I wondered if this meant his Rx was -0.5 (though someone was saying on another thread that his Rx was -2 and he could see OK up to 10 feet bareyed). </p><p>I think I was watching the birth pangs of a new spexy guy. What does anyone else think? By the way he's thin with rosy cheeks, brown eyes and receding dark hair. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eddy</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2003, 18:39</p><p>I had a friend who had a stroke. Brain was perfect in every respect except he couldn't say names so he called everyone "Beverly". A possibility except it doesn't seem quite right in the context.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2003, 16:09</p><p>I had to call him something, so why not Philip? It isn't strictly true that I had to 'name' him, but it seemed more sensible as I expect to report the odd sighting until I establish whether he's gone into full time wear. Philip was just the name that came into my head. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nic</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2003, 13:36</p><p>Hey Julian, I'm new here so excuse me for asking, but why did you decide to call him Philip?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2003, 07:04</p><p>It's been a longish silence; I was offline for a week but am now back with broadband. Another sighting of the youngster I said I was going to call Philip: saw him in the middle distance the other evening, and again he was wearing his glasses. look as if full time wear has caught up with him - just wish I could get a decent look. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;21 Feb 2003, 05:26</p><p>I jotted some time ago about a nice young man with bright blue eyes behind minus lenses in gold oval frames. He called in the other day wearing squared-off brown wire frames and somewhat stronger lenses. Nice... </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2003, 04:36</p><p>Just come from a session wih a sports massage therapist about a  painful knee. The guy was slightly stocky, medium brown hair parted in the middle and longish, moustache, brown eyes. Mottled brown wire frames with tinted lenses: decently plus in the right and quite substantially minus in the left. Some people reckon with that kind of eyesight you've got the best of both worlds: one eye to see near, one to see far, no need for specs. But I guess this guy would need his minus lens to read with his left eye. Quite pleasant anyway. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2003, 14:48</p><p>On the train to London this morning, a tall young guy in a yellow anorak, blue and white striped shirt with white collar, tie; short but slightly untidy mid-brown hair, well-kept hands. Lovely specs: black or very dark squarish frames, might have been carbon fibre. -3? -4? </p><p>Passed through Dean's Yard (Westminster) twice - my first time there for ages. Late morning there was nothing to see. After lunch there were various senior boys from Westminster School moving from one class to another. Quite a few in glasses: all but one wire frames; all but one myopic. The exceptions were one in black plastic and one with strong plus lenses in oval gold frames. </p><p>As I walked along Victoria Street to Victoria tube station, there seemed to be more guys than usual squinting around to see. Or is it just my overactive imagination? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2003, 17:29</p><p>(Sorry about that; I hit the wrong key) </p><p>A youngster I know has shown up a couple of times recently in glasses - black wire ovals with low minus lenses. With his mop of straight blonde hair and blue eyes... At one point he took them off and put them down, lens surfaces on the table. I picked them up and found the lenses were quite badly scratched, so when I got him on his own I read him a lecture aout the proper care of specs. Asked how long he'd had them: "a while..." Didn't ask what had persuaded him to 'come out'; was he seeing better? "Yes, I'm slightly short-sighted." </p><p>Could have told you that, ducky. Shall watch your future progress with considerable interest. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2003, 17:17</p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2003, 09:29</p><p>Tried to get lunch in a pub today, not one of my usual ones, but the tables were fully booked. Barman was quite nice: slightly chubby with fairish hair; jeans and white T-shirt. Black wire ovals with a substantial plus prescription. </p><p>Talking of which I haven't seen hide nor hair of 'Philip' since I mentioned him last. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2003, 07:15</p><p>To the station yesterday to book up for my next London trip. Just ahead of me in the queue was a tall slim dark youth: longish black hair, brown eyes, nice figure. I wouldn't have given him a second look, though, if he hadn't been wearing a cool pair of glasses: slightly rounded oblong frames, black metal, a bit heavier than usual; minus lenses, strong enough to be indispensable. </p><p>When I got to the counter, my favourite clerk was on. High colour, fair hair which he has had close-cropped. Some time ago he started wearing minus glasses at the coutner (but not when he was on platform duty); this was a new pair, a bit stronger than before I guess, and looking like a fixture on his face (the previous ones were very narrow and looked camp for such a butch guy). </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2003, 23:14</p><p>Thinking back to my own youth: I wore my plus specs part time from the age of 18 to 28 or so, when an eye doctor shouted at me and said they were prescribed for a distance and I should be wearing them. But they were (and are) quite weak and have a bit of cylinder in them. </p><p>There's another spexy blonde lad around who's been wearing plus lenses (in boring gold aviator frames) as long as I've lived here (11 years plus) and until I saw the two of them together I was confusing them although they're not all that alike. Also an older guy, mid-20s at least by now, whom I have seldom if ever seen without his significant plus specs. </p><p>Of course cylinder and prism components would be significant, but I can't get that close ::) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2003, 22:42</p><p>Well, I've been seeing this youth around the district for maybe a couple of years, sometimes with glasses but more often not. I have a distinct memory of seeing him standing at his front door talking to somebody and wearing his glasses, as if he'd been wearing them to study, watch TV, or whatever. The lenses are not weak. As you say he may well have reached the point where he needs them to see in the distance, though I'd have thought he was there already, but maybe his optometrist told him.  </p><p>I'll report any more sightings. I have no idea what his name is but for convenience I'll call him Philip. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jo</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2003, 13:58</p><p>Jules, isn't it quite normal for youngsters with plus lenses to take to wearing them full time reasonably quickly?  As I understand it, when you are long-sighted the eye can accommodate quite a fair degree of uncorrected longsightedness, but once you start to wear plus lenses, the eye muscles start to relax which means (a) the patient finds it harder to do without their glasses full time and (b) the RX can increase quite quickly. </p><p> </p><p>If this is true it seems very likely that this guy will be wearing his new specs full time.  Let us know.  I always think plus lenses on teenagers are very interesting, makes a change from all those minus lenses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Jan 2003, 12:52</p><p>A follow-up to yesterday's No 3. I saw him on a street corner this evening in a group of teenagers, and he was wearing his glasses again. More when I see more. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2003, 18:13</p><p>A few sightings - glimpses from the car mostly, but jottable: </p><p>1. Yesterday, was it? As I was getting into the car at my front gate, two people coming up the street. I delayed long enought to get a look at the boy (20-ish I suppose); medium height, nondescript hair, a small backpack, listening to a personal stereo; but a clear fresh complexion and fairly low minus lenses. Never seen him before. Hope I see him again. </p><p>2. Definitely yesterday: walking this time, through the centre of Newcastle-under-Lyme; in the distance a tall slim tanned youth with black or at least dark curly hair and black or at least dark-rimmed specs. No idea about the lenses - but he was sexy. </p><p>3. The other day, passed three or four youths as I was almost home. One of them was one of the spexy blonde boys from up the street (I've mentioned them before but not recently) the less lanky and more attractive one, who doesn't wear his (plus) glasses very often (or didn't). Anyway, he was wearing them this time, round wire frames, black or at least dark, in place of the gold that I thought suited him really well. I speculate whether he's wearing the new ones full time. I shall keep my eyes open and my glasses clean. </p><p>4. This morning as I was arriving home. Two young guys walking up the street on the other side, one of them rubbing his eyes and squinting hard, I mean really hard, eyes really screwed up. Contact lens slipped? needing but not wearing glasses? I don't suppose I shall ever know - but it's fun to speculate. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jeffrey Bottom</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2003, 12:55</p><p>Hi, Tony </p><p> </p><p>Well, I asked whether he would mind my taking a little time to see if I could adjust to them.  "By all means," he said, adding that he wouldn't have any trouble seeing with out them in such close quarters. </p><p> </p><p>Believe it or not, our PD's were identical.  His astigmatism was of the variety that elongated things which made it visually interesting for me.  I'm a minus 3.25 so they were a bit stronger than I'm used to.  I wasn't drinking, but wearing them was a bit of a high.  (I go there for the comradery, not the booze.) </p><p> </p><p>When I moved my head the whole outer image around the bifocal portion seemed to move.  That was kind of a trip.  And, I was able to read with them on. Considering it was my first experience with progressives, it went very well.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2003, 11:21</p><p>Jeffrey. How did you manage to keep the glasses on for so long. Did the guy seem to want them back?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2003, 08:57</p><p>I was in my local (in no way a gay bar) last night and as usual the local rugby club was there in force. My favourite spexy rugby player (aged 40, and married) was sporting a lovely black eye - I guess his right eye will be completely closed today. He told me quite cheerfully that somebody's elbow had gone into his eye - no malice, and no resentment on his part. What I'd have loved to ask, but didn't want to betray my interest, was whether it had dislodged a contact lens (he wears them when he plays). He is quite significantly myopic - I guess around -3 - and wears the most beautiful square rimless specs with rather elaborate temples. </p><p>Incidentally I overheard another guy in that group saying "I couldn't see the ball; I hadn't got my glasses." he wasn't wearing glasses in the pub either; but if there is one game more than another where they are a no-no, it's rugby. For players anyway. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jeffrey Bottom</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2003, 08:03</p><p>I was in a bar last night.  It happens to be a bar favored by mature men.  Age seems to take that false pride away, and many wear glasses which they never would have dared in their youth. </p><p> </p><p>Needless to say I couldn't take my eyes off this old bull I'd seen on one other occasion.  He's a regular visitor.  Mid 50's, nearly bald, with a prominant nose.  And, yes he was wearing glasses.  Very masculine, animated, and yet professional looking.  To me he was the most handsome guy in the place. </p><p> </p><p>The bar was full, and groups of guys were gathered chatting away as the piano player sang "Somewhere Over the Rainbow."  He was standing with a group of his buddies.  I wanted to meet his SO badly.  So, I positioned myself next to them, and listened as they told jokes and made fun of one another.  And, when the appropriate moment came, I joined their conversation.  This is so unlike me. </p><p> </p><p>Wouldn't you know, his name is John, and he is very nice.  I noticed he was wearing progressive lenses which allowed me to naively mention I'd had my eyes examined earlier in the day and that the optomitrist had recommeded my trying them.  I expressed concern about being able to adapt to them, and in no time flat he handed me his glasses.  I took off mine and put his on.  I'd guess they were in the minus four neighborhood with a load of astigmatism, and an add of about two.  I had them on for about half an hour.  Funny, while I was wearing them I sort of felt like I was John.  Not that I could hold court the way he does. </p><p> </p><p>They were an affectionate lot, John's crew.  But, I had to leave, and bid them farewell early on in the evening. </p><p> </p><p>I woke up this morning with, you guessed it, John on my mind.  His gorgeous nose, and beautiful bald head.  I think I'm falling in love.  If only I'd gotten his number.  Oh, well.  So, I'll be back to that bar again sooner than not. </p><p></p><hr>

The lack of pigmentation in the skin leaves them very susceptible to sunburn - and the wearing of dark shades outside is the norm. The one I know even has leather patches at the side of his shades so that stray light doesn't come in sideways.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 Jan 2003, 03:29</p><p>On another subject entirely, I wrote this while I was away this week: </p><p>I'm away from home for a few days as I write. The youngest member of the group I'm with is an albino  (is it still PC to call him that?)- mop of curly white hair (eyebrows and lashes to match), clear pink complexion, pale-coloured eyes which he rarely opens wide enough to reveal the colour. Squints at everything, and to read puts on gold-rimmed glasses with strong plus lenses and holds the book six to eight inches from his eyes - but when he has occasion to read something out he reads very fluently. I've also seen him reading with no specs, but using a powerful hand magnifier. Finally, out of doors he wears shades, which seem to be non-prescription. </p><p>This the first time I've been at close quarters with somebody with this condition; as I understand it it's a lack of normal pigmentation but I know there are often eye problems associated with it (I've heard albinos referred to as 'blind fair' in Scotland). Is the main problem photophobia caused by the lack of pigment in the irises, or is there more to it than that? Anybody enlighten me? OGL? Still with us, I hope. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eddy</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2003, 21:17</p><p>Fascinating stuff, p/f. Lingua franca is a small hobby of mine for various reasons and a lot of the words in the glossary certainly are consistent with it. But why? A lot of the others are straight "flash language" and thieves' cant. Also interested, Jules, that you can be "camp" and "butch" at the same time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pip Fry</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2003, 18:13</p><p>For gay slang, including the word 'camp', I found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132708/http://www.chris-d.net/polari/" target="_blank">http://www.chris-d.net/polari/</a> , <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132708/http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/polari.htm" target="_blank">http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/polari.htm</a> , and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132708/http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/staff/paulb/polari/home.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/staff/paulb/polari/home.htm</a> . The Occitan connection is fascinating, as generally are accounts of this weird English/Persian/Italian gay slang known as Polari.  </p><p> </p><p>All these pages have entries for 'camp', one of which is explained via 'Known As Male Prostitute'. I'd read that camp originated as exaggerated gestures to signal gayness in the 1920s, when for the first time it was socially possible to use these to indicate you were gay without immediately being picked up and cast into (Reading?) gaol.

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;14 Jan 2003, 15:25</p><p>Julian, your expression in the last post has me stumped.  "Camp as a row of army tents"?   Does that mean gay? I'm totally guessing here.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2003, 01:32</p><p>Driving (being driven actually) through a big village on the Staffordshire Moorlands the other day, just at the time the bus from the nearest town dropped the High School kids off from the nearest town. One cluster of three lads, sixth form or so, one of whom showed promise: clear fair complexion, shock of straight very blonde hair, and glasses: round gold frames with a significant minus Rx. Just  give him a year or to to go to college and get still more myopic... </p><p>In church on Sunday morning, three strangers - two guys and a girl, both the guys in glasses. One of them, tall, thin and bald though quite young, wore gold rimless roughly ovals with a low minus Rx. I gathered he was married to the girl. During coffee after Mass he took his specs off and put them in a case. The other guy was not likely to do that, I guess. Smaller, heavier, generally less striking. His glasses were blue wire ovals and quite strong (minus) with edge thickness on the sides. He was as camp as a row of army tents. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2003, 01:28</p><p>My car's electrics are on the blink, and I had to go yesterday to a spares shop to buy some parts. All I know about cars is how to drive them, and the guy had to come out to look at the car to check the right product, so he called for 'Paul' to come and mind the counter. Paul, when I got to see him, turned out to be a neat young man with very short hair, a nasty shaving rash, and a very smart pair of glasses with black plastic frames, something between oblong and oval, and a very definite minus prescription, -4 at least, maybe -5. I remember seeing him there back in October, at the time when several weeks' sighting got packed into one post and he was left out. I think he may have been wearing different specs then, but he was quite striking both times. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2003, 18:08</p><p>A cute guy about 18 years in the local supermarket has glasses with medium to small frames in dark wires. He is of slight build with blonde hair. They have to be at least minus 6 with a lot of protussion and cut-in. </p><p> </p><p>I noticd today he has gotten new smaller "micro" glasses. Dark wires with very high index lenses which make him look only mildly myopic. </p><p> </p><p>Shame about the advent of high index lenses. ( as far as OO's are concearned.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fathom</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2003, 15:21</p><p>My understanding is that because contacts are considered "drugs" (at least in the U.S. - though the movie itself was filmed in New Zealand), new wearers are advised to have an optometrist check their eye health to ensure that they are suitable candidates for contact lenses (e.g. seeing if they produce enough tears to sustain contact lens wear) and to monitor how they are adapting to the lenses. </p><p> </p><p>And if for some reason the movie needed more complicated contacts that are very difficult to fit, such as scleral lenses, an optometrist would also have been handy.  I doubt that long-time wearers needing run-of-the-mill soft or RGP contacts would've REALLY needed an optometrist.  You're probably right on that...in theses cases, an optician would've done just as nicely.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2003, 03:10</p><p>Right, that makes sense...but does it take an optometrist to fit contacts? Wouldn't a dispensing optician (or whatever the current term is) actually be better for that? I only ask because I want to know. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fathom</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2003, 01:27</p><p>I'm guessing that the optometrist was there to fit contacts for those in the cast who otherwise did not need them for regular correction (e.g. special effects for different eye colours).  I hesitate to be more specific for fear of spoiling the movie for those who haven't yet seen it.  I'd think that having an optometrist on hand would've been easier than having each actor who needed such contacts see an optometrist individually.  Those who wear contacts in real life anyway and are used to these things (Elijah Wood being one) were probably on their own. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

At LotR, watched the credits all the way through (but still missed seeing who played King Theoden) and noticed an optometrist on the list. Don't remember seeing that before, is it usual? With a cast that size, there must have been a lot of contacts needed; but surely actors usually make their own arrangements? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2002, 02:05</p><p>Dashed into Sainsbury's in the middle of Saturday afternoon to get a few items, mainly coffee. Several times passed a young couple with a shopping trolley (and this time I *wasn't* doing it deliberately). He was very handsome - just over six feet, slim, dark, rosy-cheeked and decidedly short sighted - lenses maybe -4 in black oval wire frames. When I got to the '10 items or less' checkout it was manned by a slim, friendly Chinese boy with gold wire ovals and minus lenses. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2002, 01:39</p><p>Went to Midnight Mass at a strange church, or at least one where I know only a few people. Not a big congregation but the organ ws augmented by an oboe and a trombone (and I love trombones in church, even better than trumpets!). The oboe was played by a fair-haired girl and the trombone by a tall fair boy of about 20 I guess: the real bonus was that he wore dark-rimmed glasses most, but not all, of the time. After Mass when everybody was milling around at the back exchanging Christmas greetings, one of my friends told me they were brother and sister; I could see they both had light blue eyes - but he was bareyed ::( ... the way he used his glasses suggested hyperopia/astigmatism - but who knows? some low myopes do funny things. </p><p>Later in the day, helping with a delivery of 'Christmas meals on wheels', I got no answer at one house, and asked the neighbours: two young guys, a girl and a dog, who couldn't have been more friendly and helpful (apart from the dog). I don't know what their relationships were, but the smaller of the two guys had rosy cheeks and really sexy specs with dull blue wire frames, obviously pretty new to judge by the fancy metalwork, and low but not too low minus lenses. Nice. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2002, 14:24</p><p>A couple of 'first time in glasses' sightings tonight, both very youthful, and both carrying on a family tradition, at the Christmas entertainment in a junior school where I'm a governor. On entering the packed hall, spotted a good looking kid, a bit too old for the school, in rather Harry Potter-ish glasses. After a moment ot two's thought, realized it was the headmaster's son whom I've never seen in specs before. His father is quite significantly myopic, and he seems to be following in father's footsteps. I did wonder if this could really be his first pair (but I've never noticed him squinting or anything). Minification definitely visible, and even a hint of power rings at some angles. He's a nice-looking kid with a clear complexion, dark hair and blue eyes and a ready smile - and, before anybody starts, all I do is look! (Incidentally on closer inspection the frames were not strictly round but flattened off a bit, and although the temples were black the fronts were white metal.) </p><p>Later in the evening when the older juniors came on, I was interested to notice the younger brother of a Pakistani kid who left last year and had got steadily more short-sighted as he progressed up the school; little brother was in black wire frames with  much lower minus lenses. Never mind: C'est le premier pas... </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2002, 02:19</p><p>More about the spexy postman. We coincided at my gate this morning and IT'S A DIFFERENT GUY! He had some queries about my mail including one item that was underpaid and after we'd sorted all that out I said something like "You must be missing your hair in this weather" and after a moment's bewilderment he realized what I was talking about and said "Oh no, that's Simon; he's delivering somewhere else and he still has his ponytail." Relieved about that, but there are a lot of similarities: both about six foot two, both with a heavy jaw line, both in their twenties, both with glasses. The present one (Martin) doesn't carry himself as well as Simon and is, I reckon, quite a bit more short sighted. Lenses around -4, maybe -5, in oblong white metal frames. Nice to know Simon hasn't lost his looks and his hair, even if he isn't on our street right now. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;13 Dec 2002, 07:57</p><p>Right. As I've said before it's the exception that proves the rule - and in my experience exceptions are rare. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;13 Dec 2002, 06:08</p><p>Jules. An exception to the rule? There is a teenage pakistani boy who lives in my area with plus myodiscs/lenticulars. </p><p> </p><p>I knew he had strong lenses but it was only when I saw him the other day that I saw that he was now in myosiscs.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;13 Dec 2002, 02:00</p><p>I don't need to tell anyone here how much interest a pair of specs can add to a good-looking guy. Last night I was walking down the high street and passed a tall young Pakistani who was waiting to cross the road - off-white anorak and baseball cap. But I wouldn't have given him a second look if he hadn't been wearing gold frames with black temples and a respectable minus prescription (Think I'll add another item to 'Jules's rules': all spexy Pakis are myopes.) </p><p>Later on, shopping in ASDA I passed a young couple - several times, but not so often as to make it obvious I was observing them or rather him: not very tall, with fairish hair and beard. Small oval specs - gold frames which I hardly noticed: the powerful minus lenses with plano front surfaces which reflected the light from time to time were so striking. A couple of times as we passed we exchanged glances and grins; he had nice straight white teeth. I wonder if he always wears glasses (I hope so!) or if he was just having a rest from contacts...if he'd been in contacts I'd have missed the week's star sighting. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Dec 2002, 09:03</p><p>The spexy postman I've mentioned several times in the course of this year is on duty round here again - but he's had his hair cut short and is much less sexy ::((  It was, if you remember, in a ponytail half way down his back, and made him distinctly noticeable. Now, specs or no specs, he looks very ordinary, even in figure and posture - and the last time I mentioned him i was deciding those were the main attraction. Pointed him out this morning to a neighbour who had also noticed him and he agreed with me. Tempted to call him over and say, "My friend and I think you should put your hair back on." Resisted the temptation. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2002, 23:13</p><p>A pleasant hour or more in my local this evening. For one thing it was the Saturday when there's no karaoke; for another it was the Saturday when a local rugby club comes in, so there were a lot of guys about, a few of them wearing glasses. My favourite of the crowd is a youngish-looking pale guy with short dark hair and rimless glasses with oblong minus lenses. Besides him there's an older guy, quite weatherbeaten, with minus lenses again in round wire frames. Short black hair, lenses quite a long way from his eyes. I was also interested when standing at the bar to notice that the guy next to me had a red mark on the side of his nose that looked like the effect of a pair of specs. He was tall with a fresh complexion and dark hair parted in the middle - nice - but at one point he turned to speak to somebody else and there was no corresponding mark on the other side of his nose. So perhaps that was just wishful thinking on my part. There was another guy, older and less athletic-looking, with plus bifocals in a small white wire frame. </p><p>I had two pints and then got up to go, but I got caught in conversation - with the rimless guy and an older man (we've seen each other in there often enough and know each other by sight). We talked a bit about rugby - the spexy guy was on about how much friendlier players are with their opponents after the match than soccer players and fans; he said he'd played since he was a kid and he's a couple of weeks from his fortieth birthday; this surprised me, he wears well, but he said his wife (who was there too) sees that he's well fed &amp;c.; By this time I needed to unload some of my beer, and I thought, I WILL ask him. So I said to him, "Tell me something. Those glasses you're wearing are really smart; but you can't wear them to play rugby. Can you see without them?' "Contact lenses," was the reply. Apparently he is quite content to wear glasses (and they are real beauties) but can tolerate soft contacts for the length of a match. I got quite a little lecture on the various sort of lenses that are available; I told him about a friend (whom I've written about on EyeScene before now) who couldn't see well with glasses and couldn't wear contacts for long and has now had - excuse my language - LASIK. That idea didn't appeal to him at all, for all sorts of sensible reasons. I'm glad about that; he looks really good in specs; the temples are quite fancy and I suspect his lenses might be around -3. But then again I might be exaggerating. Nice though. Nice, nice, nice! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2002, 22:51</p><p>Yet another London trip - the last for this year I hope. In the morning there was more to see on the station platform than on the train: a big crowd of student-looking people of both sexes. A few striking spexy guys among them, mostly with oval or oblong wire frames. I particularly noticed one with dark hair and strongish minus lenses in black oblongs, another fairly similar with weaker lenses, and - the pièce de resistance - a tall boy with short red hair newly cut, gold oval frames, and plus lenses strong enough to magnify his tawny eyes. He was really lovely. As the whole crowd surged on to the train, I spotted another, with longish fair hair and black frames. Nothing of particular interest on the London train, except that some of that group passed back and forward on the way to the buffet. </p><p>On the Northern Line (tube) a guy got on at Camden Town: jacket and tie, scarf. Black hair that would have been considered long in my young days. Oval black wire, heavier than some, with a modest minus Rx. The 'young fogey' image was enhanced by the copy of AN Wilson's 'The Victorians' which he was carrying. He fiddled for a while with his mobile phone (they don't work underground but perhaps he was playing a game) and then read his book. </p><p>Before starting for home I had an omelette and a couple of pints in the Head of Steam, a very nice pub just outside Euston station. Quite a few spexy guys in there, some worth a second look - nicest of all was a slim guy in a red polo shirt, sitting at the bar chating to a girl. Black oval frames (wire again), black hair and a slightly fluffy black beard. </p><p>On the concourse at Euston, waiting for the train to be announced, my attention was caught first by a short slim Asian guy who was pushing his glasses against his eyes to read the departure board. Once he'd seen what he wanted, he took them off and put them in his pocket...low minus lenses in a black trapezoidal wire frame, looked new; nice. One or two other Asians, a bit more myopic; a couple of Hasidic Jews, myopes of course, in rather uninspiring plastic frames; and a white guy with amazingly spiky hair and oval rimless specs - minus again. </p><p>The train home has just stopped at MIlton Keynes and the guy who was facing me has got off. He was fortyish, I guess, not specially attractive; short fair hair and brown plastic frames, modern in style, with a very marked cut-in and power rings visible from some angles. I estimate -5; not bifocal or progressive. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2002, 13:58</p><p>To start by cheating with a non-sighting, I was driving up the street this morning when, on a turn-off to the left, I saw a tall well-shaped guy with fair hair unloading something from a LandRover. I thought to myself, if he'd been wearing glasses I'd have made a detour to get a better look, even though it would have meant going all the way round the block. But he wasn't ::( </p><p>Yesterday, on the other hand, quite close to home, just round the corner in fact, I saw a guy I'd never seen before ambling down the street with an air of "almost home' A new resident? I thought - and I'm pretty sure he is, 'cause in the driving mirror I saw him going into one of the houses in the row. He was fairly tall, with a good head of dark curly hair and a fresh complexion. His specs were black wire oblongs with power rings...I'll hope to see more of him. </p><p>Tonight, the Boy Scouts' district carol concert; quite a few nice boys and young men with specs, mostly wire ovals of one kind or another. I noticed one kid of about 12 I'd call very short-sighted for his age (-5? -6?) and an older youth with short, well-cut fair hair and strong plus lenses in gold ovals. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2002, 21:07</p><p>Julian, Think what a time you could have on Metro North or the Long Island Railroad! On the other hand, riding the subway between Tribeca, Greenwich Village, and Chelsea might just the way to skip the boring commuters and really see some boys with glasses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2002, 01:56</p><p>That would be really funny, Christy - if you found yourself in my jottings, I mean. I'm fairly nondescript - but if you see a guy in glasses it might be me...especially if he's a bit overweight, older than he looks, and eyeing up every spexy guy in sight. I travel on the Manchester line by the way, with very rare exceptions. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2002, 14:07</p><p>Julian - one of these days I'm bound to be on the same London train as you. I've been on it four times in the past four weeks! Will I recognise you? Or will I find myself being described in a future installment of Julian's Jottings?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2002, 17:48</p><p>Another train to London... </p><p>As I took my seat I noticed the guy in the seat behind me (and had the occasional appraising glance en route): fairly smart casual in a striped T-shirt in two tones of grey; unshaven; short black hair; oblong black wire frames with a not-to-be-sneezed-at minus prescription - not a high myope, you understand, but power rings clearly in evidence. </p><p>A few seats away in the opposite direction, a big untidy youth with the beginnings of a beard and a shock of unkempt dark curls. Big oval specs with quite a heavy clear plastic front and metal temples. They look as if they're meant to make a statement - but have got it wrong! Plus lenses, strong enough to cause a slightly 'bug-eyed' effect. I wait with interest to see whether he keeps them on when we get to London or goes out into the world bareyed...my guess is that he ought to be a full-time wearer. [Later: he is, or at any rate he was still wearing them when he got off at Euston.] </p><p>Acros the gangway a middle-aged guy studying some papers through low minus lenses in round gold frames - his distance specs are on the shelf in front of him - gold again, oval, and obviously stronger. In front of him (got on at Milton Keynes) a youth with close-cropped hair and low minus lenses in black wire frames. A long the carriage a good-looking coloured guy using a laptop and wearing 'rounded-off-oblong' black wire frames, plus lenses not so strong. [He too was still wearing them when he got off the train; and I could see they were stronger than than they'd seemed, with a substantial cylinder component.] </p><p>Not much more that trip; only, on the Norther Line back to Euston, a tall youth with acne and oblong black metal frames with heavy metal temples; low minus Rx, specs a bit out of shape. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2002, 01:03</p><p>A 200 pound fixed penalty is about to be introduced, even when using a hands free kit.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;28 Nov 2002, 00:11</p><p>Julian, Is talking on a cellphone while driving an offence in the UK? It certainly is here in the State of New York. </p><p> </p><p>Haven't heard of anyone doing time at Sing-Sing for it yet, though. </p><p> </p><p>On another topic, do you suppose only myopes migrate? To put it nother way, does one have to be a minus lens wearer to change countries successfully?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2002, 08:25</p><p>More glimpses (did I just wake up or something)... </p><p>Before lunch today as I walked up the street, my Pakistani next-door neighbour was parking his car and getting out of it. He's a young guy with staright floppy hair that would have been considered long in 1960. I think he wears contacts some of the time but today he was in round gold wire frames that showed his fairly strong lenses to advantage - minus, need I say (all spexy Pakis are myopes, and it's the very rare exception that proves the rule.) Forty minutes later as I came out again he was driving up the street, talking on his mobile phone - that will soon mean an instant fine of 200 ukp. </p><p>Also today, a glimpse of a neighbour on the other side whom I haven't seen for a while: white man, not too exciting except in summer when he wears shorts - but dark wire frames, oval, with really strong plus lenses - just for a change. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2002, 01:35</p><p>Thanks, Charles; here's another one. </p><p>No more than a glimpse, this. As I was driving down the high street this morning, spotted a tall teenage lad on the pavement. Lovely head of blonde hair, cut short but not too short to show how curly it was. He was standing looking at something in his hand through preppy round wire specs, eyepieces covered in black, gold temples. I took my eyes off the road for far longer than I should have done, but he didn't look up and let me see his lenses. Funny how a glimpse can make a much impression as a guy you watch for a couple of hours on a train... </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Charles</b>&nbsp;26 Nov 2002, 16:58</p><p>I love to hear about your glimpses</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2002, 22:43</p><p>Dear Julian, </p><p> </p><p>Far more sightings, as you already know, and more opportunity to observe closely, exist on public transportation.  </p><p> </p><p>I am still sorting through in my head the sightings from a weekend in the southwestern part of America. Everone there goes around in cars, although I have had no fewer than six flight segments in which interesting wearers might have been available. Nobody stands out right now which must mean it was a very dull trip indeed. </p><p> </p><p>As always, we thank you for all of your train and pub sightings.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;25 Nov 2002, 03:43</p><p>Not a lot, actually, not to write home about. One thing that interested me though: last week I had to dash to London for a meeting and back as soon as it was over. One each of the trains there was a young guy sitting near me (a different guy on each train, you understand) using reading glasses. On the train to London it was a white guy in a dark business suit, black hair cut short. Black plastic frames, pretty much like the old NHS type (my first pair were like that but mottled brown) but they looked really good on him. Lenses plus, of course, but not all that strong. I forget if he was reading or using a laptop, but they came off when he stopped. Then on the train home later in the day it was an Asian with a shock of curly back hair (so maybe not pure-blooded Asian). His frames were also black plastic, but wider in shape, not oblong but more almond-shaped (?). I was too far away to get any idea of the Rx, but he took his specs off when he got up to go to the loo or the buffet, and put them back on when he sat down and started reading again. </p><p>On reflection, I might have done the same myself at their age (as a low hyperope with astigmatism) but I'd have been just as likely to keep them on when I moved around the train. </p><p>Funny how many of my sightings are on trains &amp;c.; Maybe it's just an environment where it's easy to relax and observe. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2002, 17:15</p><p>Anything to report julian?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2002, 06:33</p><p>A few decent sightings afer another long interval. Sunday night, got into conversation with a nice young man who was with friends of mine. Tall with reddish-fair hair cut short, prominent (but rather rounded) cheekbones, high colour, and blushed very easily - at one point I said, "Why have you gone that colour?" and he said, "Because I do." Now, I wouldn't be mentioning him here if he hadn't worn glasses, would I? Oval gold frames, -4 at least. He talked quietly but freely about being gay, in a way that suggested he expected me to know exactly what he was talking about...and, you understand, I reckon to be more discreet in real life than I am in this forum! </p><p>Monday-Tuesday, a business trip to London and then Bristol. I started badly by missing the London train by a hairsbreadth and having an hour's wait for the next one. Went to the refreshment room for a large coffee and was consoled by finding my favourite attendant on duty - I've mentioned him a couple of times before: lean, wide mouth, low minus lenses in (this time) round gold wire frames, high joint, longish dark hair poking out of a green baseball cap (uniform, along with a green fleece). He was very chatty too, and helpful when I managed to spill my coffee. </p><p>While I sat drinking my coffee I enjoyed the sight of a tall youth studying the monitor that tells you what trains ought to be coming through strong plus lenses in a black wire frame, and another with a goatee beard and low to medium minus lenses in round black wire frames. </p><p>(Later on Monday) I'm now on the London to Bristol train, after a l-o-n-n-g-g-g wait at Paddington station, where all the trains were delayed, and I had to wait till after seven before I could use a cheap ticket. Diagonally opposite me is a young guy with short mid-brown hair working (or playing, maybe?) on his laptop. He has minus lenses (cut-in but no power rings from where I'm sitting) in frames like the ones school kids wore fifty years ago - apart from a subtle bit of decoration on the nose piece...he got off at Reading, revealing, across the carriage, a thin-faced youth with a shock of fair curls and gold frames with thin but strong minus lenses. </p><p>(Tuesday) a rather fraught journey back from Bristol. Next to me for part of the way a nice boy with fair hair and low minus lenses in oblong black wire frames. After Birmingham an Asian guy in oval semi-rimless specs, bronze wire, with minus lenses. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Nov 2002, 10:16</p><p>Rather concerned about the prevalence of emmetropia among the teenagers of this town. This afternoon I ws driving along a road just as the schools were coming out. Saw three lads approaching and thought, that one's wearing glasses. At closer range, he wasn't. 50 yards behind them, a taller, older youth on his own. Ah, I thought, this one really is. Guess what: he wasn't either. Is this wishful thnking on my part, or an effect of eye sockets in shadow, or what? </p><p>'Fraid that's a non-jotting about non-sightings. Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2002, 06:29</p><p>Oh, honestly! On her nose, small octagonal wire frames, mottled when you see them close up (not the most vecoming she's ever had). On the rest of her a gorgeous red dress and stole. She was bareheaded. Given away by a daughter; grandchildren were bridesmaids (white dresses with sashes matching the bride's dress) and pageboy (tiny morning suit)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Frank</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2002, 19:11</p><p>Julian, that was a lovely wedding - and so delicately described. Can you tell us what the bride wore, on her nose of course. Thanks a bunch </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 Oct 2002, 17:39</p><p>Good grief, four weeks since I posted anything! If I'd been posting every day these last three weeks there would be reams of jottings: I was away for a couple of weeks with my eyes open and my glasses clean; home for a few frantic days; then in London for four days. There were so many sexy spexy guys I could have written about - but not always the time to write it all down. A few highlights, then... </p><p>...At a wedding. Couldn't actually say I've never seen so many plus specs; but there wasn't a minus Rx in sight. The bride and the groom were past the first flush of youth, had both been married before, and both wore plus, the groom with quite a strong Rx. The best man was, I think, the groom's son: looked like a younger version of him and had a MUCH higher plus Rx (internal reflections visible as he moved his head) with brown wire frames not so very unlike my own. The usher looked like another son: no glasses; great big light blue eyes. I suspected contacts. Several spexy guys among the guests, one quite attractive with black wire frames and again a plus Rx. That was all the observation I managed that day... </p><p>...At a big gathering in London. Lots of people, some I knew, a lot I didn't. Met two brothers I used to see quite a lot of 30 years ago or more. Both have to be in their 50s, as I remember being at the younger brother's 21st. He didn't wear glasses then (as far as I knew) but is now wearing semi-rimless with a not-to-be-sneezed-at minus prescription (-2? -3?). I didn't immediately recognize him; he has filled out (hark who's talking!) and lost most of his hair. His elder brother, on the other hand, was instantly recognizable. He has kept a much more youthful figure, and plenty of hair (white now, and cut short). He always wore fairly strong minus glasses, and still does - round gold. Nice to see them after all these years anyway... </p><p>...At dinner another evening in a biggish group. Nice young man with short dark curly hair and great big brown eyes. He took his glasses off and put them on the table during the mea but wore them the rest of the time: white metal ovals with a low Rx - I thought it was plus but it may have had more cylinder than anything; I'm not sure... </p><p>...In a country pub which I visited several times. Distinctly cuddly landlord: longish dark hair, brown eyes, short beard. Biggish round gold frames, -3 at a guess, ready smile and straight white teeth. Married, but well worth looking at... </p><p>...In another country pub where I had lunch one day. Landlord had a beard and strongish plus Rx, semi-rimless; but there was a young lad appeared once or twice from the kitchen: tall, very thin, grey polo shirt advertising some college, short straight black hair, dark wire ovals, strong enough minus for him to keep them on... </p><p>...on various tube and bus journeys round London. One good-looking youth in oblong white wire semi-rimless specs sat down next to me and then moved acros the carriage to where there was more room. At first sight I thought his lenses were minus; when he moved away they looked plus. Eventually as he moved his head it was obvious there was a lot of cylinder there... </p><p>...Another day a great tall guy, six foot four maybe; big hands, big feet, long arms and legs, clear tanned complexion; observing his face I wondered if he was over-producing growth hormone. Anyway his eyeballs had obviously lengthened with his height, judging by the strong minus lenses in his dark wire frames. Lots of power rings, cut-in, minification... </p><p>...one evening, at Embankment tube station, noticed a slim fair lad of about 18 or 19 who hadn't shaved for a few days; might have hurt when he did as he had a bit of acne. He was *really* short sighted; squared-off oval frames, plano fronted lenses. The train when it came was pretty full, we boarded the same carriage and stood till Oxford Circus where quite aa few people got off. We took facing seats, got off at the same station, caught the same bus, got off at the same stop. I was getting ever so slightly embarrassed, but he eventually took the turn-off before mine... </p><p>...another evening, at the same bus stop, a tall guy with short curly black hair, as the bus approached pulled out a pair of specs and put them on (to checck the destination maybe) but then kept them on. Plastic frames, dark above, clear below (the sort of thing I was wearing around 1960) but modern in shape. Minus lenses but not all that strong... </p><p>...then there was the morning I went for a haircut in a small barber's shop in London (not too central). When I went in the chatty young barber was cutting a guy with olive skin and black hair, and there was a middle-aged Jewish man waiting. The barber finished with the first customer, and the Jewish guy sat in the chair and took off his glasses and his skullcap. As the first customer left I realized that he'd put on dark wire specs with a definite minus prescription. Another barber arrived, a much older and less talkative guy, and started work on me. I was having a shampoo as well as a cut, and the old man was a slower worker, and by the time he was ready to cut my hair another customer had arrived, a tall slim Indian aged about 25, with a short beard and glasses. When he was in the chair next to mine, bareyed of course, I could see a face that was both handsome and pleasant. When his hair was done he (of course) got up and put his glasses on - and at that precise moment the barber's arm was in front of my eyes and I couldn't get a proper look! I think they were plastic semi-rimless; they were quite new-looking. I think they were minus. Bu I can't be sure. The next customer in the other chair didn't wear glasses - the first customer I'd seen who didn't... </p><p>...finally, at Newport Pagnell service station on the way home, an Asian family, parents and two sons. The men all wore glasses, and the two boy looked great in them (dark wire frames with their black hair and dark complexion). From a couple of tables away only Dad's were obviously strong (minus), but careful observation showed that one boy's were fairly strong as well. The other I couldn't be too sure about, but the genes are onviously there... </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Henry</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2002, 16:56</p><p>Nice sighting yesterday at a local city. A saw a guy early twenties going in to a town centre store. he had frameless specs in gold( quite a high brownish tint) with a high minus script but with a kind of fake jewell in the arms of the specs. he bought a copy of the independant. Medium height guy slimish build in denims. Cool or what?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2002, 08:18</p><p>My car broke down on the M1 this morning (promises to be expensive) fortunately as I was driving into a service area where I had a longish wait and spent some of the time getting a bite to eat. Multitudes of spexy guys of course, some of them worth a second and a third look... </p><p>1. At a table near mine two men who might have been father and son. The younger one was quite significantly short-sighted - white metal semi-rimless with marked minification and from some angles power rings. they got up and left just after I arrived, and then... </p><p>2. A (presumably) married couple with a baby arrived at a table by the window. Dad had short hair, clear complexion and dark wire semi-rimless. Not as strong as the previous one but visibly minus. </p><p>3. As I was about to leave I spotted another tall guy in glasses passing the window. he didn't come into the cafeteria but was in the shop a few minutes later. Minus again, roundish gold. </p><p>4. The recovery driver who brought me and my car home was no great beauty - sallow complexion, not a bad figure. Modestly minus prescription shades - white wire aviators. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2002, 23:26</p><p>Called at a stationery supermarket for rolls for the fax machine. The staff uniform there is black pants (or skirt) and red polo shirt, which can be very smart. Spotted a guy whose name tag said he was 'Head cashier': short fair curly hair, fair clear complexion. Black oblong frames, not heavy, with really strong plus lenses. While I was browsing over some pens and trying to get a good look he asked if he could help me ::) - I try to do my spotting unobserved. </p><p>A few minutes later, when I was in the car, there was a very tall slim guy with a blonde girl. His hair was fair too, and he was wearing round black-covered wire glasses. Plus again, but nothing like as strong as the other guy. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2002, 02:55</p><p>A nice sighting yesterday: a slim guy in his twenties (I guess), dark curly hair cut short, fresh complexion and a tan, blue checked shirt. Wire framed glasses with black temples, Rx didn't look much from a distance, but on closer inspection it turned out the frames were round, and the lenses quite strong plus, strong eneough to give a total inversion of the distant view. </p><p>Then this morning. I was checking EyeScene at seven o'clock when the morning's post arrived. This was two hours earlier than usual, and suggested my favourite postman (whom I've jotted about here before) - pony tail half way down his back, designer stubble, minus specs. A dash to the window confirmed that I was right; I had a rear view as he went to the next house, and I found myself wondering what it is about him that attracts me (and I'm not alone in liking him). Glasses of course: the hair is interesting, face nothing special, figure OK. I think his whole carriage and posture does the trick. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2002, 15:23</p><p>London again - the last trip for a while, and an overnight stay this time. I got to the station particularly early for a train that was due at 17.12 (and was on time). Just before five o'clock I saw a slim youth in glasses heading for the refreshment room at speed. I left it a few minutes, and then went in for an espresso. Sure enough, it was the same counter assistant I admired the other week - hair not as tidy, pants crumpled, different specs: round wire frames again, but brown and low joint; the others were gold and high joint, and suited him better...I've a notion they were stronger too; these were really weak. </p><p>On the train to London (where I'm writing at the moment) there's a slim tanned guy a couple of seats away working on a Dell laptop and frowning at it a lot of the time. Hazel to brown eyes, black hair with a slight wave, ovalish black wire frames that slide down his nose a bit, minus lenses. At first I thought they were weakish, but as he moves his head I can see a hefty cut-in. From time to time he says something to the people sitting around him, and breaks into a cheeky grin that reveals uneven white teeth.  </p><p>(A bit later) He got off at Milton Keynes, and then I caught sight of the guy in the seat facing his, (back to me, almost invisible): mauve shirt, semi-rimless glasses, plus with plenty of cylinder. A few men got on at Milton Keynes, speaking a Scandinavian language. One of them was tall with blond hair, dark jaket and slacks, black T-shirt (or something similar) and black oval-ish frames, low minus. </p><p>Most interesting thing on the train though, the guy sitting next to me (olive skin and wiry back hair greying slightly at the temples); as we approached London the daylight began to fade, and he took off his wraparound shades, which I hadn't taken any notice of, and put on a pair of specs with substantial black plastic frames, roughly hexagonal, and tinted minus lenses, to read his Guardian (newspaper). Not my kind of thing, but they looked quite good on him. The shades must have been prescription, but well-concealed. </p><p>Last significant sighting of the evening: on Euston tube station I saw a slim youth in glasses board the train and managed to find a seat within sight of him. His hair was short and fair; he had headphones on. When he got off at Tottenham Court Road I noticed he was wearing more layers of clothing than I'd have wanted in this weather: T-shirt, shirt and donkey jacket all show over his jeans. His face would have been beautiful without optical accessories (lean, chiselled cheekbones, fair complexion) but his black wire frames and minus lenses (not high minus, but a hint of edge thickness from a side view) - oh, my children, they improved on perfection! </p><p>And that's just Wednesday evening! </p><p>Thursday turned out to be less interesting. Walking, tubing and bussing round London, and attending a meeting in the middle of the day, didn't reveal many BwGs to jot about (LOTS of glimpses, but not much I could study). The meeting was of a small group of people I know fairly well: the youngest guy there wears msart oblong black frames with a decent plus prescription...in the queue and on the bus back to Euston, a guy with short fair hair, a deent figure and gold frames with plus lenses. </p><p>Last thing of any interest: I was sitting by the window of the pub on the forecourt outside Eston station, watching the world go by, when I noticed a young guy with a neat figure walking across the bus lanes talking on his mobile phone. I was enjoying the sight when I got an impression he might be wearing glasses - and as he came closer he clearly was! Fine gold ovals, no idea of the Rx, he was too far away. But how nice that he turned out to be spexy as well as sexy! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 Sep 2002, 01:36</p><p>Hi Clare. No, I have *always* noticed low minus (and low plus) wearers. Writing them all down would be a full time job, and this thread only gets the highlights: perhaps specially interesting specs, or possibly a specially interesting guy. There was one of each in that last post! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2002, 23:13</p><p>Julian, love your sightings, keep 'em coming. With your excellent spec-spotting powers, would you say you're noticing more low minus wearers than before?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2002, 17:32</p><p>This week's London trip had a lot less to jot about that last week's; the nice young man I saw last week wasn't on duty at the station buffet; the guy opposite me on the train might have been wearing contacts but I was less certain than last week (crisp ginger hair, hint of a goatee beard, navy blue guernsey and a red anorak). The star spotting of the day was on Oxford Street: a solidly built guy in jeans, trainers and a blue shirt overtook me and I managed to keep behind him for a while and observe his lenses (which were in black wire frames). He very definitely had more cylinder than sphere in front of each eye; very curiously distorted images. </p><p>Another nice sight was at (I think) Oxford Circus tube station: very tall slim guy with minus lenses, not very strong, in wire frames. </p><p>On the train home a short black guy, not bad looking, with minus lesnes in oblong wire frames. He took them off for a while but later they were back on. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Sep 2002, 17:23</p><p>Yes, Clare. The other night a young teacher I know came into the pub with his wife and year-old son, and the kid's habit of grabbing at dad's specs started a discussion about glasses. Ed had gone for a really cool rimless, hingeless, unbreakable pair in the expectation of that kind of trouble, and I got a chance to examine them (he's pretty myopic BTW) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;30 Aug 2002, 17:38</p><p>Went to give a pint of blood thus afternoon (in the local Methodist church hall). There was a youth hanging around when I first arrived; I'd have thought he was a bit young to be a donor but I could be wrong. Grey sweatshirt, black curly hair, dark skin, though whether it was racial colouring or just a sallow complexion I couldn't be sure. Black wire frames with ferociouly, savagely strong minus lenses; power rings very obvious. I think they were thicker at the sides than top and bottom - but it isn't too easy to observe while lying on a couch wearing progressives. And when I went for my cup of tea he'd gone ::( </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;30 Aug 2002, 17:01</p><p>Julian - in case you're still interested in the hingeless question, yes you can fold them.  I have some very stylish Lindberg frames which are hingeless and they're gorgeous. In fact I can't imagine the thought of something with hinges and screws.  And as to folding them, no problem - after all they're just stylised titanium, they fold on themselves.  Amazing stuff.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;30 Aug 2002, 05:06</p><p>First of a string of London trips yesterday; it started well and carried on much the same way. At the station (I'd rushed out of the house too late to make coffee) I was thinking of getting a coffee and the sight of the young man on the buffet counter decided me in favour: slim, sallow complexion, chiselled cheekbones, a good head of dark brown hair parted in the middle. Biggish round gold specs with minus lenses, no more than -2 I guess, finished off the picture. He was pleasant and fairly chatty too. </p><p>On the train the young guy opposite me was as obvious a contact wearer as I've seen in a month of Sundays: eyes very slightly bloodshot, blinking a bit, and from time to time closing his eyes and massaging his eyelids. Plus that glint. His eyes were light blue-grey. Short black hair, mauve shirt. At Watford Junction he got a matching tie out of his bag and put it on and started to read a magazine about PR. Meanwhile, next to me, an older guy with a beard, black wire frames and minus lenses who was studying some papers - and at one point took off his specs to look closely at a particular item. As we approached London he changed into mottled brown plastic frames with edge thickness visible. I thought perhaps he was changing out of readers, but he continued to read. (But of course he may have been changing over from readers to progressives - that just occurred to me). </p><p>At Euston tube station, and for the first part of my journey to Victoria, I was keeping an eye on a young man in a business suit with very smart oblong black and silver frames, pretty new I guess, and thin but strong minus lenses. </p><p>Later on, after my meeting which was in Westminster, passed by Westminster School as on so many previous occasions. The boys have obviously started back earlier than some, and there was perhaps a better-than-usual quota of smart-looking specs with minus lenses. As I left Dean's Yard, however, there was a boy wandering along using a mobile phone. He wore gold frames and, the first I've ever spotted there, PLUS lenses. Couldn't get a really good look but suspected cylinder as well as sphere. </p><p>On the train home the guy next to me wore white metal frames with a minus Rx to read a printout or photocopy which looked medical. After going right through it and marking various passages he started up his laptop and when I got off the train was still editing a document on that - the same one? I don't know. </p><p>Last of all, I got off the train behind a pretty youth with blonde hair, fresh complexion and oval rimless specs that looked ot be the hingeless type. Can you use their flexibility to fold them up or are you stuck with them perpetually open? </p><p>As a postscript, I had a dental appointment this morning. As I drove away there was a sallow youth walking a dog: round black wire frames that suited him a treat; no idea of the Rx. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;22 Aug 2002, 01:10</p><p>Last night, in one of the best of the many excellent pubs in this area, a guy I've seen there before and, I'm pretty sure, jotted about here. About six feet and well-built; could easily be a rugby player. Right write in plaster and sling. Jeans, T-shirt, sandals (no socks) Curly black hair cut short; fresh complexion. Round white metal frames with dark-coloured temples, -2, maybe -3. A bit of cut-in and a little bit of edge thickness but power rings not in evidence. Lenses slightly tinted, possibly photochromic, which emphasized the shadows on his eyelids which made him particularly appealing. Drinking beer with his wife. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;21 Aug 2002, 06:55</p><p>On the way up the street this morning, engaged pleasantries with a guy who was getting into a lorry to drive off to work - and he started the conversation ::) He was fairly tall and slim, dressed in jeans and singlet; balding a bit but some reddish hair cut very short; showed uneven teeth when he smiled. Glasses? Rounded off oblongs, black covered, temples white metal. Minus lenses, not very strong but obviously he would need them to drive. </p><p>Oh yes, and there was yesterday too; at a motorway service station up north in Christy country, two young guys, both really thin, who looked as if they might be on holiday together. One, in jeans and T-shirt, wore oblong wire frames with a low minus Rx and took them off while he ate his all day breakfast. The other wore shorts and T-shirt; he was both less hungry and more myopic, and his frames were quite big gold circles, with a mottled brown front to them. Trainers, no socks, thin hairy legs. Oh well. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Henry</b>&nbsp;12 Aug 2002, 14:21</p><p>A nice sighting yesterday. A  man  about early forties on his own at an agricultural show. Slim,well dressed but casual. Delicate Arms with a "curled" effect. the front was frameless with a high tint. Quite a strong plus lens I think. i was just about to speak to him when he left!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Aug 2002, 08:12</p><p>Yet another glimpse from the car. A handsome young Pakistani on the pavement, walking the same way as I was going, carrying a few bags of shopping. Smart black wire frames, lenses PLUS with a lot of cylinder. As I've often remarked before the vast majority of spexy Pakis are myopes; in fact this is only the third young Asian guy I can remember who wore plus lenses. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 Aug 2002, 05:21</p><p>In ASDA this morning to pick up one or two items I forgot at Tesco on Saturday, I spotted a burly youth on one of the checkouts: ginger hair with spiky blonde highlights and ovalish gold frames, a bit small for his face in my opinion. He seemed to be dealing with a big order, so I went to the next checkout, where the customer before me had a small collection of goods. I noticed, however, that although the spexy guy was being very attentive and helpful to his customer, who was partially disabled, he had dealt with her pretty quickly. I also noticed that his lenses, which I had taken at first glance for low minus, were actually lowish plus with substantial cylinder - so I can just imagine his discomfort if he'd been operating his till bareyed! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2002, 10:20</p><p>An amazing series of glimpses from the car this afternoon. </p><p>First there was the car with two big black (or at any rate café-au-lait) guys in it, both with close cropped hair, both with dark wire frames. Couldn't get much impression of the lenses, but they weren't high plus or minus. </p><p>Then a guy driving out of a side street in a shirt and tie, Roundish wire frames, definitely plus lenses. </p><p>A passenger in a car that passes in front of me on a roundabout: black T-shirt, black ovals, minus. </p><p>A particularly appealing boy of about 18 sitting on the edge of the pavement: round white wire frames, plus I think but it was only a glimpse. </p><p>And finally a handsome Pakistani boy with oval frames in white wire and a fairly low minus prescription (I actually read somewhere on the net the other day that the Asian races are more subject to myopia than Westerners) </p><p>All this in the space of twenty to thirty minutes! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2002, 10:18</p><p>Last night in a village pub with some friends. Quite a lot of conversation with the landlord, who had plenty to say about all sorts of things. he was tall and tanned with short dark hair, pretty thin, a hint of a goatee beard, and semi-rimless glasses with strong plus lenses. Later he was going around bareyed. </p><p>As we left there was a big smart car stopped and the guy driving it not too sure where he was but trying to find the way to Manchester Airport. We managed to give him directions. He was either coloured or sallow in complexion. He had semi-rimless specs too; the lenses weren't strong but from where I was I couldn't be sure if they were plus or minus. Nice though. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Aug 2002, 05:26</p><p>A good-looking younger colleague (early 40s, just ripe for the onset of presbyopia) has recently given up the struggle and started wearing readers at work; I know he's had them for some time. He says he can't see across the room with them, and he leaves one pair at work and another at home. Yesterday when he was out I investigated his specs and was interested to discover that the left lens is quite a bit stronger (plus, of course) and the right has a bit of cylinder. Obviously, then, his distance Rx is not (as I thought) Plano/Plano, and there's the prospect of bifocals in due course. Another thought occurs to me: perhaps that *is* his distance Rx, and the only reason he can't see far with them on is that he's never worn them enough to get used to them. (Theodore please note!) I shall watch his future progress with considerable interest. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

If Singa or anyone else has more information on this fascinating youg man,I would appreciate receiving it. </p><p> </p><p>I have long been into sightings, but this is my first attempt at sharing in writing:  This morning around 7 a.m., as I was going into a deli for bagels, a beautiful young man passed me on the sidewalk.  He was thin,wearing not-quite-tight-enough jeans, but a fairly tight organge t-shirt from a local volunteer fire department.  He was smoking a cigarette.  He was wearing smallish, rectangular, black metal- framed glasses.  I'm not very good yet in guessing RX's but his lenses looked fairly thick (especially considering that they were rather smallish.)  I paused at the window of the deli, hoping that he would come in, so I could get a closer look.  But, alas, he walked right by on his way somewhere else. </p><p> </p><p>Toby</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Aug 2002, 06:59</p><p>Just to follow up on my last post - </p><p>brief conversation with a fairly new next-door neighbour about a car that was blocking both our entries. Bronzed with short dark hair; shorts which revealed a decent pair of legs. Dark wire ovals with spectacularly HIGH PLUS lenses. They aren't all low minus! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2002, 14:01</p><p>Yes, maybe. But (to repeat myself) as far as I'm concerned any guy in glasses is interesting until proved boring; low Rx as well as high, plus as well as minus. </p><p>By the way I found a gorgeous photo of Freddie Prinze jr, bareyed and squinting like mad. I've posted it in the 'Stars in specs' album in Dom's Yahoo group. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>...</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2002, 11:44</p><p>Lots of low minus sightings Julian, perhaps there's a trend developing ... ;)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Aug 2002, 09:40</p><p>Been offline for almost a week while I was on holiday in Scotland. (Some of you would call it vacation.) Of course I kept my eyes open and my glasses clean all week, but the most memorable part of the trip, as far as BwGs were concerned, was the journey home yesterday... </p><p>1. At a service area on the M74 (there was a piper at the door, a youth who played quite well but didn't wear glasses, and his kilt was quite ridiculously long, right over his knees ::( ) I noticed a family in a people carrier with bikes attached to the back. Dad was securing the bikes a bit better, and one young lad, around the age of puberty I'd guess, was exercising a dog in the car park: fair hair, fair clear complexion, wire frames and low minus lenses. Too young of course, but will break a few hearts before long. </p><p>2. At the best service place on the M6, the sight of the the counter assistant decided me that I did want an espresso: slim, medium height, yellow polo shirt, short black hair partly covered by a round black pillbox cap, and a heavy five o'clock shadow (well, he was entitled, it was almost that time) and PALE BLUE eyes that mostly looked over the top of flattened oval black wire frames with a low minus Rx. I seated myself where I could watch the counter; and by the time I left he had pushed his glasses up his nose and was looking through them. He gets the gold award (but only just); 24 hours on, the memory makes me come over all unnecessary. </p><p>3. A bit later, on the road, I overtook a dark blue car driven by a guy with crisp fairish hair, round wire glasses, and no shirt. I let him overtake me a few minutes later and then he sped out of sight - not a notion of his Rx. </p><p>4. Doing some shopping at Tesco before I came home, I noticed a new boy on the till: very tall and slim with really blonde hair and dark wire oval frames. I made sure I went to his checkout and discovered that his lenses were quite strong, maybe -4, maybe a bit less. I'll definitely watch out for him on future visits. </p><p>5. Between first spotting him and going to pay, I came across two lads, students maybe, shopping for six-packs. The taller one (six foot two or three) had a shock of fair hair, a creamy complexion, and a low minus prescription, possibly with a decent amount of cylinder, in white metal frames. He was a beauty anyway, but the specs both attracted my attention and put the finishing touch to him. Silver for him - and bronze for the boy on the checkout. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>henry</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2002, 16:55</p><p>a couple of sightings in my loal supermarket. First a skinny guy - about mid forties with the now very popular semi rimless glasses which clomprise of mainly semi rimless rectangular glasses with rounded off corners. not much of a looker but the fact was that the rimless part of the frame was at the top! </p><p> </p><p>The second sighting was at the same location. This guy was about mid thirties and had nice short dark hair. He was built like someone who could carry you out of a fire and semed a very polite sort of a person. However he would never has passed the physical! Left eye about -6 or more which looked a lot stronger because of low index lenses. Right eye, probably a plus lens but I would estimate only about +1 or 2 but a great deal of astigmatism. He had a turn in his eyes which could not be hidden</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;26 Jul 2002, 01:14</p><p>Here we are again! Quick trip to a cash-and-carry warehouse yesterday. I kept noticing a youth who was stacking shelves and moving stock around - slim, fair hair, creamy complexion, tiny tuft of beard, round gold frames with I think, plus lenses. Even better was another customer - and I ended up behind him in the queue for the checkout: cord jeans, polo shirt, trim figure and good posture, short fairish hair. Assertive black metal frames (too heavy to call them wire) with thick minus lenses, maybe -5 or -6. The guy at the checkout was also quite short-sighted, but nothing to write home about. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2002, 05:54</p><p>Henry, I think you must have jolted me back into 'spot it and jot it' mode! Two tantalizing glimpses from the car yesterday: </p><p>A van going the other way, driven by a guy with very fair hair cut short, fair skin and black wire frames - alas, I saw no more! </p><p>A young guy on the pavement: short light brown hair, T-shirt that matched his hair, oval gold specs with a modest minus Rx. </p><p>Oh yes, and one more from today, again from the car, but walking the opposite way when I was letting another car through; Asian, tall and plump, bit of a beard, oval frames (were they gold or were they black?) with obvious power rings. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2002, 22:59</p><p>Nice of you to ask, Henry! Not a lot to be honest, though there have been things I'd have jotted about if I hadn't been so busy (a series of young men in black wire glasses in the bookshop at New Street Station in Birmingham for instance). </p><p>Just one sighting yesterday, since you ask. Kids are not my scene at all, but from the car I spotted a very pretty little boy of 10 or 12, clear fair complexion, red hair, oblong gold frames. He will be well worth watching in a few years' time. </p><p>And another observation, in a *junior* school the other week: of the kids who wore glasses, the vast majority had plus lenses, and quite strong ones at that. This is contrary to previous observations of older kids; but these were maybe too young for mayopia to have set in in most cases. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>henry</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2002, 11:48</p><p>any good recent sightings Julian?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2002, 10:50</p><p>Well done Julian!  Now aren't you glad you asked??  When I was young my mother always told me that, once you'd done something that was difficult (as in a 'difficult' conversation) it was always easier the next time.  I never believed her, but you might disagree!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2002, 08:39</p><p>Clare, I asked him. I didn't think I'd get the chance as it was quite a busy session, and there were other people around, but the opportunity came right at the end. I said "Tell me something. Did you always wear glasses are is that something new?" </p><p>"Oh, they're new this year," he said. "The last time I saw you before this week was March" (checking his notebook) "and that was just before I got them. I guess it's something that comes to all of us." </p><p>"Oh well," I said, remembering what you told me, "they look good on you anyway." </p><p>They do too...and with that we went our separate ways. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2002, 13:13</p><p>Julian </p><p>I say ask that guy!  As someone whos recently met lots of people whod never seen me with glasses before I speak from experience.  I assure you its worse when someone you know has never seen you wear glasses doesnt mention them!  I usually get comments like you dont usually wear glasses do you? and I like your glasses   and Im much happier when people comment than when someone says nothing.  I know theyre thinking it but feel uncomfortable about saying anything!   </p><p> </p><p>You say hes got a low rx but I assume it looks as though he really needs them.  Suppose hes a new wearer, he might be a bit self-conscious so a compliment would be welcome.  It always makes me feel heaps better when someone pays me a compliment about my specs. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2002, 05:08</p><p>First sightings worth jotting about for some time... </p><p>A good-looking young guy I see from time to time on business turned up yesterday wearing glasses. He's around six feet, slim, with a high colour, black hair and a nice smile. He was wearing black wire ovals with a low minus Rx - very fetching. I nearly asked him if they were new, but chickened out. Oddly enough I shall be seeing him again in a couple of days, so I might screw up my courage and pretend I hadn't noticed them before. We'll see... </p><p>Then a glimpse from the car, a big fair youth, pale complexion, hair close-cropped. Bold black wire frames and plus lenses. </p><p>This morning a guy driving past in a van: untidy back hair, Mexican moustache, round black-covered wire frames with gold temples. Plus I think. </p><p>And finally, it's the sexy spexy young postman's week on this round. That's always cheering - and the post arrives around 07.00. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Jun 2002, 03:29</p><p>Another nice one. Last night, in a pub with a group of friends, we were being served by a small blonde barmaid, when a tall guy came though from the other bar: slim, pale complexion, close-cropped blackhair, goatee beard almost as short; black pant, blue shirt. Black oval frames, not-to-be-sneezed-at minus lenses. I said to one of the party who knows how many beans make five, "Gosh, I wish he was serving in here." We agreed we wouldn't kick him out of bed on a wet Tuesday afternoon...later, when things got busy in our bar, he did serve for a bit. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2002, 10:18</p><p>This one's hot from the street! About twenty minutes ago I was driving down a side street I actually needed to drive up. I saw a young man in a business suit walking up on the other side, looking quite hot. When I came closer to him I looked again to discover for the first time that he was wearing glasses - semi-rimless, dark wire. I took the option turning left and left again, then right in the hope of getting a a second look - but he'd disappeared. It is a welcome bonus when a good-looking guy turns out on closer inspection to be spexy as well as sexy. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fathom</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2002, 02:41</p><p>Julian, your explanation helps a lot.  I understand much better now, thanks!  Maybe I should start out by observing the lenses of those whose cylinder power  </p><p>I actually know the strength of (I'm not really shy about asking friends, colleagues, etc. their prescription - but this is assuming they even know their cylinder Rx) and apply what you've written.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2002, 18:40</p><p>Just to keep the pot boiling: I filled up at Sainsbury's filling station earlier on, and when I came out after paying there were two good-looking guys filling their cars up: right in front of my car a tall fair guy with red-gold hair and strong plus lenses in round to oval gold frames; over on my left a slim or even lean guy with dark hair and dark oval wire frames, minus lenses, couldn't really tell how strong - or whether they were actually semi-rimless.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2002, 18:32</p><p>Fathom: Sorry, I saw your post, meant to come back and answer it, and forgot. What I mean by power *arcs* is the effect you get with a highish minus cylinder where a lens is quite strong minus in one axis only: in two places opposite each other you have arcs of the power rings you'd have if the lens had that strength all the way round. And yes, you will get minification along that axis too, but it shows as a marked distortion of the image you see through the lens. Where a lens is plus on one axis and minus at right angles to it it can look like, let me see, a plus lens when you're close to it and a minus one when the wearer moves away. </p><p>Hope I'm not confusing you more than ever ::) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hearty</b>&nbsp;05 Jun 2002, 17:24</p><p>Fathom, I hope someone can help you with that one, I never could quite grasp the whole concept....there were some great explainations in the old forum, but uhh....I fergot how it goes! </p><p>I had a great sighting, but not sure where to put it...it's not glasses but well, while getting into my car at the supermarket today, I noticed this real HUNK of a carriage collector...he didn't look like the usual, he was very handsome, strong, somewhat raw-boned, with closely cropped dark hair....lovely jawline, anyway I noticed that he had one blind eye...it was closed into a slit, and you could tell he used the other eye to see with, though that one was slighly slitty (?) too. That look just soooo went with all the rest of him, yet he didn't look mean or harsh...in fact, my jaw dropped when I saw him go over to a young couple and help load their bags into the trunk! That NEVER happens in good ole New England! I was just so transfixed, wishing he were older and had a better job....I mean that eye looked so totally dead, he was really compelling....hey, maybe I'll happen to drop one of my grocery bags tomorrow!? </p><p>Hearty~</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fathom</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2002, 00:15</p><p>I'm still learning how to judge other people's Rx more accurately, but I always come up short when it comes to astigmatism.  Julian, I read your posting of 29 Dec 2001 to Pip about how to judge whether there's cylinder in a lens.  The info has been very helpful, but I still have a few questions that maybe you (or anyone else) could help me out with. </p><p> </p><p>What exactly did you mean by "power arcs" instead of power rings in glasses with higher astigmatic powers?  I got a bit confused by this. </p><p> </p><p>Does a minus cylinder minify the wearer's eyes at all, and does a plus cylinder do the opposite?  Would the axis have any effect on this at all? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;02 Jun 2002, 07:31</p><p>Went to the theatre the other night in a party to see 'Macbeth' peformed in the round with minimal scenery, and apparently no makeup - at the end the players were in the bar almost as soon as the audience with no signs of greasepaint having been cleaned off. They were out of costume - and Banquo, a tall guy with untidy short fair hair and a hint of a beard, had put on his glasses: semirimless with heavyish 'frames' in brown mottled plastic, rather retro. Lenses were minus, not high but not negligible, maybe around -3. In any case it's fairly obvious he put them on as soon as the play was over and was comfortable that way, though he didn't seem to have problems onstage. He's wearing them in the photo in the programme for example. </p><p>Another nice sighting was in the front row of the audience, and mingling with the players afterwards: slim with short dark hair and oblong dark wire frames with low minus lenses and a fair bit of cylinder.</p><p></p><hr>

She is a moderate myope, with significant cut-in, and her frames are black plastics in an oblong artsy shape...the outline dents in slightly on the top outer corners, and they have a narrow strip of ivory along the edges (they look black unless she turns or puts her head down, then the ivory line is visible) </p><p>Too bad it is all lost on my daughter, she really doesn't seem to care either way... </p><p></p><hr>

I'm 34 years old, which is young or old depending on your perspective (!) but I've definitely been around a few years, and with all the guys in contacts, have managed to meet very few highly nearsighted, cute guys over the years. So, from now on, if I see one who seems like he might have the slightest chance of being interested in me, I'm going to pounce!  (I don't have the chance to talk to -9 guys wearing their glasses every day, you know!)  When it comes to dating, I'm still shy about it, but I'm finding that when I let someone know about my fetish, it's usually no big deal.  They laugh and usually say they met someone else with another fetish (usually much more common---like feet or underwear.)   </p><p> </p><p>Sometimes when I try talking to someone about glasses it falls flat, but with this latest guy, he brought up that his glasses were thick when I complimented them, so he was opening up the conversation to go that direction. As for me, if someone compliments my glasses, I would never admit to being blind (unless I knew that person was a high myope as well). That's none of their business!  But if other guys are willing to open up like that to me, I'm all for it!!!!!  Go ahead, tell me how blind you are!!!   </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, my advice to others, particularly younger guys, (or gals for that matter) is, be bold!!! Because when I think back to my twenties, there were a number of guys I never mentioned my fetish to, that I probably should have.  About 10 years ago, I even broke up with a cute -7 guy because he got RK! (This was the pre-lasik days).  I hinted that I thought it was a bad idea, but never came out and said anything.  Of course, we would have to have been pretty serious for him to cancel the surgery for me!!!  But it was very important to me and I couldn't pursue the relationship when his cute thick glasses were gone!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 May 2002, 18:20</p><p>Had to call at somebody's house yesterday on business. The name and address didn't mean anything to me, but as I approached the front door I caught a glimpse of a guy in glasses. When he let me in it turned out I had some dealings with him and his wife in the past (like eight or nine years ago) and we've passed the time of day ever since. He's a well-preserved forty, with a tanned complexion, crisp black hair (not too short) and at the moment a little goatee beard, brown eyes, a nice smile - and is a really pleasant guy to talk to. He has always had plus glasses (around +2 maybe); I've seen him out bareyed quite a few times, but without his specs he has a slightly lost look - not squinting exactly, but a bit unfocussed. When I first met him he had back aviators; later on round dark wire frames; the latest are white wire, not oval or oblong but fairly narrow, and they certainly suit him. He made a remark about glasses at one point, but I failed to guide the conversation in the right direction, the way one does unless one is tinyeyes ::) </p><p>This afternoon in ASDA, I managed to get to a checkout manned by a tall guy with short black hair and round gold frames with a strong minus Rx - about 1/4 inch thick and lots of power rings. -7? -8? Another nice youg man. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 May 2002, 06:45</p><p>Nice one, tinyeyes - exactly your kind of sighting too! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>tinyeyes</b>&nbsp;27 May 2002, 00:04</p><p>I was going to post this on "Guys with Glasses" but this seems more the place for sightings....and I have a sighting to report...it was at the gym I work out at.   I walked in today and was immediately bowled over when I spotted this cute guy I've been seeing there for at least 2 years (and never spoken a word to)....he's probably early 30s, short curly dark hair, tall and slim but muscular, dark eyes, definitely cute and definitely gay...possibly Jewish, Italian or some such....WOW I just never expected to see him in glasses like he had on today.....medium small, rectangular wire rims, polished edges, high index but still with plenty of thick edge, his dark intense eyes quite tiny and surrounded by LOTS of cut-in.....OH MY GOD, he looked so good I got excited immediately.  There is just nothing I love more....this guy has been wearing powerful contacts every time I've seen him!!!   But not today....it was a coke bottle morning, and so I decided to check him out.  He started working on a "torso" machine and I got on a triceps machine (which I never use normally) to get a good look at him.  He ignored me completely, but I had a great view of his powerful specs as he intently worked out.  </p><p> </p><p>Now I'm normally very shy, but I'm beginning to change, and I was REALLY enjoying looking at him, so I threw caution to the wind, walked up to him, said Hi, and asked him about the machine he was using.  He was not exactly excited to be talking to me, but was friendly enough to offer advice about the machine and how to use it, so we chatted a little about that while I waited to use it and he continued. Then I struck:  I asked him his name and he said "Dan," and I told him mine and said I'd seen him there many times.  Then I said, "You don't normally wear glasses do you?"  (I can't believe I did this but hormones were at work.)  He said, "No, I didn't feel like putting my contacts in this morning."  I said, "You look great in glasses!"  And he gave me that doubtful look of someone who is not used to hearing that, and said flatly "They're thick." So I said, "I have a strong prescription too."  He seemed interested and asked what it was, then told me that he was "eight fifty and nine hundred"  (I'm not sure why some people say it that way....obviously he meant -8.5 and -9.0, which was a little lower than I would have guessed---the glasses looked so strong I would have thought he was pushing -10.)  That was basically the end of our glasses discussion, except for him saying, saracastically, "It's fun being blind!"  (Little does he know the irony of his statement for me.....nothing could be MORE fun than being blind!!  And he looks so good in his coke bottles!) I almost wore my specs to the gym today, but decided not to....I probably could have swapped with him. (I have a similar RX but I think this guy has me beat since the first numbers of my latest glasses are a mere -8.)  </p><p> </p><p>He was pretty cool toward me and walked away with a "Have a nice workout" or whatever....he didn't seem interested, but you can bet I will pay more attention to him if I see him again, even though he will almost certainly have powerful plastic sheaths on his eyeballs.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;21 May 2002, 15:55</p><p>Portia, </p><p> </p><p>Myopia (about -5 to 6 range for many years) not disappearing but sometimes not as easy to see closer, such as newspaper, with bottom of progressive bifocals.  Probably has to do with the small field and the large newspaper.  So, last several years find it easier to take glasses off and hold paper closer.  Never did this until some years after need for bifocals.  If I use my computer bifocals, regular not progressive, for reading all OK.  The bifocal is quite large but not executive.   </p><p> </p><p>Most myopes not boasting they don't need bifocals, they usually do need them and just don't admit it.  Then there is looking over and under, taking glasses off etc. </p><p> </p><p>Also know someone with moderate minus who needs exam and probably bifocals and won't go because he does not want stronger glasses and probably does not want bifocals.  He could have the exam and just not use the Rx.  That would satisfy his curiosity about both stronger glasses and the need for bifocals. </p><p> </p><p>Tommy</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;20 May 2002, 20:44</p><p>Tommy, did your increasing presbyopia make you feel as though your myopia was disappearing? </p><p> </p><p>Do you meet may myopes who boast that they never have needed bifocals?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tommy</b>&nbsp;20 May 2002, 16:17</p><p>Julian, </p><p> </p><p>Jules, enjoyed reading your sightings from Sunday.  Some comments: </p><p> </p><p>The young guy looking over the top of his glasses to read small print.  Often older myopes who are in need of bifocals do this.  I know a couple gay guys, one almost 60 and the other almost 70, both myopes not high minus, who are still resisting bifocals and look over, under and take glasses off and put back on constantly, most annoying.  Could the young guy be in need of bifocals? </p><p> </p><p>The male of the young couple with the nice hands who probably wore contacts the night before and with glasses the next day holding things close to read.   </p><p>I would think if he were doing that he would take the glasses off to see print better close up.  One often sees those with strong minus, even with bifocals take off glasses to see close up, not hold things closer with glasses on.  Being myopic one can always see close up, sometimes very close, without glasses, even with a high minus.  I am about a -6 with +2.50 and without glasses can read a typed sheet or newspaper about 9 inches away.  Would those with a plus Rx hold things closer with glasses on to see better?  Not sure how the plus thing works. </p><p> </p><p>Will post separately about your BwG fiction.  Yes, I like your way of expressing it better than what I used. </p><p> </p><p>Tommy </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;20 May 2002, 16:15</p><p>Nice sightings, Jules. Had a good one myself: a rather hunky American guy, dark hair, baseball cap, blue eyes, in a sunglasses shop. He asked to see some Retro Ray-Ban shades and then had to whip off his -5 specs to try them on. Nose close to the mirror, of course, and then he did something cute. His oval regular glasses in his hand, he started talking to the shop assistant, and moved his head closer to hers so he could focus. He was saying "I'd need prescription lenses in the sunglasses" and I thought: you're not kidding. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 May 2002, 12:29</p><p>Oh my children, what a weekend for sightings! </p><p>Sunday lunch in a pub, not one of my regular places. The manager, behind the bar, was slightly chubby, slightly fair, and a bit more than slightly myopic - nothing fantastic, you understand, but enough to show the beginning of power rings and a bit of edge thickness in his gold ovals. The customers included several nice young men in jeans, T-shirts and round or oval glasses; the nicest of all was at the next table: tall, slim, dark-haired, black-covered ovals with a low minus Rx (but not as low as I thought at first glance). When he went to the bar to pay the bill it was evident his jeans were well-filled, especially at the rear. Another interesting sight at the bar (but he went off in the opposite direction, to the smoking section) was a youth in narrow rectangular black plastic frames with very heavy temples, a bit Buddy Holly-ish, with really strong lenses. Curiously, at that distance there was no doubt they were strong, but it wasn't so easy to tell if they were high plus or high minus...I suppose in both cases the image is reduced, but with plus lenses it's inverted. All I saw at first glance was a lot of sunlight refracted through them. I'd bet they were minus - but I might lose. </p><p>Then this afternoon I popped into the local ASDA for a few items, and was diverted by the sight of a teenage lad who was shopping with (I imagine) his mother and sister. He had fair hair, a pleasantly ugly face, a cheeky grin and bright eyes that looked out through lenses of about -2 with, I think, a good bit of cylinder. The frames were white metal oblongs I'd have thought too adult for him - but they looked great on him; he obviously has taste. At the same time, and usually in the same gangway, a stout young guy with dark hair, a high colour, and low minus lenses in round black wire frames. The curious thing about him was that several times I saw him pick up an item and read the small print before deciding to buy it. To do this he looked over the top of his glasses and held it about four inches from his eyes. I thought that a bit odd. </p><p>The gem of the whole weekend, however...last night I met a young couple briefly; he was tall, dark and slim but not particularly interesting. This morning he rang up asking if they could discuss some business with me. We sorted out a rendezvous, and as I made my way there I thought idly how nice it would be if he was wearing glasses. Well, HE WAS! Black or at any rate very dark wire frames, sort of trapezoidal I guess, with the fancy temples that are common these days. -3, maybe even -4; I don't want to exaggerate, but he must have had contacts in last night, he couldn't function easily without correction. His face was nothing special, but as we talked I noticed he had beautiful hands - long fingers, like many pianists and organists. Another thing that struck me: when he referred to papers he held them close-ish. I couldn't believe his specs weren't strong enough; they looked new. Is it a habit short sighted people get into? Tell me, some of you! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;18 May 2002, 02:25</p><p>1. I've been away part of this week (not a lot to write home about) and find on returning that the sexy spexy postman is back on duty; shame I've been missing the sight. Discovered in a brief conversation that he's on this round one week on and five weeks off. </p><p>2. First thing this morning (I was in the car) a young man I've never seen before, going into the paper shop (newsagents to those who don't speak the lingo) in sweater, slacks and maybe even carpet slippers - nipping round for a paper in other words. Dark wire frames, minus lenses. Wonder if he's a new inhabitant. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 May 2002, 13:54</p><p>This afternoon, wandering round the gardens of a stately home, I noticed a family: parents, not more than 40 I guess, and two young boys, 10 to early teens at a guess. Both parents wore minus glasses, dad's were quite strong; so I wondered if the boys were inheriting their parents' myopia. No sign with the younger (give him time); but the older one, just occasionally, gave a little squint when he looked into the distance. A few months, a year maybe, and I reckon he'll be struggling to read the blackboard with all that that entails. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 May 2002, 13:07</p><p>Time was when police officers who needed glasses had to have a standard frame, pretty much the kind of thing I was wearing thirty years ago. No longer! </p><p>Last night I was driving past a derelict factory where some kids were climbing up the walls, and a police car was on the spot. The bobby who was dealing with the kids was a fine figure of a man; tall, slim, broad-shouldered, fair complexion and short fair hair. Looked wonderful in his blue uniformr shirt. And glasses. Biggish oblong frames, gunmetal coloured. Quite made my evening even if I didn't get to see his lenses. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;09 May 2002, 21:02</p><p>A "Tommy" comes along one in a while to Eyescene and makes things interesting for awhile!  </p><p> </p><p>How many times have we checked in and found no one had been around for days? </p><p> </p><p>Interested in glasses and at least semi-literate? Post away!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 May 2002, 05:43</p><p>Right then, I shall jot a bit. </p><p>Yesterday morning a small fairish youth with a bit of acne. Preppy round glasses, plastic covered with gold temples. Very ordinary - but perfect for him. Those rounds and ovals still have something going for them. </p><p>More and more of the Pakistani lads round here seem to be appearing in glasses: mostly oval, either gold or black; very becoming in most cases; almost invariably minus. </p><p>Did I mention three Pakistani (or maybe Kashmiri) brothers recently? I know I've jotted about them a long time ago. The eldest and most heavily built (married with kids) I've never seen in glasses but in view of his brothers' eyesight I wonder if he wears contacts. The second has always worn minus glasses with a significant Rx. The youngest (slimmest, and best-looking when he presents himself right) likewise. I guess he's at college or university these days; but when I saw him the other day his hair was very long and all over the place, his frames were very wide, and his lenses a mass of power rings. he is definitely the high myope of the family - really nice if he sorted his hair, and maybe tried different frames. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 May 2002, 13:18</p><p>I posted on 20 April about an engaging little guy in blue denim. I've seen him a couple of times since and observed a bit more. His eyes are deep-set (and have a tired look, but then he's a recent parent!) and his glasses sit some way from his eyes. But the striking thing is that his black frames are very noticeable at a distance. Being me, I can't imagine anybody looking at him and not immediately thinking "Ooh! Spexy - and sexy!" </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 May 2002, 13:10</p><p>Another trip to London the other day. In the Royal Bank of Scotland at Notting Hill Gate, a breathtaking glimpse of a young man with a fair complexion that had caught the sun, garnished with oval rimless specs, modest minus. Sad it was only a glimpse. </p><p>A few minutes later, near Waterstone's bookshop on Bayswater Road, two young guys with backpacks. One of them, with fair hair, pale complexion, black T-shirt, wore glasses with black plastic frames and minus lenses, obviously pretty new. A retro style that's come back. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2002, 00:26</p><p>Back home and on a bus yesterday. A guy of about 20, student maybe, with black hair, black shirt, black pants, black shoes - don't know about his socks :;) - in animated conversation with a little blonde girl. As you can imagine I wouldn't be mentioning him here id he hadn't worn glasses: biggish round wire frames, covered in NOT black but mottled plastic. Modest minus Rx, -2 at the most. Shouldn't have bothered mentioning him if I hadn't been on the same bus for twenty minutes and watched his frequent smiles. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2002, 00:20</p><p>Another trip to London, and an overnight stay. As usual spexy guys in abundance, a few hot, some barely even cool. Two stand out from the crowd... </p><p>Thursday morning the westbound traffic on the Strand and Whitehall was getting nowhere and it was quicker to walk from Covent Garden to Westminster. I eventually discovered there had been wreath-laying at the Cenotaph - it was ANZAC day - quite a few Australian uniforms around, and lots of people wearing poppies, which are usually a November thing. The bells of St Martin-in-the-Fields were ringing, and when I got to the Abbey there was something happening there too. (A couple of boys in glasses at Westminster School but I didn't get a proper look.) </p><p>On the way along the Strand  I spotted this tall guy in front of me: blue jeans, black T-shirt, glasses. Honestly, when he walked it was like two ferrets fighting in a bag! He stopped at a shop and as I passed I could see the specs had round or maybe octagonal black wire frames and significant minus lenses. Then he crossed the road through the unmoving traffic and vanished for ever. </p><p>Later on, after four in the afternoon, at Temple tube station, two teenage boys went down the stairs in front of me. The first thing I noticed about them was that the smaller and plumper of the two had a lace of his trainers undone and I was about to warn him when he stopped to tie it. The other lad, taller and slim, had a bright green sweatshirt and flaming red hair cut short, and was wearing glasses with round black wire frames on top of his head (I'd have thought the lenses would get greasy). His lenses were strongish plus...I guess at his age he can see OK bareyed, but needs to have his specs handy - for what eventuality, I wonder? I'd have liked to observe some more but my train came and the boys didn't board it. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2002, 00:17</p><p>There's a young guy lives round the corner here - I've mentioned him before but not recently - not one of the two blonde teenagers I have trouble telling apart; he must be well into his twenties. Anyway, he's tall and slim with fairish hair, has always worn glasses with a strongish plus Rx, and has never, in a district where most people are quite friendly, said 'Good morning' or even looked my way. My theory is his mummy must have warned him about men like me :;( </p><p>Anyway, ten years ago he was a scruffy teenager with floppy hair and round wire specs, sometimes black covered and sometimes not. A year or two back he went into ovals instead, and that was a distinct improvement. This week I've seen him twice (after a long interval; perhaps he's working away) so much more smartly dressed that it was only at the second sighting I was sure it was the same guy, and in distinctly sexy semi-rimless specs. Oh yes, I was forgetting: hair close cropped, and that suited him too. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2002, 00:10</p><p>...and of course the pretty postman has disappeared without trace and been replaced with a much less interesting guy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2002, 00:06</p><p>First jotting for a while; there's been nothing outstanding to jot about. But last night I had a conversation with a guy: quite short, maybe 5'7"; fairish hair, fairly spiky but not with dressing or anything, attempting a beard and might yet succeed. Dressed in blue denim to match his eyes (well, not quite). Teeth spaced apart. Very shiny new glasses, looked like plano fronts but the lenses though strong didn't seem that strong. Black-covered wire frames, sort of rounded-off rectangular you might call them. Temples white metal and decorated a bit. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2002, 09:25</p><p>Lunch yesterday in a pub about fifty miles from here (no, not Staffordshire, Leicestershire, and if this sounds a typical Jules piece I don't care) where there was a very young barman I'd classify as easy on the eye but slow on the uptake (clear creamy complexion, very short dark hair, slim figure, big dark eyes that I thought were brown but then in another light looked blue). He didn't wear glasses and I kept watching to see if he squinted at all so that I could mention him here. But he didn't, so I can't. Pity! </p><p>Meanwhile a passing glimpse of another customer: tall, shoulder length dark hair, and glasses with big round frames in black wire. Nice. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2002, 00:40</p><p>Another encounter with the postman, which I didn't contrive; he was right there when I left the house. He was bare-headed this time (baseball cap the day before) and his hair is parted in the centre and flat down the sides to the ponytail (which reaches well down his back). I'm almost certain he was wearing a different pair of specs this time; there seemed to be white wire round the lenses, and as he bent over to sort out my mail I could see a suggestion of rings in the lenses. More as and when... </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2002, 03:32</p><p>A quick update on the postman; I had a conversation (less than one minute) with him when I contrived to arrive at my front door as he was posting the mail in. His complexion is browner than I originally thought and he has rather heavy jowls, complete with the stubble. The specs are semi-rimless, dark brown and very fine wire - bit like mine (which are not semi-rimless). The lenses are weaker than I thought, around -1 I guess. I shall keep on observing and post anything else significant. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2002, 09:06</p><p>Hi, it's me again; a long time since I posted two sightings in a day, but I had one of those lovely glimpses this afternoon. Three Pakistani lads, mid to late teens, loitering around town. One of them, lean with chiselled features, would have been worth a second look even if he hadn't been wearing glasses: oval frames in black wire, which complemented his black hair perfectly. No chance of getting close enough to check out his lenses, but I'd be prepared to bet a small sum they were minus - they always are. Almost without exception spexy Paki lads seem to be myopes - anyone know if there's a racial tendency that way? </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2002, 04:12</p><p>We've had a new postman round here the last few days - they seem to chop and change pretty often. Yesterday I caught sight of a youthful figure and glasses, this morning I was coming along the street as he delivered my mail, and I could see a pony tail as well. Later on this morning I drove past as he was delivering round the corner: straight dark hair in a long pony tail; pale complexion; designer stubble (or maybe he just hadn't shaved for a day or three); rimless or semi-rimless glasses with minus lenses, not (I thought) the lowest Rx in the world. Not a great beauty, but I shall keep on observing, especially his specs which may be interesting, and post more when I know more. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2002, 02:11</p><p>Have had a guy working with me this last week; younger than me, fortyish maybe. Round metal frames with pretty powerful minus lenses - pretty powerful meaning minus six or seven I guess. Several times I've come by when he was reading something with his glasses well down his nose, and when he's looked up to speak to me he's pushed them up closer to his eyes. Bifocals next time I guess. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2002, 16:34</p><p>Nice one this afternoon: I had to call in at a junior school after class hours, and there was a slim youth, too old to be a pupil, hanging round in the entrance lobby fiddling with a mobile phone. Pale complexion, short straight red hair. Low minus lenses in white letal frames with black (dark anyway) plastic temples. Turned out to be the son of one of the teachers - but definitely worth writing ome about. That's why I'm posting him here ::)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2002, 12:59</p><p>Scribbling into my palmtop on the London train...I'm glancing round a crowded carriage where there are a few interesting BwGs* with plus Rxs (again!) and speculating whether they'll take them off when we get to Euston. </p><p>A little way off a guy in a bright blue shirt and a black and gold checked tie (uniform?) with dark hair and brown eyes has worked on a laptop. Smallish round gunmetal frames, low plus - but he's taken them off already. </p><p>Across the gangway a fairer guy. Rimless, not too strong. I'm reserving judgment. (In the event he kept them on - come to think of it they were almost certainly stronger than mine.) </p><p>Further away, and nicest of all, a tall slim guy with short fair hair, and animated expression, and brown wire frames, approximately oval. When I passed on my way back from the loo I could see there's a decent amount of cylinder there, and I've got him rated as a full time wearer even though there isn't so much sphere. (I was right about that). </p><p>Later...that was all that was jottable this trip. </p><p>* Note: I'm going to use BwG as the male equivalent of GwG. 'Guy with glasses' would abbreviate to the same thing, and 'guy who wears glasses' (GwwG) would be too confusing. Do feel free to follow my example if you want to. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2002, 05:23</p><p>Mothering Sunday - a big crowd in church this morning, including several who'd come a distance to be in church with parents. One lady had with her both her daughter (with delicious but non-spexy husband) and son (without his wife) - both tall, well-built and fair. Son has long straight hair in a pony-tail and, for the first time that I know of, glasses! Gunmetal frames, low minus lenses, could easily be his first pair (he's in his mid-20s). Quite lovely! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Mar 2002, 08:45</p><p>Not a lot to see on the train to London the other day...opposite me a thin guy, probably under 40 but very bald, pleasant when we began to talk, who worked first on papers and then on a laptop through low minus lenses, oval in shape but set in a semi-rimless frame that made them look not-oval (the fact that he used the laptop without taking them off encourages the belief he was under 40 tho' of course they could have been progressives). Next to me was a blonde lady, suicide blonde possibly (you know: dyed by her own hand) who left a pair of specs with black wire frames and minus lenses lying on the table in front of her while she read her book and when she went to the buffet bar or the loo or somewhere, but put them on as we approached Euston. </p><p>Had lunch that day in a pub that claims Shakespeare and Dickens as former patrons. Sat outside as it was quite mild (this was Thursday). Plates, glasses and so on were being collected up by a scruffy-looking youth who was trying unsuccessfully to grow a beard. No mistake about it, he wouldn't have seen much without his glasses: white metal frames, lenses -5 or more I guess. Apart from I wouldn't have looked twice at him; as it was I looked a dozen times. </p><p>At another pub later on, a variety of patrons in a variety of specs. One guy in a smart suit with wide frames that looked like brushed stainless steel. </p><p>On the train home a variety of ovals or near-ovals (a lot of frames these days aren't the pure oval but squared off a bit or sort of hexagonal or something). </p><p>A couple of seats from me a tall youth with spiky hair, slightly boss-eyed with plus lenses in dark oval-ish frames. Beyond him another, taller but tidier about the hair; similar frames but I couldn't guess the Rx. On the other side a fair lad with short hair and gold ovals, lowish minus I thought. Finally, directly opposite me, an oriental lad with masses of black hair (Thai perhaps) who slept most of the way but wore low minus lenses in delicate silvery frames. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2002, 16:15</p><p>'What a day this has bin, what a great mood I'm in...' </p><p>I was beginning to think today must be National Hyperopia Day...I posted already about the guy I saw driving a van this morning, and then later on I went to the railway station to get tickets for my next couple of London trips. On the way I passed through some university buildings while a lot of students were movng around, and ALL the guys in glasses I saw had plus lenses, a couple of the quite strong. It made a change! Then up to Sainsburys, where the sightings included a young assistant with short, crisp wavy black hair and rosy cheeks, wearing big plastic aviators coloured brown at the top and clear at the bottom and over the nose with a substantial Rx - I'm guessing +2 or +3. The puzzle is why such a good-looking youth would wear such dreary specs. As I said once before in a similar situation, they could almost have been his grandad's readers. Finally another customer at one of the checkouts with pebble lenses like the driver's in the morning, but gold wire frames. </p><p>Later I remembered I'd forgotten to get the stuff I actually went into Sainsburys for, so I nipped into the local ASDA, where everything was different again. There was a tall guy with short fair hair stacking shelves at the back with strong (well, -4, -5 or so) MINUS lenses in oval plastic frames, dark-coloured but the colour was only a layer on clear plastic - kind of thing I haven't seen in decades. Then a customer: dark, rosy-cheeked lad with a wife(?) who also wore glasses. He had black wire ovals a bit far down his nose for efficient correction of his myopia (-2, -3, something like that). Fnally, at the next checkout to mine, a tall, handsome Pakistani with really strong minus lenses in oblong wire and black plastic frame. </p><p>Don't know when I last had such a day of sightings; it was all quite exciting! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2002, 04:39</p><p>As I was waiting to turn into a car park this morning a van passed, driven by a cute youth with a high colour and real pebbles of plus lenses in black wire frames. That's all I saw of him - ships that pass in the night! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2002, 02:55</p><p>Yesterday in a Pup near my home. </p><p>I went in the bar for go take a Drink (selfservice), when I wait for this drink I look a little bit around me and I saw from behind a young people, for the moment I not was shure it's a Boy or a girl, because the person had long brown and nice hairs, after looking more I saw - yes - it's a Boy in Bluejeans and a black leatherjacket. I go back to my table and start to look around, because I not was interested in this Boy, however that will change quickly. After a moment his conversationpartner went to the toilet and then "my" Boy" turn to the direction to me. Oh my God, he wear glasses and I can see from far, about 10 m that he had pluslenses in a old stylish frame. I drink quickly my Drink finish and go again to the Bar, however for see the glassesboy from near. I go to a position that I can see his face with big hoping, that I must wait long time for my drink. I saw, that he wear strong pluslenses (about +4-5 I guess) and the frame was very nice with a middlesized form (rectanglar-oval) however in a colorstyle like the sixties. The upper part in black/drakgrey and the lower part white transvisible, I hope you know what I mean. And in all he was a real cutie, about 22 y.o. Hope to see him soon. </p><p> </p><p>Greeting from Singa </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2002, 12:45</p><p>Just been to the pub for an early evening drink - the local rugby club was there in force. The only really jottable one was a guy in his thirties I guess, faily slim with a pale complexion and fairish hair cut short; it looked like a crew cut that had been allowed to grow to an inch long. Oblong rimless specs, low minus. Nice.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2002, 09:42</p><p>Same as I say Dom, there are as many varieties of fetish as there are fetishists. Must keep my eyes open for higher myopes sans specs - you never know, it might be more of a turn-on than I expect. But as I've said so many times before, I have a special liking for low Rx's. I reckon a guy who could manage without his glasses is doing me a favour by wearing them. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2002, 04:17</p><p>But let's not forget the heavy squint of the -4 myope, or the sexy "blank look" of the bare-eyed -8 guy. For reasons I cannot fatham, I get a real kick out of cute guys sans specs in the locker room, sticking their heads right up to the lockers so they get the right one. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kix</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2002, 22:25</p><p>Pip-- </p><p>For whatever reason, watching a guy squint, even very slightly, has for whatever reason always fascinated me. I have never been able to pin down precisely why, as I love catching a good looking guy in glasses very much as well. Even in school I remember taking note of other students who I suspected to be myopic. My boyfriend now is mildly myopic (very mildly--he only needs glasses to drive at night and for watching some tv). It drives me wild to watch him narrow his eyes a little to see a sports score or some small print on the screen (and in some cases, the inevitable reach for his glasses). He knows that I think he looks cute when he squints but I don't think he knows just *how much* I like it. And I'm not so sure I could tell him without him thinking I was a little odd... </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2002, 07:04</p><p>VERY good question, Pip. From time to time we've discussed this on Eye Scene: a good many of us enjoy the sight of a good-looking guy struggling to penetrate the blur a few feet away, but there are as many varieties of a fetish as there are fetishists. Dominic has a particular fancy for myopic guys bare-eyed, the more myopic the better. My conclusion in the past has been that even better is the sight of him in his first glasses, eyes wide open, face alight; but that little squint has an appeal all its own. It's a bit like the place In 'Winnie-the-Pooh' or the sequel where Christopher Robin or someone asks Pooh what he likes doing best. He's about to say "eating honey" but then thinks there's a moment just before he starts eating honey that is even better, but he doesn't know what it's called. (Anticipation perhaps, but that's a tall order for a bear of very little brain).  </p><p>I've mentioned a couple of times a very ornamental young colleague whose white metal ovals suit him particularly well; I think the lenses are high index and stronger than a first glance would suggest. I would be very interested in seeing him bareyed and squinting. (Incidentally he's very homophobic, but one of our female colleagues says "methinks the lady doth protest too much" ::) On the other hand another colleague with whom I work a lot more closely is in his early 40s and has reading glasses which I've only once seen him wearing. When he holds the book or paper a bit further away I note it with interest and appreciation, but not excitement. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pip</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2002, 14:47</p><p>Julian et al </p><p>Often in these postings i detect you seem to enjoy witnessing the squint of the uncorrected eye. So is the "I can't quite see it" squint more appealing than a full on spex wearer? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2002, 12:56</p><p>On 'The Weakest Link' on BBC-2 yesterday, the guy who finally won was quite good-looking with short chestnut hair and - I don't know. Was he growing a beard? had he just not shaved? or would you call it designer stubble? Anyway, whenever he looked at Anne Robinson, it would be an exaggeration to say he squinted, but there was just that hint that a small minus correction wouldn't come amiss. Nice. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2002, 02:14</p><p>A frustrating morning. It was raining heavily when I went out this morning so I put my glasses in my pocket. On the way up the street I saw a very handsome young guy I know slightly get out of his car and go into his house. He wears glasses some of the time and always when he's driving: my original impression was that they were low plus, but I've never managed to get a proper look. (Problem wasn't that I didn't have mine on; he was about 100 yards away!). Couple of minutes later, a youth in working clothes passed on the other side. He was definitely wearing glasses (protected by a baseball cap) but I couldn't see the details without my low plus specs ::( </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2002, 13:40</p><p>Oh, my typing - and I checked that last post too!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2002, 13:38</p><p>London on Thursdasy as promised...nothing much on the train going, and nothing really till around lunchtime I was on Victoria main line station getting something to eat. A big red-haired guy approaching the departures board pulled a case out of his pocket and put on a pair of moderate minus glasses in wire frames; and, having once put them on, didn't seem to be in any hurry to take them off. Then all of a sudden there were young men in sexy low minus glasses everywhere, too many to describe. </p><p>As I passed Westminster School (a favourite spot for sightings as the old stagers here will remember) only a few boys in sight - but, as always, the two or three with glasses were all short-sighted, and wearing very smart wire frames. </p><p>On the train back home a guy sat down opposite me, got out an Apple G3 PowerBook and started work. He was casually not to say scruffily dressed, with long untidy reddish hair, but a very smart pair of rimless specs. Lowish minus, edges around 3 mm thick. They didn't quite fit the rest of his get-up, and I find myself wondering what sort of glasses I'd have expected him to wear. Round gold wire, maybe, rather NHS looking? </p><p>Shopping in Tesco on Friday night. Checked out the tall guy in the bakery department who wears just a line of beard all round his chin and black wore frames; but was most interested in a tall spotty youth with dark hair a beautiful pair of rimless ovals with possibly -3. His glasses were a lot sexier than he was, but I suppose where there's myopia there's hope. In the non-smking room of the excellent pub round the corner afterwards, a big hefty guy, rugby player maybe, with tinted or maybe photochromic lenses, not negligible but not high minus, in round mottled plastic-covered wire frames. There was something about the way they sat on his face that suggested he might wear contacts at work all day and relax in his sexy spex at night. Across the room a thin guy with tiny round black frames, enough minus to show cut-in. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;10 Feb 2002, 23:45</p><p>Saturday whean I drive home after shopping - lot of traffic - I must stop many times for short time. I listen Radio and watching the people walking outside. From far I saw a young Boy, maba 180 ch tall and when him come more near I saw, him from Asia and he wear a very big black plasticframe glasses with very weak pluslenses (mabe 0.50 - 0.75 I guess) However he look very sexy for me with his glasses. I never saw a young Men with so big glasses, mabe this style will become fashion again. </p><p> </p><p>To bobby: When I was last year in Cesky Krumlov I saw a lot of Vietnampeople, they are many shopowners (shoes, electronic, cloths) and I saw also many womans and mens from Vietnam with glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Greetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2002, 08:30</p><p>Down to the railway station this lunch time to get the ticket for my next London trip (you never know, there might be a sighting or two to come!) There were no trains running because of track maintenance; everybody was being bussed to other places to make their connections. Caught sight of a tall slim guy looking up at one of the monitors and *thought* he was just coming out of a squint, but couldn't be sure. When I joined the queue for tickets he was right in front of me, so I observed as carefully but discreetly as I could. He was, as I said, tall and slim with a fawn roll-neck sweater, spiky dark hair and a nice trim figure. Silver ring on his wedding finger and another on the middle finger of his right hand. He looked in every direction without any sign of difficulty; I gave up hope and idly began to try to see if he was wearing contacts. Then he looked at the map of the Virgin Trains network behind the counter, where the station names are printed in much smaller type, and there was a *definite* squint. Patience rewarded - and nice.... </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;09 Feb 2002, 02:17</p><p>There are many immigrants from Viet-nam in my country (probably about 100 thousand or even more), but very few of them wear glasses. I like Vietnamese girls, but unfortunately I still have not seen any with strong glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2002, 15:03</p><p>Nice one as I finished shopping at Tesco the other day: four young Asian guys, not Indian/Pakistani, not Chinese or Japanese - wondered if they were Vietnamese or possibly Korean. All different heights. The tallest, over six feet, wore glasses with dark wire frames and minus lenses, I think (his hair was all over the place and that made it difficult to be sure). The middle two, nothing; but the smallest, maybe five five, was MEGA myopic and wore oval rimless...I just thought you'd like to know. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2002, 08:11</p><p>Like many OOs, I find it hard to resist dropping into an optician's if I see someone cute in there, and the other day I had a glorious sighting. Three Chinese kids, two boys, one girl, all myopic, were wandering round the showroom trying on specs. The shorter of the two boys had the sweetest boyish face, and a neatly cut fringe of black hair; his specs were aviators and thick - perhaps  minus 8. The optician's assistant was a Chinese girl who knew these three; she teased the boy about his old-fashioned specs, and persuaded him to try on lots of oval frames. Boy, was he blind! He had to hold the frames right up to his face to see them, squinting all the time, and when he looked in the mirror his nose almost touched the glass. But the best bit when when the assistant walked away with his specs to measure them; he was so short-sighted that he couldn't see where she had gone, and he almost groped his way around the shop. What made it sweet was that this boy made a joke out of his myopia - after all, his friends were all specs-wearers, too. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2002, 02:58</p><p>Sorry if I'm not making myself clear, Singa.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2002, 05:48</p><p>Singa: would you expect to see many boys in glasses in a gay bar? Wouldn't most of them avoid wearing their glasses - I knew a couple who always took them off before going to a gay bar or club; one was -5 and he braved the discomfort of changing into contacts, the other had a lower Rx and he went bareyed and squinted. </p><p>The last time I was in a gay bar was fifteen months ago in Paris, and apart from the guys I was with, who were there for the ambience rather than for sex, there was only one spexy guy in the whole place: a pretty little Jewish boy who looked as if he was doing pretty well, glasses or no glasses. One of my friends could easily have been mistaken for a Hasidic Jew, and the kid got rather anxious.

When I go to the second I order a beer and looked around in the bar, no glasses boys. After about 15 minutes a group of 3 boys (about 19-21 y.o.) come in, 1 of them very tall, with colorized blond hairs and with a oval black plastic frame and as I can guess about - 5 lenses both sides. After a while a other boy from this group took the glasses from this boy and put it on his nose and I say: oh this glasses are quiet more strong, than you old glasses, after that also the other Boy will try this glasses, however the glassesboy took quickly his glasses and say to him: I will back my glasses, because I can see nothing without them. I think, that this 2 Boys see the glassesboy the first time with his new glasses. A very good sighting for me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2002, 13:10</p><p>Been on a day course for senior staff and trainees...one or two interesting sightings: </p><p>One tall young man, quite slim with short black hair, pale complexion and a nice smile. Specs that suited him a treat: round black wire frames, and, as far as I could tell, low minus Rx (though there might have been some cylinder there too, I couldn't observe as closely as I'd have liked). He appeared to be a full time wearer though I can't be certain; he took them off during lunch and left them on the table... </p><p>Another, a lot less tall, a lot less dark, hair a lot less short, minus Rx a lot less low - but put them only when there was someting to read on the OHP screen. Curious the different ways people use them... </p><p>The the pretty boy in his twenties I've mentioned before: close-cropped fair hair, slightly elaborate white wire ovals, hi-index lenses, stronger (minus) than they look. Never seen him without them... </p><p>Another one I know, a bit older, sallow complexion, gold frames, plus lenses, stronger than mine. Glases on all day; had I not known him I'd have put him down as a full time wearer, but I know he isn't...maybe the first guy I mentioned isn't either. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2002, 14:14</p><p>A few interesting sightings today tho' the weather's been pretty foul. </p><p>In town this afternoon a slim guy dressed in black was approaching and went into a solicitor's office. As he got to the door he put on a very becoming pair of glasses: black wire ovals, low minus with cylinder. </p><p>In Tesco this evening, three young guys shpping for a party I should think: vodka, coke and Foster's lager (aarrgghh!). Two of them were big and hefty, the third less so, but not small. He had untidy dark hair, a goatee beard and unshaven areas around it, and glasses. Black plastic ovals, with shiny white metal temples, each like two pieces of wire with a gap between. Instead of bending down over his ears they curved gently and were presumably meant to hold the sides of his head. That wasn't working though. The spoecs were obviously new and need adjusting; but if he wants to look good in them he ought to smarten up. Oh yes, his Rx - I'm guessing -5 or -6. </p><p>Then to ASDA for a couple of items I couldn't get in Tesco: chubby kid with, for his age, very strong minus lenses in kind of oblong wire frames; a lean sallow guy with plus lenses in gold frames; and a big butch blond guy stacking shelves. Gold frames that kind of toned down the butch image but suited him a treat. Couldn't get to see the lenses. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;19 Jan 2002, 03:25</p><p>Spent part of this week living and working with </p><p>a slim and quite good looking guy a few years older than me, white hair cut short, bifocals, low minus in the top half, low plus in the reading segment, white metal with heavy light-coloured plastic temples... </p><p>a tall, very thin and handsome guy a few years younger than me; round glasses, wire covered with mottled plastic, trifocals (yes, Portia!) minus, not very strong but the bottom segments still minus. He was often bareyed for near work... </p><p>Both of these I knew already, but also... </p><p>a much younger guy, slim with very nice legs. No glasses, but I was pretty sure he was wearing contacts. </p><p>Then I came home and went shopping at Tesco - not for the first tiem, lots of guys in oval frames and minus lenses... </p><p>Then to the pub which was much the same. One guy in big aviator frames (gold) with high minus lenses. I found them a real passion-killer; some folks here would have loved them, but I thought there was no imagination about them! (Wonder how long he's had them) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2002, 21:02</p><p>oops, could I have posted this to the wrong forum....maybe not, Julian and his cohorts will help me sort out my multilensed customers...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2002, 21:00</p><p>I have a new customer in trifocals whose wife is in bifocals. </p><p> </p><p>Can anyone here tell me the likelyhood of encountering anyone in TRIFOCALS?  </p><p> </p><p>This is clearly a man who wants to see where's he's going and where he has been before, but can anyone define a trifocal-personality type and give me a sense of where he might like to live?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2002, 01:44</p><p>Thanks Christy - that was the one; somehow I'd got it in my head it was more recent than that. Somehow it seems less peculiar when presbyopes do it with their readers - but then there are the others who DON'T have their readers made up with half frames but DO go around wearing them indoors and squinting out under their eyebrows to see longer distances. (Sorry about the CAPITALS but HTML tags don't seem to work here.) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;13 Jan 2002, 01:08</p><p>Julian - would it be my posting under Acuity &amp; Prescription? Christy 04 Jan 2002, 23:51. </p><p>I don't expect everyone to be like me and enjoy full-time wear - and I'm quite happy for people to go in for part-time wear - but that two-second constant on-off wear really annoys me!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;12 Jan 2002, 17:56</p><p>I've been hunting round the recent threads but can't find the reference to a woman who kept putting her glasses on for an instant when she wanted to see something. I wanted to comment that in the pub tonight I saw a guy put his readers on three times in two minutes and each time take them off and put them away. The third time he was holding a cigarette packet at arm's length trying to read the small print but couldn't. Does that seem as odd, or not?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2002, 23:36</p><p>Nice one in the supermarket yesterday (ASDA this time). I had just rushed in there to get a couple of things but was distracted by the sight of a young couple near the newspaper shelves. He was small and neat, dressed in a black leather jacket, pale complexion, a good head of dark hair (nice to start with, in other words) and the most beautiful glasses. Well, I say that: they were only round black frames with gold temples, a bit heavier all over than usual, but on him they looked like jewellery. At first sight I expected minus lenses, but no, they were plus with a decent bit of cylinder. Not high plus, but significant. The young lady was actually (or seemed) taller; she wore oblong black frames, also with a plus Rx. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2002, 23:19</p><p>That address should definitely have been julianmungo@yahoo.co.uk. No other address will get me now. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2001, 03:41</p><p>Yes, I think I've heard the same play: an old man who attended funerals as a hobby was assumed by one of the funeral party to be the "other man" and her attack on him led to a romance. That the one? I susoect Thora Hird may have featured in it - certainly her kind of comedy. As for the guide, tell me more (by email if you like: julianmungo@yahoo.com) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2001, 03:36</p><p>Hmmm - you could be a 'professional mourner' - scanning those small print obituaries to spot the one offering the best nosh-up afterwards. Once listened to a radio play along those lines! Ever heard of the 'Dead Good Funeral Guide' which offers an 'alternative' type of funeral?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2001, 03:30</p><p>PPS: when I come to think of it, the most boring funeral I've ever attended was a non-religious one, conducted by a guy from the British Humanist Association. (There was a beautiful young man in glasses there though) </p><p>J</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2001, 01:26</p><p>Nice little vignette yesterday as I drove out of my gate and turned up the street. About 100 yards up the road a couple of Pakistani lads (16? 18?) had managed to gather enough snow to make and throw snowballs. One of them, light-skinned and about 6 feet tall, moved off in our direction at a brisk walk. Another ten seconds and I saw he was smoking a cigarette; another ten and he pulled out a smart pair of semi-rimless glasses, held them up to the light, put them on, glanced around with a contented expression, and carried on past us, wearing them. No chance to see the lenses, but his manner suggested the distance had just jumped into focus.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2001, 01:25</p><p>PS: they certainly can be boring - another good reason for keeping my eyes open and my glassses clean on the off chance of an interesting guy in interesting specs. </p><p>J</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;31 Dec 2001, 01:08</p><p>Portia, you left out quite a few possibilities: social worker? solicitor? local copy reporter? residential home manager? district nurse? home care worker? I'm not talking - and I'm not asking about your professional interest in obituaries ::) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2001, 22:07</p><p>Julian, still curious about the funeral attendance part of your job. Are you a "funeral industry worker" or some such politically correct title? Journalist? Meatwagon (hearse or ambulance)driver? Policeman? Professional Pallbearer? Clergyman? </p><p> </p><p>I have professional reasons for reading the obituaries very closely (and what tiny typeface in the paid obits) but I can accomplish my objectives without going to funerals.  </p><p> </p><p>They must become just another boring religious service after a while.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2001, 04:27</p><p>My job involves attending a lot of funerals - they are as you say better opportunities for lenswatching than most, though as my posts show I've taken other opportunities these last few days. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2001, 00:12</p><p>Julian, why do you go to so many funerals? </p><p> </p><p>As with any religious service or other enforced gathering, they are marvelous places to observe lenses and their users at close range.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2001, 16:35</p><p>To a pub tonight, one that's noted for the variety and quality of its beers - and there's a no-smoking room! At one table, three couples, lots of wedding rings. In the corner seat a tall, well-built guy; fresh complexion, close-cropped hair, casually but not smartly dressed, with *strong* plus lenses in gold wire frames. From my seat, eight or ten feet away, when he turned his head in the right direction I could see a clear inverted image of the wall behnd him; when I was looking sideways on all I could see from his lenses was internal reflections. Quite friendly too. Just before the party got up to go, one of the girls was obviously having contact lens trouble, and I think she walked out with her eyes closed. One of the others said while she was struggling, "You've got a nice pair of glasses; why don't you wear them?" </p><p>(Thinks: we'd all like to know the answer to that one!)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2001, 09:50</p><p>And now for something completely different. </p><p>At a Scottish dance function last night, I observed one good-looking young man with the greatest interest: tall and fair, hair already thin on top. Slim, but not too thin to wear the kilt. Kilt exactly the right length to show a decent pair of hairy knees. Fancy hand-knitted white hose. Beautiful dancer, as was his much smaller girlfriend; they were both enthusiastic and accurate, and that matters a lot in Scottish dancing. Minus lenses, not more than -2, in a modified oval frame (flattened off at the sides). The young lady wore round gunmetal wire frames; her lenses were also minus. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;29 Dec 2001, 09:43</p><p>Pip, you were asking... </p><p>I guess a low Rx in my book is -1 or less; I'd definitely say that guy's was below -1 in one eye and below +1 in the other. (that's the one I posted about on the 16th). </p><p>As for cylinder: if there's a lot of cylinder in a lens, observing it from a distance will show a distorted image rather than just a reduced or enlarged one; in extreme cases you'll see not 'power rings in a minus lens but 'powere ars' diametrically opposite each other.  </p><p>When there's more cylinder than either + or - sphere, the lens can look like a plus at one distance and a minus at another. In the particular case of the youth in the checkout line, looking through his lens from behind showed an image that moved up and down as I moved my head, but not side to said at all. </p><p>Hope that helps; if you thnink my conduct is bizarre there are folks here who do that sort of thing all the time! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pip</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2001, 14:38</p><p>and finally, how can you tell if someone's prescription has cylinder? Thanks!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Pip</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2001, 14:37</p><p>Julian, what do you classify as low RX in your jotting of `16 December?  Curious to know what you consider low?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;26 Dec 2001, 09:11</p><p>At a funeral last week (I have to attend quite a lot of funerals and the undertakers and their staffs get quite familiar) I noticed a tall thin bearer I hadn't seen before. Quite young, not madly attractive, but a healthy head of fair hair. At the cemetery he got out of the limusine he was driving - wearing glasses, which he kept on from then onwards: brown wire frames not unlike mine, plus lenses with a fair bit of cylinder - again not unlike mine, but more plus sphere and more cylinder. And not varifocal as mine are. Quite made my day. </p><p>The previous day in a check-out queue, a young guy with short black hair and squarish black frames. Lenses, as far as I could see, plus cylinder and nothing else. (Good week for cylinders?) </p><p>Another day at another gathering, big youth with clear complexion and oval frames in gold wire with plus lenses, not very strong. I had a notion they were photochromic - and at one point he took them off and put them on the table in front of him while he talked to his neighbour. </p><p>Oh yes, and the nice young man I mentioned in my last post was wearing his specs again at Christmas morning Mass, and I was right: his right lens is strong enought to enlarge that eye but the left is a weakish minus...much as I dislike contacts, he probably has as good reason to wear them as anybody. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2001, 09:52</p><p>I've been travelling up and down the country a lot recently, and when I have spotted sexy spexy guys I haven't had time to jot about them. Yes, I have to confess: Jules has been spotting and not jotting ::(  </p><p>One or two worth mentioning though: </p><p>The other week I came across a guy I've known a few years - dark hair, sweet smile, dimples - who has always worn preppy round glasses. NOW he's in heavy golden-brown plastic frames and much more obviously strong lenses than before: plano fronts and lots of minification and power rings. More obvious, maybe because the new specs are so much bigger than the old ones.  </p><p>Then I got into conversation with the most spectacularly handsome young man; I've seen him around before but we've never spoken. Slightly Jewish appearance though I don't know: big nose, full lips, dark brown eyes full head of black (or maybe very dark brown) hair and a short beard, not much more than designer stubble. Gold wire frames, medium size, with photochromic lenses that gave his eyes an air of mystery. Low Rx, so that I wondered why he was wearing them fulltime, but I think one lens was low plus and the other low minus, which many people would find awkward. He was very beautful. </p><p>Before I go on, I've just been out; the streets seem to be alive (I exaggerate, a little) with handsome young Pakistanis with beards and black wire framed glasses. </p><p>Going back quite a few weeks, to the time when the BBS was down...about a year ago I wrote about a smart young man who turned up at our church one Sunday morning and whom I had last seen as a scruffy teenager with a strong plus Rx. My surmise about contacts proved to be correct, he's been there regularly ever since and mentions his contacts. One Sunday a few weeks ago he appeared with his specs on (he was going for a medical exam and wasn't allowed to wear contacts for a week before) - squarish white metal frames, not specially fashionable but quite becoming. The right lens was certainly strong plus; I never managed to get a proper look at the other one but had a notion it was low *minus*. In any case by the next week he was back in contacts. </p><p>Another sighting too from back around then, but it was a woman so I'll post it somewhere else - 'Sightings' maybe. </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2001, 13:22</p><p>Today, on the Tube, a handsome young guy with white-blond hair and high cheekbones; he could have been Swedish. He was tall and slim and dressed in black - a real stunner. But it was his glasses that made me gasp. Silver frames, faintly octagonal, with two of the thickest minus lenses I've seen for ages stuffed into them. His big, beautiful grey eyes were minimised and surrounded by a forest of white rings; severe cut-in, of course. I stood really close to him and admired the way both lenses jutted out at the back, one more than the other: despite hi-index, it was half an inch thick. The guy was in his early 20, so goodness knows what Rx he'll end up with, but I'd guess he's already -12/-14. I know I always say this, but he must be so totally helpless without them; I had wonderful vision of him bumping into stripped-pine Scandinavian furniture as he makes a bare-eyed trip to the bathroom. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2001, 02:16</p><p>It seems to be a gala day for black wire ovals. I've been to London for a meeting (and I'm typing this on my laptop while sitting on the floor in a ridiculously crowded train). </p><p>First thing this morning Stoke station seemed amazingly well supplied with short-sighted young men, nothing specially striking about most of them apart from their uniform taste in frames to put round their minus lenses - all black wire, all variations on the oval shape. Euston was the same, though I did spot a Jewish boy with quite strong minus lenses, rimless this time but still oval, and still black wire for the temples. </p><p>Boarding the tube (I think that was when I changed trains at Oxford Circus) there was a guy in front of me with fair hair, gold ovals, and plus lenses - which made a nice change - but he got off after one station. Also in the carriage was a big guy with short black hair, blue eyes, a high colour, and semi-rimless specs in mottled brown plastic, a style I haven't seen in decades (but the shape was modern) - the lenses were minus, I could see a bit of cut-in. Altogether a nice sight on a winter morning. Opposite him a black boy with close-cropped hair and black wire frames, round this time, and I think plus lenses. </p><p>As the day went on there were more and more of them...not quite oval but octagonal...rather more oblong..and once or twice those oblong semi-rimless ones that are so good on the right face. </p><p>NOW as I sit on the floor of this train there's a fair-haired girl squatting close by, reading - through black wire ovals, plus Rx. And just out of sight another guy, tall and slim, also working on a laptop. He has brown plastic semi-rimless, but not mottled, more of a laminated look. </p><p>(Written on Friday but not posted till saturday...I have a few more spottings to jot about when I get a minute)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2001, 04:26</p><p>In the pub (my local) last night, I was standing at the bar talking to the landlady and a few other people when a familiar voice said "Goodnight, all"; the landlady said "Goodnight, Steve" (Steve is a young guy, married before you get any ideas; he used to live close by and come in quite a lot but now lives a couple of miles away so we don't see so much of him.) I turned round to say goodnight, only to find that Steve was wearing glasses - lenses not strong, I'm guessing very low minus but couldn't really see; the frames were a disaster. Steve is, well, not fat but solidly built; squarish face, brown complexion with a high colour; black hair and brown eyes - and his small ovals in silver metal looked faintly ridiculous. Something oblong and black, either metal or plastic, would have worked wonders for him. Why don't people consult me before they choose their frames?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2001, 13:29</p><p>To Bristol and back by train yesterday. As always plenty to see, but the highlight was on the way home: the train before the one I expected to catch at Birmingham was delayed and I managed to get on. It was one of the sexy new 'Voyager' trains but it was choc-a-bloc till a lot of passengers (or customers as they insist on calling us these days) got off at Wolverhampton and I got a seat. Almost opposite was a young guy in a business suit, either staring into space or dozing, with a pair of black plastic framed glasses (modern style) in his hand, power rings clearly visible. As we approached Stafford I saw he had put them on and they looked stronger than I'd thought. At Stafford he got up to leave the train and as he passed I cudl see that the lenses were quite thick, standing out beyond the frames, at least on the outside edges but not, I thought, top and bottom. So there was quite a bit of cylinder there (or just possibly base-out prism)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2001, 13:37</p><p>In a clothing store today my attention was caught by the guy on customer services: tall and lean with short black hair, very tanned, bits of jewellery sticking out of the gristle of his ears, rings on various fingers, wearing a grey suit, white shirt. Oval rimless glasses with a plus Rx and maybe a bit of cylinder.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2001, 03:11</p><p>Visited a cash and carry warehouse yesterday. The queue for the checkout had just reached the point where they open another till, and a big fair guy beckoned us over. He was about 6'2" and well built, very fair skin, a mop of silky fair hair - and silvery-grey wire rimmed glasses, round, sitting down his nose a bit, Rx around -2 I suppose. Big hands with well-kept nails, and a very pleasant manner. Addressed me as "young sir" which is bizarre - a mannerism I guess. Anyway I've come all unnecessary at the thought of him. Might go shopping there again pretty soon ::)</p><p></p><hr>
