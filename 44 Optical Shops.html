<p><b>Rupert</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2014, 15:21</p><p>Hello Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Yes, I placed my order with Zenni and had no problems. The glasses are in transit and will be arriving in a few days. So, it all worked out fine. </p><p> </p><p>I think you're right that the message has always been there. I just didn't notice it when I placed my first order a couple of years ago. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks again for encouraging me to go ahead and order.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Nov 2014, 23:35</p><p>Rupert </p><p>I just wanted to report that I placed orders for glasses for 2 different people with Zenni. I have actual current prescriptions for both people but I at times have placed orders without a current up to date prescription. So I was curious if they would contact me asking for a copy of the prescriptions and they did not. Honestly i have seen that disclaimer many times through the years but never actually read it until you pointed it out. But it seems nothing has changed which I am happy about.  </p><p>So did you in fact go ahead with placing your order? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GreginColo</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2014, 19:57</p><p>Hi Trent; if I am recalling correctly, Zenni optical usually has a BOGO special for Black Friday, so I am hoping they plan to do so again this year, as I have been waiting to order, so we should know in a few weeks.  In the meantime you may want to go to their site and look at frames, etc in case they offer this special again.  I have been pleased with glasses I have ordered from them in the past. Hope this helps.  Thanks also for sharing your recent Rx, if the same Trent. Regards, Greg.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Trent</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2014, 19:23</p><p>With Black Friday and Cyber Monday coming, where do you think the best sale on glasses will be?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2014, 17:37</p><p>Crystal Veil </p><p>To be honest like yourself i have been placing orders with Zenni for about 11 years now and have probably ordered several hundred in those years and yes i saw statement but I don't recall ever reading it. i just finished checking my orders to be sure they were entered correct and simply clicked where it asks if you accept the terms and conditions. So has it in the past always ask for a written copy of your prescription slip to be included? I told Rupert the only way to find out is to place his order and if they don't accept it then we all have a problem. But otherwise he should receive his glasses as ordered. Most all of my orders do have actual prescriptions from the people wanting them. But I usually always order several pairs a month of glasses that I think will be popular with my clients based on their age group. So far this has worked out very well. Of course every so often some of them are dropped by Zenni. But because my sample pairs all have very weak prescriptions in them I don't have much trouble selling them at a slightly reduced price.  </p><p>Anyway until now have you ever read that statement at the very end? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2014, 16:20</p><p>Rupert, </p><p> </p><p>I have been ordering Zenni glasses for five years (well over a hundred pairs) and always simply fill in the form without adding a photocopy of an optician's prescription. They only ask me questions about orders for glasses with high prescriptions without high index. I then explain to them that the glasses are not for use in daily life, only for photo shoots with models (which happens to be the truth!) so nobody will ever complain about the thickness of the lenses. I hope this information is reassuring to you. All you have to think of is how to paraphrase it for your own situation. Good luck! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2014, 12:41</p><p>Rupert </p><p>Please do! Many of us in here use them quite often and that would be a major bad thing if they are only accepting written prescription slips. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rupert</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2014, 12:01</p><p>Thanks so much for the responses! </p><p> </p><p>I'm going to go ahead and order. If I run into any problems, I'll alert the crew here at Eye Scene!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2014, 11:58</p><p>Rupert </p><p> </p><p>I think your fine too place your order. Those terms have been in place for some time and I have never had a problem getting orders placed and received. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2014, 11:44</p><p>The last time that I ordered from Zenni was a few months ago. They did not ask for a prescription. They just had an online area where you fill in spghere, cylinder, axis, add. What I am wearing is a little higher than my real prescription, which is over three years old.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rupert</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2014, 11:07</p><p>Quick question about Zenni Optical. I was just about to order a couple of pairs of glasses to do GOC and noticed in the terms of sale as I was checking out that they are requesting that a copy of the prescription be sent via e-mail, fax, etc. along with the order. </p><p> </p><p>Since I'm doing GOC, my actual prescription does not match what I'm ordering. I ordered a couple of great, thick pairs from Zenni two years ago and had no problem. Does anyone know if they're actually following through on the prescription request? I canceled my order for now. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>aviator -00- </b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2014, 16:25</p><p>Does anyone here have experience or ordering glasses from optical shops in Argentina? Do they require an "official" prescription, or will piece of paper written by the customer be sufficient? Also, what are the prices like if buying in Buenos Airies? All advice welcome.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>19dollface76</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2014, 11:56</p><p>newbie -- while this doesn't help you just yet, it soon will.  Visio-Rx.com will soon be offering international shipping as it looks like more countries are being added to the website (US and Canada,but Netherlands and Spain are now showing up recently, which may mean shipping will soon be available!).  The wonderful thing about this is that they are the only website to have come up with software tools on their site to accurately measure vertical fitting height for bifocals/progressives(varifocals)/etc.  This is a critical measurement that allows for proper prescription/lens placement in the frames you choose and will make you a much happier customer.  I believe if you contact them, you can be notified when the shipping becomes available. </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419190831/http://www.visio-rx.com/contact-us" target="_blank">http://www.visio-rx.com/contact-us</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>newbie</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2014, 15:35</p><p>Thanks for your advice, Soundmanpt.  I will give that some thought.   As you say, the 50% cash back offer does reduce the risk.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2014, 11:55</p><p>Newbie </p><p>Maybe I can help you a bit for any future on line glasses shopping. Your correct that it is so much easier to buy some nice single vision glasses on line and not have any problem, but varifocals, progressives and bifocals is somewhat more of a challenge to get the correct sight height for the add.  </p><p>It's great that you prefer a rimless or semi rimless frame style or any frame that has the adjustable nose pads. This at least does allow for the glasses to be adjusted higher or lower and puts the add in the proper location. Also something that Zenni (zennioptical.com) has started asking when you place your order is where you position your glasses on your nose, pushed all the way up, part way down or low on your nose. Picking one of these should help them place the add closer to what works best for you. </p><p>As for a good fit of the glasses in general, something I have found that works very well is to first find a pair of your previous glasses that fit your face best. Measure them across the front from the outside left to the outside right in millimeters and then when shopping on line for new glasses find something that is very close to the size of your glasses that fits well.  </p><p>Doing these things should help at least  </p><p>If this still doesn't help and your not pleased with your new glasses Zenni will at least refund 50% of what you paid for them which isn't a bad deal considering they are not very expensive in the first place. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2014, 03:48</p><p>Everyone should check out Made Eyewear. They seem to only offer hipster frames for now sadly, but they will send you a free trial of 3 frames with PRESCRIPTION lenses for up to a week and it's up to you what you keep with FREE shipping. </p><p> </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419190831/http://www.madeeyewear.com/" target="_blank">http://www.madeeyewear.com/</a> </p><p> </p><p>They actually own the factories they use and apparently manufacture them with qualtiy and for $5 or less a pair so beat Warby Parker at their own game</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>newbie</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2014, 19:41</p><p>In my last post (last line) I think I meant too say 'too low in the frame'.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>newbie</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2014, 19:39</p><p>Does anyone here have a view on which UK chain opticians give best value?  I have seen a number of contributors say that independents give better value than chains but I don't know whether they mean US or UK.  In my area the independents seem to be aiming at the high end of the market and are therefore very expensive. </p><p>I'm looking for varifocal lenses in rimless or semi-rimless frames (ie not the current fashion) and the local independents are quoting £400-£500.  I did buy a semi-rimless pair online few years ago and while they fitted reasonably well, in the end I didn't feel I suited the frame and the add in the prescription started too high up the frame, so that I had to tilt my head up to read.  I could, I suppose, buy online again, on a trial and error basis, accepting that although it may take a few tries to get a really suitable pair, I would still have spent less than I would buying on the 'high street'. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus jack</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2013, 00:23</p><p>Astra, </p><p>You might want to explain coherent and non-coherent light and the sources and uses. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Astra</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2013, 00:13</p><p>As for the unit of "angular deflection", </p><p> </p><p>Scientific prisms are often used for deflecting a coherent beam of light ray to propagate in a specific direction.  </p><p> </p><p>This purpose is different from Ophthalmic prisms or most types of non-prismatic lenses, which often comes with the unit of "focal length", are often used for focusing of non-coherent light beams.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2013, 12:39</p><p>Aubrac, </p><p>Ophthalmic Prisms are prescribed in Prism Diopters defined by Sir Isaac Newton 300 years ago as: 1 Prism Diopter is that amount of prism that will deflect a ray of light 1 cm at a distance of 1 meter.  Some times you see it written as a number with a small superscript delta or triangle symbol followed by the direction of the Base of the prism Up, Down, In or Out. The delta or triangle is often mistaken for the small superscript circle denoting degrees of several different types. </p><p>Scientific prisms are often specified in angular degrees of deflection.  When Newton was defining, distances were more easily measured very accurately than angular degrees. </p><p>There is a trigonometric relationship between Prism Diopters and angular degrees using an Arctangent function (Inverse of the Tangent function).  It turns out that 1 Prism Diopter = approximately 0.57 angular degrees. </p><p>The simple, but surprisingly accurate prism test I outlined on the Vision and Soex site uses Newton's definition of Prism Diopters. </p><p>Even if you use a small circle to designate Prism Diopters, most lens makes will interpret that as being Prism Diopters and make the glasses </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2013, 06:25</p><p>Aubrac, </p><p> </p><p>Zenni recently started offering prism glasses at a modest extra cost, just under 10 dollars. You may well get what you want there.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2013, 05:31</p><p>Was interested in getting some glasses made up with base out prism added. Unfortunately the cheapest seller, SelectSpecs, insists on a prescription for prism correction. </p><p> </p><p>However Glasses4eyes does prism up to 3 degrees, and when I called them said that for £10(UK pounds) per lens, they would do higher levels so might give them a try.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>aviator -00-</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2013, 18:12</p><p>Does anyone have experience of buying glasses in Brazil? Will they insist on a proper prescription, or do the optical stores accept what the customer asks for?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2013, 11:03</p><p>If you're ever in Vegas, go to the Cosmopolitan hotel/casino, take the escalator to the 2d floor and there's a shop called RetroSpecs which is way cool.  It's an interesting mix of original old frames, some of which have been rx'd and some of which haven't, but all in excellent shape and can be rx'd.  Also, they have brand new frames made to be vintage.  You'll find just about anything you want, they have 3 licensed professional opticians on staff, but are very upscale in price.  Their GM is a sweetheart, she came to them from other retailers, and unfortunately has no correction herself.  But, she wears a pair of black/silver Clubman style frames, plano with AR coating.  Well worth the trip.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stingray</b>&nbsp;26 Apr 2013, 10:18</p><p>I just ordered a new pair of glasses from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419190831/http://www.greateyeglasses.com/shop/home.php" target="_blank">http://www.greateyeglasses.com/shop/home.php</a>  They have powers up to -/+ 20.00  and the prices are dirt cheap</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;26 Apr 2013, 08:38</p><p>Ellie, </p><p> </p><p>a good alternative for 1.74 lenses in a Zenni frame is ciliaryblue. My life partner Nel has -12 and needs progressive lenses. Zenni does not go higher than -10.00 for progressives. So I sent two of her favorite Zenni frames to ciliaryblue and they charged me 200 GBP for each pair. The glasses look great and give her perfect vision. If you only need single lenses (presumably the case) their price is 95 GBP per pair. Not as cheap as Zenni would have been but still only one third of what your local optician charges you. It's really worth a try!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ellie</b>&nbsp;26 Apr 2013, 00:23</p><p> I had the opportunity to speak with a Zenni representative on their live chat today and I asked about the 1.74 high index lenses. It turns out that they are an option to only -10 and below...which I found strange. Perhaps they're getting lens shipments from a different source than they used to in the past? I'm not sure. The representative said she didn't know if 1.74 lenses will be made available to those with higher precriptions (like me).  </p><p> </p><p>I'm quite disappointed as I was hoping to get a really nice (and inexpensive) pair. My current glasses from Zenni broke unfortunately, so I need to get a new pair anyway. I'm suffering with having to wear contacts for longer than I am used to...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Apr 2013, 11:34</p><p>Specs4ever </p><p> </p><p>I had forgotten about that happening to you, and I know they have a disclaimer that says some prescriptions, I assume stronger ones, may take a bit longer than 14 days to deliver, but without a doubt 4 weeks is excessive. I can certainly understand your displeasure with them for that as I am sure your daughter was in need of her glasses. So as a consumer with other options available that are good and maybe more timely I get it. If I ever feel that I am getting poor service I would be doing the same as you.   </p><p> </p><p>One thing I can tell you is that I now know of many opticians and even the doctors that are getting their own glasses as well as their family members from Zenni and in many cases they have told me that Zenni is more accurate with their prescriptions then their own lab is. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;13 Apr 2013, 23:06</p><p>If you go back to 05 May 2011 @ 09:18 and read to 12 May 2011 07:57 in the thread Online Retailers it might refresh your memory soundmanpt.  The eventual outcome was that they did not get her glasses to me on time and they refused to refund my money. The eventual outcome was that they did ship the glasses directly to her, but she had purchased another pair from a local optical store. </p><p>When I get ticked off I have a a long memory and the fact that they were very uncooperative didn't  help.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Apr 2013, 15:52</p><p>Specs2ever </p><p> </p><p>Just curious what problem did you have with Zenni as I have used them for many years and ordered many hundreds of glasses from them without even one problem. (so far) As well as other members of our vision group. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;13 Apr 2013, 06:52</p><p>Ellie, I have been sadly disappointed with Zenni during my past couple of purchases.  I have found www.choiceeyewear.com to be a decent alternate, and they do offer 1.74 lenses</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ellie</b>&nbsp;13 Apr 2013, 00:53</p><p>Hello Soundmanpt, thanks for your response. Please let me know if you are able to reach someone at Zenni who can explain what happened to the lens selection.  </p><p>I'm quite disappointed that they don't offer higher index than 1.67 anymore. I wonder if they would do special orders. I was hoping to get a new pair as I'm heading off to college this fall and am contemplating wearing my glasses in public more often. Especially since I can't find contacts that correct me properly, I will need to wear glasses more often. My prescription is -14.50 for my right eye and -12.50 for my left. I also have moderate astigmatism in my left eye as well, which makes it hard for me to find toric lenses that go up in my power for sphere. I don't think my glasses would look bad in the 1.67 (I have a pair with 1.67 in an older rx) but I would prefer a nicer looking pair.  </p><p> </p><p>Also, sorry for posting in the wrong thread. I forgot that there is a thread called Online Retailers.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Apr 2013, 10:48</p><p>Ellie </p><p> </p><p>You are correct. Interesting that they don't offer it anymore. I will make a point to ask them the question next time I chat with them. Actually you can do the same as they have a nice "live chat" that they answer questions on. I did notice that it wasn't real cheap as I recall it was an additional $78.00 or so, but compared to the optical stores still a bargain. Does your prescription warrant such a hi index? I have ordered glasses from them in the teens with just the 1.67 lenses and they look great.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ellie</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2013, 21:07</p><p>Not sure if I'm just not looking in the right place, but does Zenni still offer 1.74 high index lenses? Every time I get the screen to order my glasses I only see the 1.67 as the highest index. Is this happening to anyone else?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2013, 10:38</p><p>Crystal Veil </p><p> </p><p> That should work for them in the future. Most all optical shops respect and honor a request for a patient's prescription without question.  </p><p> </p><p>I was wondering why you didn't just use your trial frame and lens on them as that should work well. Now I understand why. </p><p>You should be able with their own help to get reasonably close to their prescriptions by their first picking out the glasses they want to use in the shoot and then modeling with them.  </p><p> </p><p>looking forward to your next shoot. Sounds like you have quite a good number of willing models to select from.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2013, 05:32</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>I will mention your information to the models. It's not the end of the world if they don't know their exact prescription. It often happens that a model puts on a pair of vintage glasses, exclaiming, "I can see perfect through these!". Then I know their actual prescription. There will be no room left to bring along a trial frame + trial lens set to Ireland so the glasses will have to do the trick. </p><p>Thanks for your information, much appreciated! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2013, 09:32</p><p>Crystal Veil </p><p> </p><p>That is a shame that that won't release the girls prescriptions to them. I can only wonder if their prescriptions are more than a year old? It is common now that optical shops won't provide a patients prescription if it is past a year. But if it current there should be no reason to refuse providing it. One possible way to maybe get their prescriptions would be if you have a friend that is an eye doctor or even an optician that would call their doctor and ask for it. Usually doctors will provide it without question to another doctor.  </p><p>Then of course yo should recommend to these models that they find doctors that will provide them a copy of their prescriptions in the future. They need only ask when they are making their appointment if they can have a copy of their prescription?  </p><p>We of course don't want to see you limited to the models that you want to us in your photo shoots because of this. </p><p>I know you often pay the models by having them pick glasses for themselves from Zenni when the shoot is completed and of course you need their prescription in order to do this. </p><p>I think we all enjoy the fact that you always provide what the models own prescription is which adds to the effect of how well the models can see with the various glasses they are modeling.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2013, 04:18</p><p>I am not quite sure if this is the right thread. Just a deep sigh (not with relief) after receiving several messages from models in Ireland. Their opticians simply refuse to give them the prescription of their latest glasses. A real nuisance as I'm in the process of selecting glasses for their photo shoots next week. It's all about money and self protection as far as the shops are concerned. The good thing is that my schedule for the photo shoots is already full and there is a nice variety of models who reacted on my casting call. If there are no "Irish promises" made I have three hectic days in the Dublin area :).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2013, 11:27</p><p>Maybe I am crazy for doing this, but I did write SGS back and told him that I had no interest in him shipping me my third pair of glasses.  Lets face it, I won't deal with him again and I have told him so. </p><p>I did also tell  him that I would not post any more negative things about the experience I had with him. This is not negative, but is an update.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2013, 15:45</p><p>I wonder why SGS uses as you say such cheap and poor quality frames. It sounds like his lenses are great and very reasonable in price. Maybe if he has trouble getting decent frames he should consider buying just the frames from Zenni as they can be bought without lenses for $3.00 and up. But many are under $8.00.  </p><p>From what I have read in here it seems like SGS's biggest problem is being inconsistent with his orders and delivering them in a prompt manner? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2013, 13:56</p><p>Hi revolver:  Yes, I had considered that thought.  But I did post some pretty negative things about him on Alibaba as well as here.  So I am wondering why he is "trying to make things right". It is sort of like shutting the barn door after the animals have escaped if you follow my logic. </p><p>On the other hand, if he is sincere then possibly I have misjudged things and I might have jumped the gun with my negative postings.   </p><p>I will keep everyone posted if there are further developments.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2013, 13:21</p><p>Specs4, my two cents worth. I think you should answer the e-mail and get whatever you can. As you said it's not about the $35, on the other hand, he owes you a pair and you just as well have them. </p><p> </p><p>When they are in hand, you can make a decision as to whether to go any further with him.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2013, 06:15</p><p>specs4ever, </p><p> </p><p>sorry to hear about your recent bad experience with SGS. I have not bought anything from him for a while because the frames remain the same. He used to have some great frames in extreme prescriptions (e.g. Depai, Lin Wei, Tiaotiaotu and Feizai frames) and I still use these in my photo shoots. There is no way I could have bought these glasses for a modest price. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2013, 23:43</p><p>In defense of SGS likelenses he is the only reasonably priced supplier of high prescription glasses.

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2013, 04:17</p><p>I would disagree strongly with that video.  </p><p> </p><p>For the price of anywhere between 5-10 pairs (or maybe more with extra coatings) of designer glasses from a high street optician you can try more than enough styles, and instead of trying even if things don't work out you still have spare pairs. Buy one designer pair, it breaks or you lose it you are done.  </p><p> </p><p>Glasses, like US health care just cost way too much and while there is value added by designers it is overpriced. The Chinese are all over this, while there is a craft in the design and material choices etc it is not worth the designer markup value amount. If you can manufacture you can experiment with design. Look at firmoo.com's community site, they have copied but there's also some very interesting arm styles etc from the no name brands that the luxottica designers have not come up with  </p><p> </p><p>Ive still occasionally tried the regular stores, and their value add is terrible. Many frame stylists are just choosing frames for people at random, arent aware of principles like eye shape, face type etc. The only value the store adds is the ability to try frames on to get a feel for the weight, fit, shape, feel of the frame etc and that's entirely independent of the staff. The online lens quality has gotten really good as well, lenses Ive gotten from Zenni and Coastal can be so clear I forget I'm wearing anything at all. Admittedly I no longer know what the state of the art is with Crizal etc is but for the knowledgeable buyers, the days of the high street optician are numbered imo </p><p> </p><p>We can print our own frames with 3D printers these days. They are not a substitute for even the online frames you can buy but the technology will only get better so who knows in the future. </p><p></p><hr>

The main purpose for that lens is for someone with a very weak prescription and they want a drill mount style pair of glasses. this makes the lenses thick enough to drill and yet keep the lens from being too weak and breaking. That lens option goes up to -8.00. But I doubt that would make your -5.00 lenses as thick as your hoping.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2013, 10:17</p><p>LeVisiteur </p><p> </p><p>I think one of the best out there is Zenni Optical (zennioptical.com)They do ship worldwide, there prices are very inexpensive, as low as $6.95 and the quality is really very good. they offer glasses up to -20.00 and they don't require a real prescription. So you can order whatever prescription you desire to wear without any question. They recently now offer prism glasses as well.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2012, 18:24</p><p>Clare </p><p>It seems you are getting better attention to your vision needs anyway. You had not mentioned that you had been told to only wear one contact before this. That of course doesn't sound like the correct solution to your problem because if one eye is dry no doubt the other eye isn't much better.  </p><p>Since there isn't much profit to be made in selling contact lenses I don't think they would mind at all if you only got your prescription and purchased your contacts from another outlet. But of course that is up to you. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2012, 14:18</p><p>This weekend I went to an independent optician for the very first time and was very happy with the service - even though they told me things I didn't want to hear! For years I have been to one of the UK's large chains and when I called them to say I was experiencing a lot of contact lens discomfort they said they could offer me a weekend appointment in a month. I thought I'd try a different large chain that's right outside my office but found them equally casual, although they could do me an appointment within a couple of days. That said my experience at the large chain is that I've rarely seen the same optician twice. </p><p>At the independent optician on Saturday I really noticed the difference - the optician spent a lot more time, discussed and showed empathy. The eye with the dry patch has been uncomfortable for a long time, the previous optician had suggested wearing just one lens which I tried and felt like I had double vision. I told the new optician this and she said that the difference between corrected and uncorrected a -3 would be too much. My November appointment will be with the same person who saw me on Saturday. Its no more expensive, although their contacts lens programme is, but even if it were I think it would be worth it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;03 Sep 2012, 02:08</p><p>Chex: my experience (also in the UK) is that while independents can be more expensive. this is not always the case. Some years ago I knew an optical technician who worked for a small chain but also did some work on the side for friends. His wife was a receptions for an independent, and he said he didn't understand how they made any profit.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chex</b>&nbsp;03 Sep 2012, 00:33</p><p>I am in the UK and have been using a major chain for many years. I've tried to get an appointment and was told I'd have to wait for three weeks so thought I'd see if I can get one earlier. I know there are a number of owner managed businesses in my area so presumed that they would be running the testing side too. I always feel the major chain is in a rush, never see the same person and wondered if I should try a more professional outfit?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Sep 2012, 13:46</p><p>Chex </p><p>Something most people don't know is that most doctors at least here in the states often work for more than one company. I have several good friends that are doctors and they all at least 2 jobs. Many optical shops only have a doctor for 2 or 3 days a week so for a doctor to make any decent money they work at another optical shop to make ends meet and quite often one is a chain and the other an independent shop. You are correct because if they work at say Wal-Mart an exam maybe around $50.00, but the next day they may be at an independent shop and they will charge $85.00.  </p><p>Hope that helped.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chex</b>&nbsp;02 Sep 2012, 11:15</p><p>does anyone have a view on the benefit of going to an independent eye doctor over a chain? I'm about to make an appointment and would like to know whether the indy is worth it, given it would cost more.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Apr 2012, 14:00</p><p>Clare </p><p>The strange thing is that most all of the on-line retailers glasses come from Hong Kong. Zenni is a great example which is very hard to figure since their home office is in the states and so really they operate as a middle man and yet their glasses are as cheap as $6.95 for a complete pair. But many like yourself say that glasses are not anywhere near that cheap in China. You would think buying direct would be much cheaper.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;17 Apr 2012, 13:27</p><p>Astra - I didn't find that glasses were cheaper than in the UK when I shopped in Hong Kong last year.

As you're aware SGS does offer women's glasses in the script I like but I'm not interested in his frame choices.  I don't like the combination of big frames and myodisc lenses and his smaller frame choices are rather ho-hum. </p><p> </p><p>Zenni on the other hand provides an OK variety along with superlative service.  I do (actually 'did'- past tense)  have a number of Zenni glasses and have been pleased with the style selections, in general, but I'm really seeking the look of those thick lenses in a superlative frame that - not the 10 to $40 variety.  Look at it this way, if you had been wearing strong glasses all your life wouldn't you want to look the best you can?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2012, 13:18</p><p>guests </p><p>I think you are correct in your concern about your frame for some reason getting lost. I have read where that has happened. Is there reason you are wanting to fit lenses into this frame and not just getting a complete pair made up?  </p><p>I am somewhat confused? Are theses glasses to worn by you or by a woman? Are you female or male then? I ask this because most of what SGC has shown in here have been womens frames.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>guests</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2012, 13:08</p><p>Thanks for the good feedback. </p><p> </p><p>I have dealt with Zenni before and have been very pleased with the results.  I've toyed with the idea of connecting with SGS; sending him a pair of frames and having his lens fitter put in a high script - even to -30!  I guess I'm concerned not just from a time consideration but that these special frames might get lost in transit or that they may be damaged.  (there's always a degree of risk with chasing a dream).  The strength of lenses he can provide is very appealing though. </p><p> </p><p>Cactus Jack:  My interest is not in the wearing of these glasses but just a fascination for glasses with strong minus lenses alone, or worn by women. </p><p> </p><p>What I will probably do is order some pairs with -20 rx from Zenni (3 prs for the price of two) and try my hand in grinding the lenses from one pair to fit my special frames.  I'm quite handy and skilled with tools but not yet clear about grinding, edge treating and fitting plastic lenses to have them appear professional. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks again.  All thoughts are most welcome!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2012, 10:57</p><p>Melyssa </p><p>Because I go to so many optical stores to pick up the donated glasses I am good friends with many of the opticians that work in the stores. I have told all of them about Zenni in conversations and now many of them go there for themselves as well as their families and friends. Needless to say one of the first things they do when their glasses arrive is to check them to be sure that the glasses were made correctly. Many of them have told me that they are surprised that Zenni was more accurate than their own lab in making their glasses. When glasses are made there is a certain tolerance that is allowed to be off, but Zenni is usually dead on or very close.  </p><p>I have no doubts with Zenni being very accurate in making single vision glasses as the only number that needs to be good besides the rx is the PD. But surprising I have taken a good number of orders for progressives and so far not had any rejects. Somehow the sight height seems to be fine.    </p><p></p><hr>

These markets contain products that are mainly imported from the Chinese mainland, and are available in the unorganised market at very low prices ranging from US$2 to US$10. These are mainly ophthalmic spectacles with refractive power and usually feature low-quality plastic lenses. A lot of non-branded sunglasses are also available in this segment. </p><p> </p><p>The organised players do not expect this to hurt their market shares, as these are non-standard goods.

The country also has the highest number of cataract patients. There are many children suffering from blindness and all that they need is glasses. Lack of awareness on eye disorders and shortage of ophthalamologists are the major reasons for the present scenario since there is only one ophthalamologist for almost a million Indians. </p><p> </p><p>Speaking on the under-developed Indian optical industry, Dr Holden feels that a lot more needs to be done for it to transform from the current $3 million industry to a $ 30 million industry. "50 million pairs of spectacles are imported from China each year and billions of dollars worth optical equipment are bought in from overseas.

There is an overall trend towards westernisation influenced by the availability of international products and spurred by satellite television. With growing consumer awareness about global fashion brands, coupled with rapidly growing income levels, the Indian consumers demand for high quality premium branded products has increased. The marketability of fashion accessories is becoming increasingly noticeable. As consumers need for fashion accessories become more and more individualised, the market is changing towards a large number of different products &amp; towards a short product cycle. </p><p> </p><p>In the eyewear industry, it is estimated that 35 per cent of Indias population, i.e. approximately 350 million people, are in need of vision correction, which may be done by surgery, laser therapy, spectacles or contact lenses. However, only about 25% of people have their vision corrected. </p><p> </p><p>In India, eyewear is at the forefront compared to the global markets where vision care has a strong presence. A near stagnant market has been converted into one of the fastest growing industries recording a 20% growth annually. Nevertheless, in global terms the industry in India remains underdeveloped even today. The Indian markets account for about 1% of the worlds consumption. </p><p> </p><p>Spectacles and sunglasses are used by over 1/3rd of Indias population &amp; a wide range is available to cater to the variety of the consumers. With the increase in the level of the self-awareness among the consumers, the emphasis is more on the look of the glasses and the image the customer seeks to create. There has been a noticeable shift in consumer purchases for eyewear from form and function to form and fashion. </p><p> </p><p>In past few years, the awareness of consumer towards branded eyewear products and eye care have been increasing and people are ready to spend on premium brands. In fact sunglasses are now being looked at, more as a fashion device rather than a protective device with the entry of international brands like Ray Ban, Benetton, Gucci, Police etc. </p><p> </p><p>The sunglasses and spectacle frames business in India has great potential with only a few organised players like Luxott-ica (with their Ray-Ban products), Safilo and Colorsoft. New entrants also getting into the fray and some of the old distributors, who operated throu-gh the grey market, are now also getting more organised in their approach and dealings.

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2012, 13:17</p><p>O.K., there was discussion on Seen On The Web about the cost of eyewear at optical shops vis a vis online companies and Asian countries.  Soundman correctly raised the point that ECP's are well aware of it.  And it is of great concern and there is getting to be a bunch of push back, or at least as much as can be done under the law. </p><p> </p><p>About 6 months ago, a highly respected nationally known ECP who writes a monthly article in one of the 3 major monthly optical publications wrote an article on this very topic.  The ECP is a clever writer and the piece was entertaining enough but did contain some vitriol.  Will try to paraphrase some of the key points below. </p><p> </p><p>The article was entitled "Price List for ECP Service, and at the very start in bold letters as if on a poster said "$35.00 to take a PD, $50.00 to select a frame, $50.00 to verify an RX, $65.00 to adjust a frame".  Starts off by an ECP assisting someone who comes into the store, shows lots of frames, and at the end the person just says he's only shopping and asks the ECP to write everything down and give him the PD. </p><p> </p><p>Here's a direct quote from the article, that when the person asks for a PD it's like saying "Zenni Optical is my optician, Sucka". </p><p> </p><p>The article then discusses if you have a price list how many customers you would lose, and cites a Consumer Reports article telling people to shop around for all things and then buy online.  And of course, the ECP cites overhead to run a brick and mortar store such as maintaining a paid for inventory, wages for employees, taxes, insurance, heat, and other utilities. </p><p> </p><p>This isn't the first or only article raising these issues, but was very eyecatching because of the skill of the writer.  Again, Soundman, of course ECP's are aware of the online situation and are fighting it however they can because it is their bread and butter and their investment is seriously threatened.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2010, 06:09</p><p>Helen, </p><p>Astigmatism correction, if it is not exactly what you need, can make a big difference in the wearability of a prescription because there is no possible way for you to compensate for it.  You can compensate for glasses that have a little too much minus in sphere, but that ability depends on how flexible your crystaline lenses are and the strength of your ciliary muscles.  Flexibility of your crystaline lenses is determined by your genes and your age. </p><p>I often suggest -1 or even -2 over as a starting place for over correction in late teens and 20s, but for people approaching 40, I suggest a less aggressive approach until their ciliary muscles get conditioned to being slightly over corrected.  That is why I suggested starting at -0.25 over. </p><p>The only way to find out if you can deal with being over corrected is to actually try it for a week or so in a real world visual environment.  That is why I suggested ordering some very inexpensive (about US$7.00 plus shipping) glasses with -0.25 sphere over from Zenni to see if you can manage it before having your existing frames reglazed with a higher Rx that you would have difficulty wearing.  You might be able to go a little higher, but the potential for having reading problems increases with the additional minus. </p><p>As we get older, dealing with being over corrected becomes more of an experiment than a certainty so we have to approach it slowly and carefully. </p><p>One thing I do need to assist further is your complete, most recent Rx. </p><p>C.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Helen</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2010, 04:56</p><p>Thanks EyeTri and Cactus Jack </p><p>Over the weekend I got to try a friend's prescription she says she is -0.50 higher than me with -.50 of astigmatism.

<p><b>EyeTri</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2010, 18:23</p><p>Helen, </p><p>In answer to your question about getting a frame reglazed, I have had good results from www.eyeglasslensdirect.com and www.lensesrx.com</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2010, 17:25</p><p>Helen, </p><p>You might be able to tolerate a slightly stronger distance Rx, say -0.25 or maybe -0.50 more.  However, it will not be too long until you will need a reading add unless you read with your glasses off.  If you have your complete Rx, you can experiment at low cost by ordering what ever Rx you want from an on line retailer such as Zenni. </p><p>Wearing a slightly stronger Rx will not have any significant long term effect at your age and if you can tolerate the over correction it may help keep your ciliary muscles in condition.  It depends very much on your available accommodation range. </p><p>If you want to try some a little stronger, I would try -0.25 over on the sphere.  Do not change the cylinder or axis.  If you need help measuring your PD, let us know. </p><p>If you tolerate the -0.25 increase, after a month or so, you might try -0.50.  If you use the same frame style for both, no one will be the wiser. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Helen</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2010, 16:17</p><p>Thank you Cactus Jack. </p><p>I would like a slightly stronger prescription but my prescription has been stable for a number of years. My husband wears -2.75 and -3 fulltime but his glasses are a little too strong for me. At 48 I realise most people are getting reading glasses not distance glasses! Is there anything to gain by persevering with something currently too strong in the hope that my eyes will accept it after a while?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2010, 15:33</p><p>Helen, </p><p>Vision is an incredibly personal thing and no has the right to tell any other person that his uncorrected vision does not deserve to be corrected.  It is in some ways like telling someone that they should not bother with shoes that fit comfortably because they are only a little too small or telling someone that their favorite dish should not be eaten because they don't happen to like it. </p><p>Seriousness, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder.  -1.50 means that anything beyond 66 cm or 26 inches is increasingly blurry.  I think the inability to see small text or objects beyond that distance is indeed serious.  Usually, it is people who wear higher Rx than the Rx in question think that the Rx is not "serious".  I personally think -0.25 is worth correction and -0.50 absolutely so.  -0.50 means that everything beyond 2 meters (6.5 feet) is increasingly blurry and vision in low light conditions is seriously compromised. </p><p>If you read some of the posts by people who got low Rx, first glasses, you will hear of their amazement at how crisp and vivid everything is.  I don't ever recall seeing any post where they wish they had not bothered unless extreme vanity was a factor. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2010, 13:39</p><p>Nick, </p><p>It is highly unlikely that 5 BO in each eye will cause any strabismus problems UNLESS you actually have some latent strabismus.  That amount is like reading at arms length.  It will increase the edge thickness. </p><p>Many people want thicker lenses because they are reluctant to wear glasses that look like they do not really need them. </p><p>Your current Rx is a "serious" Rx. Your sphere correction for you right eye means that you cannot see anything beyond 1 meter clearly and the cylinder correction means that nothing is really clear at any distance.  The sphere correction in your left eye means that nothing beyond 40 cm is clear and the small amount of cylinder makes that even worse. </p><p>Remember, no one knows what you see with or without your glasses but you.  You do not wear vision correction for other people, you wear it for your benefit. </p><p>Some people like being slightly overcorrected because of the super sharp vivid vision it provides. </p><p>I can not make any decision for you, you must do that. </p><p>Let me know how I can help. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

The glasses would be pretty heavy. </p><p>Another thing you could do is increase your sphere Rx by the same amount in each eye, but do not change the cylinder or axis.  At your age, you should be able to accommodate several diopters of increase, but I would start with -1.00 and get used to that before going higher. </p><p>Herer is your Rx with a -1.00 diopter increase.

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2010, 16:11</p><p>1, Glasses, </p><p>Base curve can affect edge thickness because the power in the lens is actually developed by the difference in the curve of the front of the lens and the curve of the back of the lens. Most low minus lenses have a + base curve in the front and a minus curve in the back and the Rx is the algebraic difference between the curves.  At low Rx it won't make all that much difference. </p><p>I was reluctant to suggest that he ask that the glasses be made from a very thick blank because they would be very heavy, but it would work.  As long as the curves are correct, it does not matter how thick the blank is to get the Rx right.  Some years ago, I think O4L made some glasses on special order that were something like -2.00 and about 15 or 20 mm thick. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>I, Glasses</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2010, 11:21</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>I thought I had read somewhere that the base curve of a lens could also affect its edge thickness.  Did I misunderstand that?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2010, 09:00</p><p>Nick, </p><p>Overall lens thickness is determined by two things, the Rx itself and the center thickness of the lens.  Optically, the material at the optical center of a minus lens only needs to thick enough to not break in normal handling, say 1 mm.  The edge thickness is then determined by the power of the lens and the size of the lens.  The higher the Rx and the bigger the lens, the thicker the edges.  The problem with such a lens it that it might be OK to wear, but would not protect your eyes from anything hitting the lens.  For example a rock might hit your glasses, break the lens, and damage your eye. </p><p>The solution is to make the center of the lens thicker which directly translates to the edge thickness.  If you make the center of the lens thicker by say 2 mm, the edge will also be 2 mm thicker. </p><p>There are a couple of ways to make your glasses thicker. </p><p>1. Request safety glasses.  They are automatically made thicker to protect your eyes. </p><p>2. Depending on your age, you might be able to deal with a small increase in the sphere portion of your prescription.  That will make the edge thicker. </p><p>3. Use frames with large lenses. </p><p>4. Consider adding 5 diopters of Base Out prism to each eye.  You should be able to handle that easily.  That will increase the outer edge of the lens by about 5 mm. </p><p>If you can tell us your age and complete Rx we may be able to offer specific suggestions. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;21 Sep 2010, 08:53</p><p>Hi Nick:  Here in the USA, the standard center thickness of a lens in a pair of prescription glasses is 2.2mm.  For years, a lens was available that was 3.2mm thick at the center, and these were called safety glasses.  With the advent of polycarbonate lenses I no longer know if there is a standard lens available with the increased center thickness, as polycarbonate lenses have been advertised as unbreakable.  You might be able to ask for the thicker center thickness, but unfortunately most of the labs that do lens grinding are pretty well set up to do standard things.  Good luck.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eye Tri</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2010, 15:28</p><p>Cactus Jack &amp; Katie </p><p>Zenni does charge for AR coating, but only $4.95. I've had good results from Zenni. I'm waiting for a pair of glasses from them now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2010, 08:06</p><p>Katie, </p><p>I believe an anti-reflective coating is included on Zenni's glasses.  I don't recall your Rx, but an AR coating may help with the internal reflections in the rimless glasses.  </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2010, 06:59</p><p>During the past six months I ordered some 40 pairs at Zenni's. I am doing a series of photo shoots with models wearing glasses from my "history" collection, more or less matching the model's own Rx. Near the end of each photo shoot I make portraits of the model in new Zenni glasses (Rx -8.00) bought especially for these photo shoots. If the model likes a certain Zenni frame from my collection, I order the same frame in her own Rx as payment for the model.  </p><p>So far, about a dozen Zenni glasses are used in daily life by my models and they are all quite happy with them. I also ordered a couple of Zenni glasses for myself and they are good quality.  </p><p>One model could not be helped in a satisfatory way because she needs multifocal lenses and her Rx is 1-2 diopters above -10.00 which is Zenni's upper limit for bifocal and multifocal lenses. I solved this problem by ordering a pair of Zenni glasses of 1.67 index (single view only) and adding a "Stick on Lens" to upgrade her glasses into bifocals. She has them only as backup in case something happens to her own multifocal glasses.  </p><p>I have nothing but praise for Zenni. They deliver the glasses within two weeks and so far, all the glasses are OK. The models and the Zenni glasses can be seen on my weblog "Ladies behind crystal veil" (nine models so far, some 300 glasses used, 1600 portraits).  </p><p>No guarantee, but I hope this information is of some use to you. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

I want to get a couple of pairs of new glasses which are not expensive and was going to order from zenni for the first time.

Are the zenni rimless well polished around the edges? Has anyone bought them with the standard 1.5 lenses or is it definitely worth upgrading to the 1.6 poly lenses?  </p><p> </p><p>Thanks! </p><p> </p><p>K</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>russell</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2010, 14:30</p><p>Julian:  I agree with you.  A private optician most probably takes more care in making lenses than a large chain does.  But I do know that in the US, unless a business posts in writing their policy that a certain service may not yield expected results, then they must stand behind shoddy work and make it good.  That's one reason we have small claims courts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2010, 10:26</p><p>Sydneycier, Russell: it seems to me that this is the sort of job that 'private' opticians do better than chains. That may just be my prejudice; but last year, or rather the year before, I bought a set of Adidas frames, wire ovals, very cheaply on eBay. When my test showed that no change was needed, I asked for them to be reglazed as a spare, and in a few days they came back fitted with Rodenstock progressive lenses. Though they're not 100% comfortable, they are serviceable, and I can see better with them than with my previous Rx.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>russell</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2010, 10:30</p><p>Did the people at SpecSavers give you a written policy that they are not responsible for lenses put in frames not bought at their store?  If not, then you may have a good small claims court case.  And if you mention that to the manager, he or she may replace your lenses free of charge.  Most business people don't want the hassle of going to court. (In the US, small claims court cases usually cost very little to file; I'm sure in other countries, there are similar options.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DWV</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2009, 00:30</p><p>Sears optical in Canada is advertising what is usually a real sale on glasses.  If it's the same deal as it was last year, it was cheaper than buying online for the same frames and lenses.

<p><b>DWV</b>&nbsp;15 Jan 2009, 00:40</p><p>I suspect they can't make progressive lenses with plano fronts, since the front surface is molded with the progressive part.

Also it only applies to sales that I "generate" on the actual day - if Mrs Jones wishes to come back the next day with her husband to choose her glasses I don't get my commission." </p><p> </p><p>I was intrigued by this and so did a bit of a search and came up with the following quotes: </p><p> </p><p>"I didn't wear glasses until today... As far as I was concerned I didn't need glasses..." (got prescribed at Specsavers) </p><p> </p><p>"I've made the comment that SpecSavers are money grabbing: alongside this story runs the equally unhappy story of my daughter's experience with them - we both had appointments at the same time. In her case, I had a very strong suspicion that they prescribed glasses she didn't need. That's another story, but I had the feeling they would do almost anything to secure a sale" </p><p> </p><p>"I know many people, especially students and others who are entitled to free health care, that have had theirs eyes checked at Specsavers Opticians. When I consider their experiences and mine I have noticed one particular thing, almost every single one has come out with glasses, some of which have never had them.  </p><p> </p><p>I have two friends in particular who have been given glasses, not knowing that that they need them, and later discovering after going to a different opticians, that they didn't need them at all!" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I know where I'm sending my wife for her next eye test!!! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hansel</b>&nbsp;12 Jun 2007, 14:15</p><p>Suggestions from the cognoscenti please! </p><p>Mrs Hansel gets an eye test from a mainstream optical chain, but gets the prescription filled elsewhere. </p><p>Lenses are varifocal. </p><p>Optician writes the script by reducing -0.50 to -0.25 in the leading eye so as not to alter the +1.25 add. </p><p>Mrs Hansel mow feels distance vision is compromised, she has always been precise in her liking for clarity, which the optician would have known. </p><p>Clearly at near £400 this is an expensive mistake. </p><p>Problem: the dispensing optician has filled the prescription she has given.

<p><b>capper</b>&nbsp;15 May 2007, 03:13</p><p>I have spent a fair amount of time in both China and Korea. It astounds me at how quickly and efficiently they make specs. A complete pair of quality prescription glasses can be ready for you in less than half an hour - and that includes the eye test!  </p><p> </p><p>The price of a pair of specs is less than the price of an eye test in the UK.  </p><p> </p><p>I know my way around, and also have chinese friends that know the best places to go, and how to bargain the frame sellers into submission - so granted i get them for tonnes less than your everage tourist and I also know good opticians that i can trust.  </p><p> </p><p>Last time i wet I bough 5 pairs of glasses (inc. 1 vary tint, 1 light tint and 1 full sunglass tint) and a new made to measure suit.

<p><b>DWV</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2007, 01:27</p><p>Leon: </p><p>About bevelled/faceted glasses, the best thing is to just ask; Eyeglass Factory Outlet seems like a good bet since they do a wide range of frames and lens styles.  Labs that do replacement lenses like Wohloptics or Opticallabdirect would also be a good bet, if you have a suitable rimless frame to use.  You could also try places that sell Shuron frames; Shuron still makes a big rimless droptemple frame that would be a natural for facets (if it doesn't come that way already). </p><p> </p><p>Gino: </p><p> </p><p>See my previous comments on Japan back in Janurary.  There was one glasses shop right outside the Akiba station; you can't miss it. </p><p> </p><p>If your wife isn't coming with you, you'd need her prescription, with the pupillary distance.  Or if you had a spare pair of her glasses, they could measure the prescription and PD from those.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glasseslover</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2007, 05:58</p><p>Hi Smudgeur </p><p> </p><p>I'm exactly in the same position: My wife wears her glasses a few times a year. She has a prescription very close to your wife's, nearly the same. The trouble is that she's still accomodating very well at 33 years of age. She does sometimes wear +1 readers for reading small print complaining she has trouble with tiny letters, but still can manage with efforts. When doing so her left eye goes a little inward and I do love that. But wearing glasses on daily basis...is still a dream and a fantasm for me... May be one day...If ever you have any way out to help a GWG lover mate....I'd be very grateful.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Leon</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2007, 04:32</p><p>In a couple of weeks I have about 7 hours to spend at JFK International Airport in NYC. Is it possible to do some glasses shopping there? (Lenses are a bit cheaper in the USA, compared to The Netherlands). </p><p> </p><p>Thanks!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Smudgeur</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2007, 13:38</p><p>My wife goes through bouts of threatening to not wear her glasses anymore as she "can see perfectly well without them". </p><p> </p><p>She wears them full time for me, but I'm not sure how much longer she will do this for (she's had them about 3-4 years now and so is well used to them" </p><p> </p><p>Her prescription is: </p><p> </p><p>r: +0.50 -0.50 080 </p><p>l: +0.75 -0.25 078 </p><p> </p><p>I have tried to explain to her about hyperopia and eyestrain etc. but I am fighting a losing battle as she still has enough accommodation (aged 39) to cope with such a small error. </p><p> </p><p>My question is this - my final throw of the dice before she discards the specs will be to get her to go for an eye test and get a professional opinion. Being involved in the medical profession herself I reckon she will agree to that. </p><p> </p><p>Do you consider that she is more likely to get prescribed glasses by a big chain of opticians (Dolland &amp; Aitchison, Specsavers etc) or at a small one-man-band? </p><p> </p><p>I am veering towards the latter as if I was a one-man-band optician I would prescribe for borderline patients (which my wife undoubtedly is) on the basis that I might get a purchase of glasses out of it too and so extra profits. Can't see that the chainstore opticians have got anything to gain - an incentive scheme would surely be unethical, wouldn't it? </p><p> </p><p>What are your thoughts to assist this slightly depressed OO?</p><p></p><hr>

The frames were really expensive (£125) but I really loved the shape and colour (red plastic) so saved up and bought them. When I went to collect them, they had stretched the frame beyond all recognition by forcing the wrong shape lenses in. I asked them to do them again, so they cut the lenses down and put them in new frames, but left a gap at one edge, cut one lens smaller than the other, and scratched one lens. I took them back again, and they reluctantly remade them with new lenses. I'm just waiting for them to fall to bits. Never again! :-(</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>aviator -oo-</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2006, 12:40</p><p>No 'useful contacts' to name - it is simply a matter of checking the optical outlets in the town or city you may be visiting in China (or wlesehwere in the world). Has anyone else here been to China?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>aviator -oo-</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2006, 06:30</p><p>(continued from previous posting) </p><p> </p><p>There is at least one manufacturer producing several styles of metal frames made with pre-fitted lenses. We are all used to this concept for reading glasses, but in China the same range is also available in minus values up to 6, in half diopter intervals. These cost around Y60 a pair (£4.30) and can be found in a variety of shops, not just opticians. In fact, many opticians do not put these glasses on prominent display, as I guess they make less money from them. The frame styles  of which there are about six  are available in gold or black, with graduated brown or grey tints, or none. They have the quality of mass-produced sunglasses and are not as well finished as custom-made glasses, but who can complain at that price!  </p><p> </p><p>My second discovery was more curious. All the opticians have a section devoted to rimless and semi-rimless frames. I was surprised to find a couple of outlets offering these with prescription lenses already fitted  often with light tints. Unlike the mass-produced ready-made glasses mentioned above, these were one-offs. The prescriptions were un-stated but in the range of 1 to 4. The opticians were quite happy to sell me on the basis that I had tried them on, and liked them. Despite language difficulties, there was no attempt to check that the prescription was right for me! I have a weakness for rimless glasses in colourful tints and found examples with pink, yellow and green tints. At around £8 per frame with lenses, I found it difficult not to buy up the entire stock! The wackiest pair I bought is a large oval-ish rimless style with a graduated tint starting purple at the top and ending green at the base! </p><p> </p><p>I have formed some theories as to why these glasses are on sale: one is that the frames were made for a specific customer who then failed to collect  this seems unlikely given that there was about 8-12 made-up frames in each of the stores I found.  A second theory is that these made to order by a customer who then found fault or changed his/her mind, forcing the original frames/lenses to be treated as damaged stock, to be sold off cheap. The only other theory is that these rimless frames are made up with prescription lenses on spec, to encourage customers to try them on in a prescripton close to their own. Has anyone else come across instances of this? </p><p> </p><p>Needless to say, I returned from China with several dozen extra frames for my collection.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>aviator -oo-</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2006, 06:30</p><p>Ive just returned from a trip to China. For those of us who collect frames with or without prescription lenses, the opportunities are considerable, and the costs can be a fraction of what you would expect to pay in the west. </p><p> </p><p>I found that the cities now have very smart optical shops which are almost indistinguishable from those in Europe or the USA. They have expensive designer frames, as well as cheaper ones, but these are not the places to find bargains. You need to go to the optical outlets in the smaller towns, or the more down market optical shops in the big citites. </p><p> </p><p>These are willing to fit prescription lenses to any frames you buy or provide yourself, to any value you state. They have glass lenses, CR39 as well as higher index types. They will try to persuade you to go for plastic lenses on the grounds of impact-resistance, and high index for a high prescription. The price of two CR39 lenses, fitted, is around Y80 (about £5.75p) although this can be negotiated down if you are ordering several pairs. </p><p> </p><p>The styles of frames on offer are similar to those in the west, although there is possibly a greater emphasis given to heavy plastic frames, with roughly rectangular windows which are wide but not very deep. These seem to be very popular with younger Chinese girls. Frame prices start from around Y60 (£4.30), although some of the high end designer models still cost as much as Y800 (£60).

<p><b>Stuart  </b>&nbsp;19 Sep 2005, 15:58</p><p>Patrick B </p><p> </p><p>Well the second pair arrived. I am more than satisfied with them. The lenses are exactly as ordered and the frames slightly darker than anticipated - but that is my fault in the ordering. </p><p> </p><p>It is great to have a pair of glasses for close work that look, feel and function effectively - not like the old "monsters".

Possibly also try the company that Brian mentioned in the last post. They are in Pakistan. </p><p> </p><p>Also look at the GOC thread on this  site and in recent postings you will find a link to a site where optical4less display some of their  special orders.

Luckily, no need for prism correction. </p><p> </p><p>The optical store which specializes in high prescriptions is actually called Optical4Less, not Optical 4 U, as Brian wrote in his recent post.  You should check out their website.  While they carry 1.9 lenses, I don't think they do bifocals in 1.9 unless, perhaps, it is a special order.  But do check them out.  They have a special order section as well. </p><p> </p><p>Good luck and let us know how you solve this problem.  I haven't got a bifocal choice with myodiscs and simply use a pair with a weaker prescription when I have to see up close for any length of time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;19 Sep 2005, 11:59</p><p>Danny -- The problem may be the +3.50 Add.  The highest normal add is +3.25 and that is probably the highest stock lens blank available.  +3.25 focuses at 31cm (12.2in) and a +3.50 would focus at 29cm or (11.4in) - hardly enough to make a difference.  Plastic bifocal lens blanks are moulded with the add in the front surface.  If you absolutely have to have a +3.50 bifocal in a very high minus lens you will probably have to have custom lenses made so hang on to your hat when you get the price. </p><p>Is there any strong reason they need to be +3.50 biocals. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Brian-16</b>&nbsp;19 Sep 2005, 11:07</p><p>Danny-Sounds like some of the chain optical shops in the USA.Try optical4u.com. It seems they can do almost any rx and tell them you want flat top bi-focals rather than the "progressives of varilux". Albert Poon or Fiona at optical4u.com will work with you.By the way what is vision level with your high rx?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Danny</b>&nbsp;19 Sep 2005, 10:09</p><p>I'm having trouble ordering a new pair of glasses in my prescription. </p><p> </p><p>My new numbers are: </p><p>Right -18.50 -1.50 095 8 base out +3.50 add </p><p>Left  -17.25 -1.00 090 8 base out +3.50 add </p><p> </p><p>I've spent almost an hour this afternoon sitting in an opticians store whilst they phone up the lens suppliers to see if I have have bifocals. </p><p> </p><p>The answer is no.

Indeed yes glasses can look very nice i like glasses very much if not over thick and heavy but is optical industry expoliting us?  People here like glasses but many other rather have good eyesight i fear but optical industry price glasses very high and also I believe glasses for myopic eye not help myopic progression.  I read of vision training and other technique which i believe help low myopic more than is stronger, stronger glasses many time.  Yes many like glasses include everyone here but some not and I fear for expolition with high eyeglass prices.   </p><p></p><hr>

People in urban areas generally replace their glasses every 3-4 years and in major cities people replace them about every 2-2.5 years. Due to the high demand for eyeglasses, the industry is highly profitable. Approximately 50 million pairs of glasses are sold each year including sunglasses, bifocals, and protective lenses.  </p><p> </p><p>Many consumers complain about the high cost of glasses. The actual cost of the lens is not even 10% of the cost that the glasses are sold for. While the cost of glasses is about 20 yuan ($2.41) they are sold for 200 yuan ($24.15). Salespersons average about a 50% profit for each pair sold. No wonder many people exclaim: glasses are money in my eyes!</p><p></p><hr>

I picked out one of my early frames (one I always liked), and a clip of the tint I like best, and toddled on down to the optician. I just asked them to put my current prescription in the old frame, and match the tint on the clip, and the whole thing was done in four days even though they had to send everything away to the lab. At first sight I thought the tint was more brown than grey, but that was just the impression gained by seeing the specs lying on the wooden counter at the shop. They were exactly the right tint I wanted. I think I'll always prefer to do specs business this way - face to face - in a shop setting.</p><p></p><hr>

Last time I had a test at Boots I was disappointed that they got my prescription wrong (said it was stronger than it needed to be) and tried to get me to carry on with the order for the glasses though I'd said I felt the prescription was wrong. And the optician admitted she was in a hurry, had another patient waiting. Not the greatest customer service.  </p><p>My mother went to a Specsavers where the staff were really helpful and we found a great pair of glasses (stylish and trendy). So nice she bought them in two colours - retired persons' discount too. They arranged to send them to her local store too. I might try them.

Last August, I went to Specsavers and was very pleased with the results. I got two pairs of spectacles; a designer FCUK pair and a pair of prescription sunspecs. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;05 Oct 2004, 13:32</p><p>I'm prepared to change my view on Specsavers based on recent experience. I went to a store with my mother and not only were the people there completely charming, they gave her the 'retired persons' discount despite it being a weekend, delivered the finished glasses to a store 250 miles away, and when they recognised they'd made a mistake in frame colour, were able to change it within 10'. The level of service and attitude belie a brand that appears to focus on price. Obviously value doesn't appear to impact service. A friend of mine using a London store had a good experience too. I'm thinking I might switch from Boots when my next exam is due in December - it's only convenience that keeps me going there.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SS</b>&nbsp;05 Oct 2004, 13:10</p><p>I had an eye test at Specsavers and have to say it was the most thorough I have ever had, and I came away with my first glasses.  I'm pleased even though they're -0.5 each eye!!  At least I got glasses. The choice of frames there is amazing, I came out with 3 different pairs, and spent a bit! Not as their name suggest</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;05 Oct 2004, 10:59</p><p>I emailed ZenniOptical, which is just up the road from me, but I never heard back from them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lurker</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2004, 23:51</p><p>This was supposed to to be 'a thread to discuss experiences with and post questions about brick and mortar optical retailers such as Lenscrafters, Specsavers, or the friendly optician around the corner' (Wurm, 1 May 2004) - so why are we discussing online suppliers here?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2004, 17:42</p><p>What about zenni optics? Any one have god luck bad luck with them?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>-14</b>&nbsp;05 Sep 2004, 09:00</p><p>I just read Laura's Aug 14 posting. I have purchased 2 pair of drilled rimless from Optical4less and found the quality to be excellent at an extremely competetive price and the service superb. I plan to make future purchases.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Smudgeur</b>&nbsp;15 Aug 2004, 01:25</p><p>I've ordered frames from Optical4less for both my wife and myself. They are good quality and a great price. Don't know what you're talking about Laura.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JJ</b>&nbsp;14 Aug 2004, 20:37</p><p>I purchased two pair of eyeglasses from Optical4less and found them to be the same quality as the $500.00 rimless eyeglasses I purchased from Lenscrafters.  I will happily buy from Optical4less again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Laura</b>&nbsp;14 Aug 2004, 18:50</p><p>Don't buy from Optical4less.com, they are fraud.</p><p></p><hr>
