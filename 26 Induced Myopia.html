<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;30 Jul 2018, 03:15</p><p>Dan  </p><p> I encourage you to buy as many pairs of glasses from Zenni as possible. </p><p> It is so easy to buy them with your credit cards, and worry about the cost later. </p><p> I have referred many people to Zenni, some that really never needed glasses, and many that I have helped to ruin there vision. </p><p> Be sure to mention my name, Jim Boice in the comments part of the order form, so that I get my commission, and buy the most expensive frames, lenses, and coatings, so that my commission is larger. Don't forget to order prescription sunglasses in all of the prescriptions also.</p><p></p><hr>

I jizzed when I read your posting, and I am getting more excited by reading what you want to do on my personal fetish website here.  It would be a cream dream if you want to have sex sometime??</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>makememyopic</b>&nbsp;29 Jul 2018, 10:35</p><p>I want to be myopic but i have no way of doing it because i know you need 2 wear over correction 24/7 which i cant do living with my parents since we dont have a mailbox just a post office box theres no way i could get glasses on line without them knowing... i would like 2 be around -4 or so is there any way to do this without glasses? I think contacts would work but again how to I acquire them? my best friends mom is myopic -5.5 according 2 her cl box and i'm always tempted to take a couple every time i sleep over but no way i think. no way am i going to steal. so i just want 2 know is there any other way to be myopic?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2018, 13:24</p><p>Dan </p><p>Age plays a role in answering your question. The younger you are the more tolerant your eyes should be to wearing more over correction. If you look back you will see that "MROP" eyes were very tolerant to her wearing considerable over correction without any problems and her eyes adjusted to her glasses rather easily as well. That allowed her eyesight to deteriorate rather quickly as well. She went from having perfect eyesight to being pretty much unable to function without glasses in just a few months time.  </p><p>If you're now wearing -1.50 glasses and that's your actual prescription I would suggest starting off with going to -2.50 as your first over correction and see how well your eyes react to those glasses and then as soon as you have fully adjusted to that prescription you should increases to -3.50. remember Zenni (zenni.com) has a very nice selection of glasses including prescription for as low as $6.95 so buying your glasses won't break the bank. You probably spend more than that for lunch?    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dan</b>&nbsp;25 Jul 2018, 09:13</p><p>Question about overcorrection... </p><p> </p><p>How much overcorrection could one get away with if they had a RX of -1.5? Could you go with -3.5 and function? Or would you have to slowly step up by doing -2 first? Alternatively, could you try -5 and adapt in a short amount of time? </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2018, 11:24</p><p>MROP </p><p> </p><p>Sorry to hear that.  If you read between the lines, I was actually interested in taking you on a date.  I've been heavily masturbating about you for a long time now.  Seeing you in glasses and in person would have made my fantasy come alive.  Do you ever rub your glasses on your privates when you masturbate?  Personally I lover to lick the lenses and then run them over the crack in my ass and over my balls.  It is actually quite stimulating.  I am glad you have stronger glasses now because sometimes the thinner lenses crack easier when I get really going on them. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe we can still do lenschat?  I would love to get to know you more.  In fact, my body aches to know you more.  Please let me know.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2018, 09:56</p><p>Im totally happy being as nearsighted as I am. I can see with my glasses and contacts, thats all that really matters!  </p><p> </p><p>I knew this friend before I started wearing glasses yes. Ive just said to her that I probably needed them for a while and that my eyes were straining for a few years! She didnt really ask a lot! I could see okay with her glasses but it wasnt the super crisp vision I get with my astigmatism lenses.  </p><p> </p><p>I am shocked that a year ago I had perfect eyesight and now I am completely dependent on a glasses prescription. Without glasses or contacts I simply couldnt perform day to day tasks!  </p><p> </p><p>I wear my glasses most places to be honest. Dates arent my thing but I wouldnt be against wearing my glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2018, 08:48</p><p>MROP </p><p>The comment posted on "22 Jul 2018 10:48" wasn't from me. I have intention of going anywhere.  </p><p>I disagree with "Likelenses's" thinking when he says that your eyesight will continue to deteriorate even though you have stopped wearing over correction. You should be pretty close to  your final prescription. So you shouldn't need much if any  any change in your glasses soon.  </p><p>You originally were hoping to get your eyes to around -2.00. You have surpassed that by about a full diopter, but you really don't seem to mind at all being as nearsighted as you are now? I'm sure that you notice how much smaller your eyes appear to be looking through your lenses now. But you probably  really like how your glasses look since they are strong enough to show some nice "cut-in" and some nice power rings as well. So i'm sure that glasses look very nice on you. And by having contacts you can still look the same way you used to look before you started wearing glasses. Kind of like having the best of 3 worlds. You can still look the way you used to look before you started wearing glasses and you have your glasses look and by simply removing your glasses you have that 3rd world of blurriness you can go to whenever you want.  </p><p>So I assume the friend you met for lunch is someone you knew before you started wearing glasses? If so i'm sure she wonders how your eyesight got so bad in such a short time. It probably took her about 3 - 5 years for her eyesight to get to -3.25. When you exchanged glasses with her did you notice the lack of astigmatisms in her glasses? Were you able tot see nearly perfectly wearing her glasses? And did your friend notice any difference wearing your glasses because of the astigmatisms in your glasses? Always fun to swap glasses with someone else. Usually most people enjoy it more if the glasses they switching to are stronger than their own. I'm sure your friend is shocked at how fast your eyesight has deteriorated in just a years time. Even you have to be shocked that a year ago you had perfect vision and could see perfect without glasses and now without your glasses everything is a complete blur now.  </p><p>When you go on a date do you wear your glasses or do you wear contacts?     </p><p>    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2018, 10:48</p><p>MROP </p><p> </p><p>I don't want you to take this the wrong way but I am leaving eyescene.

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2018, 09:32</p><p>SOundmanpt and co,  </p><p> </p><p>Hello! Another 5 weeks has gone by and this week another trip to the optician saw me get another increase in prescription, although a much smaller one this time which must mean me wearing my actual prescription lenses instead of over correction has begun to slow down my eyes becoming more myopic!  </p><p> </p><p>My previous prescription stood at L: -2.50 -0.75 180, R: -2.75 -1.00 10. </p><p>My new prescription reads L: -3.25 1.00 180, R: -3.00 -1.00 10.  </p><p> </p><p>So as you can see my left eye has increased by -0.75 whilst my astigmatism has also increased by 0.25, and my right eye has increased by just -0.25 with the astigmatism staying the same.  </p><p> </p><p>This is about right I suppose as I was just noticing things being a little hazy, but nothing horrendous. Had I not arranged the appointment at my last visit 5 weeks ago I wouldnt have gone to get the new prescription as Im doing fine. I have decided to fill it though and today picked up my new glasses. Once again everything is crisp clear, yet this pair have very clear cut ins and power rings which I must admit I do like!  </p><p> </p><p>I had lunch with a friend after collecting my glasses, one who wears -3.25 prescription herself and has done for many years. She was shocked to see my wearing such strong glasses in such short time but didnt seem too bothered by it, just asked me if everything was clearer with her new glasses, then we swapped our glasses for a bit to see if we could see through eachothers! We could quite well but she has no astigmatism correction so I didnt spend too long wearing her lenses. She complimented me on my glasses and was glad she had another friend who had eyesight similar to her! We also compared what we could and couldnt see without our glasses. This was quite fun. I was explaining how a year ago I didnt even need correction and she was shocked at how my eyes deteriorated in such little time. Little does she know that I was aiming for this! </p><p></p><hr>

The best way to do that is with a hammer, but some people think it works better with boots.  Either way, in my experience I have found that broken glasses will help heal your eyes faster.  You don't become as dependent upon them because you don't have them.  I don't want to disparage others here who pretend to be me or someone else, but I want to give you the best advice for your situation.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2018, 07:00</p><p>jen </p><p>Even by wearing your -2.00 glasses full time most likely your eyes will only get to around -1.00 to maybe -1.50. In order to get closer to being -2.00 you're going to need to order glasses that bare about -3.00 or -3.50. At -2.00, if you get to that, you're going to probably be wearing your glasses full time in order to see clearly. Without glasses your eyesight will be too blurry to function the same way as you were before you started wearing glasses. You will only be able to see at short distances without your glasses and you will be more comfortable keeping your glasses on at all times.  </p><p>So if you now have perfect vision and you enjoy being able to see things perfectly without glasses then you should stop wearing your -2.00 now. Once your eyes start changing it will be permanent and you won't ever be able to see clearly again without glasses. So be sure of what you want because there is no going back if you were to change your mind. So you need to decide if you're going to be a happy girl wearing glasses for the rest of your life or not. If you really like wearing glasses and really want to wear glasses then you should proceed. I just want you to fully understand that what you're wanting to do will ruin your now perfect eyesight forever.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2018, 20:36</p><p>jen  </p><p>I meant to say no farther than twenty inches for the computer. </p><p>Actually try to work on reading even closer. </p><p>Squinting a bit when looking at distant things with glasses on also helps. These are habits that myopic people have, and you need to adopt them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2018, 20:28</p><p>jen  </p><p>Even at thirty years of age it is still possible to induce myopia, however it will most likely be pseudo myopia. </p><p>But it will require you to wear minus glasses for distance. </p><p>If the minus two lenses are comfortable, you need to wear them all the time, and it is especially important to wear them for reading, and all close work. Doing this will strengthen your cillary muscles to the point that you should not need plus lenses. </p><p> Also in your case, you must read  at no farther than twelve inches, and for computer work no closer than twenty inches. </p><p>You may get lucky and induce what is known as adult onset myopia,in which case you may wind up with glasses stronger than minus two.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jen</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2018, 16:10</p><p>my eyes don't feel tired sorry! yes when i take the glasses off its blurry after 2 metres away. if my vision staying that blurry i would have to wear the glasses full-time then. what are you if i started this years ago how nearsighted could i have got?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2018, 15:43</p><p>Jen </p><p>Your eyes feel tired because right now they are working hard to focus. But the more you wear your glasses the less tired your eyes will feel. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2018, 15:41</p><p>jen </p><p>May I ask how old you are? That is important for "inducing myopia" The older you are the harder it will be to induce anything. If you are under 20 you should be able to induce rather easily by simply wearing the glasses you got from Amazon full time. That means from the minute you open your eyes each day until you close them to go to sleep at night.  </p><p>It's very normal that those glasses would feel strong at first,  but as you are finding out the longer you have them on the more your eyes are trying to adjust to them. With full time wear and depending on your age you should start to see some results in a few weeks time. In other words thing in the distance should start becoming slightly blurry when you take your glasses off. You want the blur to start taking longer and longer to go away until it doesn't go away completely anymore.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ben Victor</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2018, 10:50</p><p>Greetings, Cactus Jack. </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for your response, and welcome back! (: </p><p>I've worn the -4.50D for 3 months now and they are very uncomfortable, my eyes hurt almost everyday. I am thinking about going down to  -2.50 or -3.00...  I know that going down to either of the two aforementioned prescriptions would make my eyes hurt less. I like the power rings on -3.00 lenses though. </p><p>A lower prescription would slow my progress in inducing myopia (ciliary muscles would strain too much, i.e works less, and my eyes wouldn't hurt too much), right? So, which should I get, the -2.50 or -3.00? </p><p> </p><p>About my previous post - Yes, I typed "Over correction + excessive near work". What I actually meant was "wearing over correction and doing excessive near work". I hope that helps... English is not my first language, lol. Thank you for your response in advance!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;04 Jul 2018, 01:45</p><p>Ben Victor, </p><p>Sorry to be so slow answering, I was out of town from the date of your post until today. </p><p>Do not let the calendar control when you decide to increase your over correction. Particularly, when deciding to make small increases. I suggest making the decision on when to try an increase, base on two things, your long term goal and your comfort with the glasses you are wearing.  If the over correction you are wearing is comfortable, consider a moderate increase, no matter how long you have been wearing a pair of glasses.  By moderate I mean an increase of less than -1.00. </p><p>If you have been wearing your current -4.50 glasses for 3 months and they are comfortable in your visual environment, order some -5.00 and if the glasses are fairly low cost, consider a -5.50 also.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2018, 17:10</p><p>Jen </p><p>I think "Josh" is probably right at the age of 30 there is very little chance that you can induce any myopia (nearsightedness) But of course there is no harm in trying. However your eyes should be more than able to tolerate wearing minus glasses and probably -1.00 would be a good place to start. Do you plan on wearing glasses full time as long as their for distance? If so you may be able to get a bit nearsighted wearing them. Everyone is different and that includes their eyes. But even if your eyes only remain 20/20 (perfect) it should help in holding off the need for reading glasses longer. I would suggest ordering your glasses form Zenni (zennioptical.com) You should be able to find a really cute pair of glasses for that you can order with that prescription for under $13.00. I would also get the optional AR coating (anti-reflective) added to your glasses because if you're going to be wearing glasses you don't want glare and reflections coming off your glasses which can be very annoying to a glasses wearer. You should probably also order a pair of prescription sunglasses at the same time because as your eyes adjust to the prescription you're going to need prescription sunglasses when you drive.    </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Jul 2018, 11:19</p><p>Nora </p><p>I do believe this to you. The other comments didn't sound like you.  </p><p>I went back and checked because I couldn't remember exactly when you got your eyes checked and got your glasses. You had your eye exam on April 10th and you got your glasses on April 13th. So that was only about 2 1/2 months ago. Since you have been wearing your stronger glasses for about a month now full time your eyesight has gotten a little worse than it was when you first got glasses. With your prescribed glasses you were still able to see quite well without them. Do you feel like you need your glasses more now than you did with your previous glasses? Since you said that you took my suggestion and tried wearing your prescribed glasses and found that they are now too weak for your eyes anymore it means that you now need to be wearing your stronger glasses to see things perfectly. If you go back now for an eye exam you will get a stronger prescription for sure. But since you already have your glasses that you're wearing and i'm sure you're seeing perfect wearing them because your eyes are still being somewhat over corrected. If you went for an eye exam now you would get a prescription a bit weaker than the glasses you're currently wearing but stronger than your first glasses. Now remember your eyesight will never get to the same prescription as the glasses you're wearing to induce with. So even though you want your eyes to get to somewhere between -2.00 and -3.00 you still need to order stronger glasses to even get there. You should plan on ordering another pair of glasses with a prescription of OD -2.00 -.50  120 / OS -2.25 -.50 120. If the glasses you're wearing are still available you should order the same pair with the stronger lenses. That way their won't be any questions about your glasses if you were wearing different frames again so soon. What ever you do remember if you and when you do go your next eye exam be sure to wear the glasses that were prescribed to you and not the ones you get on line. You don't want to have to answer why you're glasses a re stronger than the prescription you were given.  </p><p>I agree with you that there is no point in going more than somewhere between -2.00 and -3.00. I thinks that's a very nice prescription for glasses. Your lenses still will still be nice and rather thin. your eye will look a little bit smaller behind your lenses and you should have a few power rings on the edges of your glasses and some cut-in as well. In fact your glasses should look a lot like your mom's glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Jun 2018, 06:49</p><p>JK </p><p>I told you that there would be no questions asked by just saying that you lost or broke your glasses.  </p><p>You never want to try cheating when doing an eye exam because any doctor worth anything will quickly find you out and you would look really silly. Sorry that the results of your eye exam wasn't what you were hoping for, but i'm not really surprised. The reason you were struggling with seeing the bottom few lines on the eye chart is because of your CYL (astigmatisms) You actually have a fairly decent amount of astigmatism in both eyes but even wore in your left eye. More than enough to require you to wear glasses full time. I'm pretty sure that if you go without your glasses for more than a few minutes you start to get a very nasty headache? So you do in fact need to be wearing glasses, you're just not as nearsighted as you would like to be. At some point as you age you're likely going to start having difficulty wearing the prescription you're wearing now. Your eyes won't be able to tolerate so much over correction and you will have to reduce the SPH of your glasses somewhat. I don't think it will need to be too much and I doubt that your gf will notice the difference in your glasses. Even if she were to try your glasses on since her own glasses are stronger than yours are now.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2018, 10:29</p><p>JK </p><p>The reason I asked your age and type of work you do was to see why you haven't been able to induce any myopia in 2 1/2 years wearing a more than decent prescription full time. But seeing that you're now 32 is without a doubt the reason you haven't seen any change in your eyesight and probably won't. If you look back in this thread and read what MROP and several others have been able to do you will see that they got great results because they were under 20 years old. MROP was only 18 when she started inducing and her recent eye exam has her now needing -2.50 / -2.75 glasses. She had perfect vision when  she started inducing back in Nov of 2017. The type of work you do would have been a big help if you were younger when your started attempting to induce. Even though your eyesight isn't likely to change you should be glad that your eyes are comfortable wearing much stronger glasses than you need. Your gf is probably happy that you're wearing a very decent prescription if her glasses are stronger than yours.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>glassesforeveryone</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2018, 07:21</p><p>Hi JK, </p><p> </p><p>This sounds like my experience. I tried to induce myopia for years, wearing -2.  </p><p> </p><p>In eye tests I managed to defocus my eyes so that I was given a stronger prescription than I needed. (I'd worked out how to focus my eyes to see clearly through my lenses, so I knew if I mimicked that it should appropriate the prescription). </p><p> </p><p>As I got older I found that my eyes struggled more and more. I went for an eye test and decided not to cheat, just to do it honestly and see what would happen. </p><p> </p><p>When I did this the optician was confused. She said, you are showing up as long sighted as you were previously short-sighted. She worried about causes and I had to speak to my doctor about diabetes. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, the point is, I am longsighted. I was never going to make myself more shortsighted, because I was never shortsighted. </p><p> </p><p>I suspect this may be the case for you, otherwise you ought to have induced more myopia over the years. </p><p> </p><p>Have you tried a pair of readers on? Maybe you should? say +1.50. If you can see nice and clear close up and a little farther than that then maybe you will find that you'd be better to listen to your eyes and they could be telling you that you have latent hyperopia. </p><p> </p><p>I now am very happy with my plus lenses (my preference for the glasses women wear has changed with this too). So, maybe you are fighting the wrong battle?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2018, 06:32</p><p>JK </p><p>It seems that you have not had much luck with "Inducing Myopia" if you have been over correcting for that long with hardly any result.  </p><p>I would suggest that you go for your eye exam without any glasses or contacts. Going in wearing stronger glasses than you may need would be awkward again trying to explain why you have glasses that much stronger than you may actually need. It is much easier to go in without glasses and if you have actually induced a bit more myopia you can just claim to have lost your glasses. That as we all know is very possible.  </p><p>Please provide your age, and what type of work you do. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JK</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2018, 04:53</p><p>Hi all </p><p>I have a bit of a dilemma I hope you can help with. I'm a long time inducer, I currently wear -3.75 all day every day and have done for around the last 2.5 years, and before that I wore -2.75 for several years. </p><p>Despite this, when I don't wear them, I'm definitely not -3.75 for real. My last prescription from an optician visit a few years back was quite low, I think around -0.5 but I can't remember exactly. The most I've ever genuinely been prescribed was -0.75, but it dropped back down at a later test :( </p><p>I've been wearing the same pair for a few years now and would like to look at a new pair. Before I do that though, I think it's time I had an eye test again as it has been a while. I have astigmatism, and when I wear contacts (I wear -3.0) I have to order ones to account for that. So I'd like to know if this has changed before ordering my next pair. </p><p>My issue is - should I wear my -3.75 to the appointment? </p><p>A number of years ago I had a test and was wearing a -1.75 pair at the time, and the optician asked for me to hand them to him and he performed a test on them, discovering their prescription does not match my own. The situation was quite awkward and difficult to explain, so I'd like to avoid that again. </p><p>I feel though that if I don't wear any glasses at all though, that's a bit weird too - if I have a more genuine prescription now, they will wonder why I'm not a glasses wearer. What would you suggest?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2018, 14:26</p><p>Ben Victor, </p><p>You might consider a trial increase to -5.00 or even a bit higher.  The clue that you may need an increase is the blurriness at night, in  low light conditions. </p><p>I don't know if you are familiar the concept of Depth of Field or Range of Useful Focus that are one of the factors considered by Photographers.  The eye works like a high end Photographic Lens.  The pupil in the eye performs the same function as the Iris in the high end lens. The Depth of Field gets wider as the lens opening becomes smaller for bright light conditions and can become very narrow in low light conditions where the Iris (pupil) opens up to let in more light.  You can experience a similar effect by looking through a pin hole or button hole. </p><p>Squinting can have the same effect to clear up a slightly blurry image. </p><p>Hope this is understandable. </p><p>Early to mid 20s is where Axial Myopia stops increasing for most people. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2018, 20:14</p><p>Nora </p><p>I knew my comment was getting pretty long so I thought I better break off and add a second part.  </p><p>Nora whatever you want to do is totally up to you. It's your eyes and there is nothing wrong with stopping at -2.00. Actually -2.00 is a nice prescription for your actual glasses to be. They would be a good deal stronger than your actual prescription glasses and slightly stronger than the glasses you're currently wearing. At -2.00 you would still need to wear your glasses full time. You could still go without glasses but things would be too blurry for you to see anything in detail clearly.  </p><p>You've been wearing the glasses you ordered on line for nearly a month now. Your last update a couple weeks ago you said that after 2 weeks of wearing them you were seeing almost perfect wearing them. So by now you should be seeing perfect wearing them? Are you noticing that now when you take off your glasses things are a good deal more blurry than they were when you took off your prescribed glasses? Of course what you want is for the  blur to take longer and longer before your natural vision returns. I think it won't be too long before your natural vision won't totally return to normal anymore. What you're wanting is for your eyesight to change enough that you can go for an eye examine in about  3 months from now. It's not at all unusual for some your age to need an increase in her glasses after about 6 months of having her glasses. The doctor will just assume that your eyes were just beginning to change when you got your glasses and they are still changing. The increase won't be anything dramatic, probably only an increase of -.50 per eye but that will still be enough to sharpen things up for you with your real glasses. How do your eyes feel wearing the stronger glasses? I'm sure that you like that they are more necessary now that your eyes have adjusted to them. </p><p>I'm sorry to hear about that friend of your dad's that has the retina detachment and could loose her eyesight in that eye. hard to say what the cause was for her. I doubt it was the lasik if she had that over 10 years ago. Just so you know there is some risk of a retinal detachment when trying to induce myopia but that only occurs when someone is going from no prescription or a very weak prescription to an extreme high over correction. By that I mean well over -10.00. Trust me I would warn you if you were ever planning on going to extremes. But the prescriptions you are and have been talking about are very much in the safe zone from doing any damage to your retinas. But I still think -2.00 is a good stopping point. Besides you or I don't know how much your eyes are going to change naturally by next April? You're only 18 so it is very likely that even doing nothing to induce you're going to get an increase anyway.             </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;22 Jun 2018, 19:23</p><p>Nora </p><p>Over the years I have gotten used to being accused of being other people. For some time they said that I was Carrie, which i'm not, now more recently it has been a number of other people including you of course. It really doesn't bother me because like I have told them I could care less what they think because I know what you know. I'm not you or anyone else and you're not me. That's all that really matters. Maria is another one that This person has been accusing me of being. Like you, she knows i'm not her so that's really all the matters to me. If you go back in I believe she was commenting in the "New Glasses" thread, you will find a number of comments from her. She's a young woman that really wasn't wanting to induce any myopia and was actually very concerned  about that. She found it interesting to go into places like E-bay and buy used glasses from people. She seems to enjoy knowing the history of the glasses and the person that they belonged to. She kind of seemed to have a bit of a connection to them just by wearing their glasses. Maria only has a very weak prescription of something like -.50/ -.75 which she mostly only needs for driving. She really doesn't want her eyesight to worsen by wearing theses used glasses which tend to be rather strong. Because she is at the time 29 years old I told her that there is very little chance of her doing any harm to her eyesight because by now her eyes should be completely stable and thus unable to be changed by wearing stronger glasses. She mostly wears her stronger glasses at home after she gets home from work. But she has gone to a nearby town on the weekend where no one would know her and she will switch from her own glasses before she gets out of her car. Then she will go around shopping all day long wearing the stronger glasses. At the end of the day she will stop for a coffee and remove her glasses and allow her eyes to return to normal before driving back home. She doesn't seem to have any problem wearing both strong plus glasses as well as strong minus glasses. She first came into eyescene well over a year ago and she has had no change in her own eyesight which she is happy about. She enjoys wearing the stronger glasses I think she enjoys seeing the way the person that owed the glasses before her saw things through their glasses. She was in here recently but not surprising she was accused of being someone I made up. This idiot for some reason seems to think that I am pretty much everyone in here. I do admit to coming into eyescene several times a day but I do have a real life that doesn't include eyescene If I were all these people he accuses me of being OI would have to siting at my computer 24/7 and not sleep at all. Of course he doesn't bother looking at all the various times people are commenting to see that. Of course he probably would say that I somehow have figured out a way to even change the posted time of comments.      </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2018, 16:20</p><p>MROP </p><p>There is nothing wrong with you wanting to wear contac5ts from time to time after all even though you enjoy wearing glasses and like how you look wearing glasses i'm sure that you also look very nice without glasses too. Wearing contacts you look like the way you used to look before you started wearing glasses to induce. But as you know when you do decide to wear contacts it will likely be for a full day  because it's not as easy or as convenient to remove your contacts as it is to remove your glasses.  </p><p>As your eyesight has continued to get steadily worse i'm sure that you have noticed that things are more and more blurry now when you open your eyes in the morning. I'm sure that you're still adjusting to that as well? Even seeing a TV close to you is now too blurry for you make out faces or any script anymore.  </p><p>Being an avid reader was a big help with you inducing myopia as easily as you were able to. If you had become myopic naturally you would be able to see to read your books without the need for glasses unless your eyes were to get much worse than they are now. But by needing to wear over correction constantly including when you reading and studying your eyes became dependent on your glasses for reading as well as for seeing distances. That is unless you hold the book very close to your eyes. I don't think that you really mind having to wear your glasses for reading all that much anyway. In fact even if you didn't need your glasses for reading you would probably keep them on anyway.  </p><p>I just hope that now that your as nearsighted as you are that you don't become unhappy with your flawed eyesight and start regretting your decision to ruin your perfect eyesight. Of course if were to regret it you would have the option of lasik.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Antonio</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2018, 12:40</p><p>MROP, </p><p> </p><p>given how much your eyesight already has gone worse in such a small period of time,  </p><p>I would ask you not to wear any overcorrection any more. </p><p>It might be your eyes now get weaker and weaker each half year on their own puttung you behind really thick lenses all day. Sometimes that process slows down at 24 yrs old. For some it nearly ever does and those might get really bad eyes. Mine are that shortsighted now at -7.5 because of all of my studies and recently using mobiles I hardly can.t find my own glasses if they fell down next to my feet.  </p><p>So please stop wearing any overcorrection. I never did that anyway. Just an advice. Take care</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;19 Jun 2018, 02:24</p><p>SOundmanpt,  </p><p> </p><p>Yeah my astigmatisms would stop me doing it again, but I was also very glad to put my glasses back on at the end of the day, it was a huge relief!  </p><p> </p><p>Youre right, it is easier to just wear my glasses so I can take them off whenever I choose!  </p><p> </p><p>Id never imagine Id wake up to just blur! Its unbelievable because my television is only just over a metre from me in my bedroom by. I cant even see that properly without putting my glasses on first. Its just as if everything is in colourful smudges, nothing is defined at all and I cannot make out individual objects. I do enjoy this, and enjoy seeing the difference when I put my glasses on.  </p><p> </p><p>Reading is one thing thats surprised me. I am an avid reader however now I am unable to read without my glasses at all. If I read without them I end up holding the book incredibly close to my face and find myself straining.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2018, 15:34</p><p>MROP </p><p>Unfortunately headaches are the downside because you can only go without your glasses for a short period of time. If you were only nearsighted you could enjoy the blur and be headache free for as long as you wished to. That's too bad because you clearly enjoy the blur you get as much as you enjoy wearing glasses and contacts. But even without any astigmatisms I don't think you would enjoy having your eyes uncorrected for a full day anymore anyway. I'n sure the day you did that it had to feel really good to put your glasses back on so you could see properly again.  </p><p>Using your -3.50 glasses is the better option for you because as you have been finding out with theses recent changes in your eyesight, your eyes do much better with being over corrected then they do being under corrected. That's why you notice right away when your eyes have gotten worse.  </p><p>I still think that you're going to be wearing glasses much more often than you wear contacts. One reason is because it's so much easier to just take your glasses off anytime you feel like you want to go in to your own little blurry world. You can't do that nearly as easy if you're wearing contacts. I'm sure a few months ago you wondered if you would ever be able to wake up unable to see anything clearly until you put on your glasses or contacts. And now you have to be living your dream.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2018, 14:42</p><p>Likelenses </p><p> </p><p>There is no specific hormone for eye elongation.  I would like to hear more about the name of the hormone your referring to.  What are you're sources and where are the scientific studies.  I am inclined to believe you make up many of the things you talk about because they are not based in reality.  You're myopic bulge is another example.  Being nearsighted does not change any physical outer characteristics of the eye.  I have tolerated you for  along time but you are often full of BS. </p><p> </p><p>This posting is from ME.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2018, 11:49</p><p>MROP </p><p>Because of your astigmatisms which as you know if you go very long without your glasses you're going to get a headache is probably a good reason not to try going all day without your glasses anymore.  </p><p>I'm not sure I agree with your doctor that your astigmatisms are so awful. At -1.00 and -.75 that's not really much at all but it doesn't take much before you start needing glasses to correct it. He's right that if that was all your prescription was you would still need to wear glasses full time. But NOT because you couldn't see well enough to get by but rather because of headaches. It would be very much like when you first started wearing glasses/ You were able to see fine with your glasses but you also could see fine when you took them off. Maybe just a little bit fuzzy but not enough that you couldn't read a sign in the distance perfectly. I had a friend that all her prescription was plano -.75 180 in both eyes. She was shocked when she found out that she needed to get glasses but even more shocked when she was told that she needed to wear them full time. When I met her she had already had her glasses for about a month or so and she showed me how she was able to read car plates on a dark parking lot without her glasses. She did admit that with her glasses it was easier to read the numbers. But if she had her glasses off for more than a few minutes she would get a nasty headache. Her next eye exam she was increased to -1.00 both eyes but no more increases after that. I really don't see why he would think that as being awful. And I really don't expect any or very little change in that number from now now.  </p><p>Of course no problem with adjusting to your new prescription since your eyes are still used to your -3.50 glasses. You're caring your previous glasses as your backup pair but to be honest after a few weeks of wearing your new glasses your old glasses are going to be too weak for your eyes to be of much use to you. They won't be strong enough that you will be able to can see well enough to drive wearing them which is the main thing you need to have spare glasses for. You should make your -3.50 glasses your spare glasses or go on line and order an other pair in your actual prescription. </p><p>Your a 19 year old girl so sometimes it might be nice not to be wearing glasses when you're dressing up. Nothing wrong with wearing contacts to change your looks back to the way you used to look before you started wearing glasses. I think you still prefer yourself wearing glasses more than you do without glasses. But nice to have the option when you want and nice that both give you perfect eyesight.    </p><p>          </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2018, 09:25</p><p>Wannbemyopic  </p><p>Well from what you say you're now doing everything correctly. You're about the same age as MROP is and like you have seen she has gotten the results she was hoping for. Hard to say why her eyes seemed so easily changed for her. And of course wearing contacts should give you the same results as wearing glasses would do. Wearing -6.00 contacts should be more than enough to cause change and 2 months should be showing at least some change in your eyesight. I wonder if there has been some change and that you just don't realize it? It's possible that what you think is perfect may not be as perfect as you think. At one point MROP didn't think her eyesight was changing either until she discovered that she was able to see as well without glasses when she was driving one night. That was her first indication that her eyesight was no longer perfect. Remember going from wearing -6.00 correction to no correction even seeing at a -.50 or -.75 level is going to seem perfect to you because your your eyes were used to seeing through -6.00 lenses. Maybe you should find an eye chart on line and print it out and test your eyes that way to see how well you're able to see the 20/20 line. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wannabemyopic</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2018, 09:01</p><p>Hello everyone </p><p>I've been following this forum for quite a while but never felt like posting anything myself. First of all I'm male, 18 years old and live in Germany. I just finished school and I'm planning to go to university in autumn. I want to induce some myopia and while my actual goal is around -1.5 - -2.00 I'd be satisfied with every progress. As I said I've been around for a while and know I have to wear minus lenses fulltime to get my eyes to change. Also the overcorrection should be twice the power of what I want to induce. I quickly want to clarify that I'm not a big fan of glasses and I love to wear contact lenses (I'm weird...I don't know I just like it). Of course I can just wear weak contacts but I want some actual need for them also I'd really enjoy this blurry myopic vision. I started wearing over correction last summer with some -1 and a few weeks later -2 glasses which I wore when I was home alone. As I know by now it doesn't do anything wearing them for a few hours a day. A bit later I switched to contacts since I enjoy it and I can wear them fulltime. This worked pretty well but every few weeks I got lazy and stopped wearing them for a few days which ruined any progress. So due to my lack of commitment all I did was wasting time. As time went by I could increase the power to -6.00 lenses where I remained and lately I've been wearing them every day. The good this is when I take out my contacts to go to sleep I notice some blur in the distance but by the next morning it's completely gone. The Problem is even though I carefully wear -6 lenses all the time I don't seem to make any progress. Yesterday was the first day in 2 months I had to go without lenses for like 4 hours and my vision was as good as always. This is the reason why I finally decided to post here. Since nobody in my family is myopic I'm concerned I won't be able to induce any myopia. By now I'd be even satisfied with -0.50 or -0.25. When I wake up I get my contacts in within 5 minutes and immediately after I take them out I wear -2.5 glasses until I actually go to sleep. So I'm barely without overcorrection at all. I'm very grateful for any advice. </p><p>PS. I'm so jealous of MROP she literally jumped to -2.5 :D </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2018, 07:56</p><p>MROP </p><p>As young as you are i'm a little surprised that you apparently don't have any accommodation left. I would have thought that after having your glasses off for a while your eyes would have slowly adjusted and things wouldn't have been quite as blurry to you. It could be due to your astigmatisms? I'm sure at first it was kind of fun going without your glasses and seeing everything so blurry, but after a while I can see where it would start to get frustrating not seeing anything clearly. But now you know just how badly you need your glasses now. Were you a little surprised that you couldn't get by without your glasses any better than that? So now you know that you also need to always have a backup pair of glasses in case anything were to happen to your glasses. You now know that you wouldn't be able to go without glasses for several days while they would be making up new glasses for you and you certainly couldn't wait for glasses on line that long. But now if anything were to happen to your current glasses you would be able to wear your -3.50 glasses until you got new glasses in your current prescription. A few months ago i'm sure that was something you would never have thought that you would have to worry about having a backup pair of glasses because your eyesight had changed so much.  </p><p>You didn't say what you did about glasses since your exam? I assume that you're waiting for either new lenses to come in for your current glasses so they can be switched out when they in. Or did you order complete new glasses. When are you supposed to get your glasses if you don't already have them? While you're waiting are you wearing your prescribed glasses with the now weaker lenses or are you wearing the -3.50 glasses until your new glasses are ready?   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2018, 08:28</p><p>MROP </p><p>An increase of -1.00 in a years time wouldn't have caused concern normally except when they checked the prescription of your glasses and found that your current glasses are just -1.50 -1.00 / -1.75 -.75 that's a big jump. I think you're doing the right thing by holding off wearing your -3.50 glasses for a while and only wearing your actual prescription so your eyes will slowly stop changing so fast. Your new prescription isn't that much weaker than your -3.50 glasses are. So by going to a new optometrists you're now having to pay for your new lenses to be put into your frame aren't you? Or did you simply pick out new glasses this time? I know you enjoyed the whole experience of getting your eyes examined by the older optometrist. Do you like your new optometrists as much as him? I'm sure you love all the attention you get when you're getting your eyes checked. I'm sure that you feel like a little kid in a dream world. I'm glad that you love hardly being able to see anything without your glasses anymore. As you can see, or not see so well, with each increase things get more and more blurry when you're not wearing your glasses. You have to be amazed at how fast you have gone from being able to see perfectly to things being very slightly blurry at a long distance to slightly more blurry and to what you're able to see now without glasses. Normally it would take 2 or 3 years to go from perfect vision to -2.50 -1.00 / -2.75 -.75 and you managed to do it in just a few months time.  </p><p>I'm sure it was quite a struggle going without your glasses for a day when your eyes are used to seeing through -3.50 lenses. Of course as long as you didn't attempt to drive without your glasses there wasn't any harm in testing yourself to see how well you can get by without your glasses anymore. Without glasses you are still able to see walls and things just not clearly. Did you notice that your eyesight seemed worse when you first took off your glasses than it was after you had your glasses off for a while. You're still young enough that you should still have some accommodation left which should have started to help you see things slightly better as the day went on. Certainly not anywhere close to perfect but somewhat better. Even with taking something for headaches you probably didn't have your glasses off very long before you started feeling a headache coming on.That of course was caused by your astigmatisms. I hope that you at least had your glasses with you in case you really needed them you would have them to put on? I'm sure you were probably very happy to get back home and put your glasses on. Yes because you wear your glasses constantly your eyes have not only been changed for seeing distance but also for seeing things close up. Remember every time you increased your glasses as you over correcting your eyes your distance vision adjusted rather quickly to the stronger glasses but reading small print was more difficult. It was much more difficult for you seeing things close up than it was seeing distances.  </p><p>Yes it's safe to say that unless you get lasik, which I seriously doubt you will ever have any intentions of getting, you're going to wearing glasses from now on until you die.     </p><p></p><hr>

The screen was just a blur and I relied entirely on the sound of the movie to understand what was happening. Safe to say Ill never ever be without my glasses now as my eyesight simply isnt good enough to cope with day to day life! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2018, 17:45</p><p>MROP </p><p>So it appears that your self testing was pretty accurate if you need another increase of -1.00 in both eyes in such a short time since your last increase. Did you have your eyes examined by a new different optometrists or did you go back to the old guy close to where you going to university at? You need to be careful because I think you're increases coming so quickly is causing concern to your optometrist. What you don't want is for this doctor to be suggesting that you see a specialist about your eyes so fast. His not knowing that the real reason for these increases is due to you wearing glasses much stronger than you need is the reason you're becoming so nearsighted so fast. What he thinks is happening to your eyesight is something that can happen to someone that has been needing glasses for many years and not getting them. He would freak out if he knew that only a few months ago your eyesight was completely perfect and you had no need for glasses at all. So you're right, none of that is why your eyesight has been getting worse so fast. And of course your young age has been a major contributor as well to your increases coming so easily for you.  </p><p>When you first started working to making yourself nearsighted you said that you were hoping to get you around -2.00. You have now exceeded that and then some when you add in your astigmatisms. You're already dependent on your glasses to see things clearly and now you're going to be even more dependent on your actual prescription glasses. Do you think that maybe you should start wearing your actual prescription for a while so your eyes slow down or stop with changing soon? Later on if you still want to go stronger you can always go back to wearing your -3.5.0 glasses again if you want. Or you might even want to wait until your eyes become stable and stop changing and then go back to wearing your stronger glasses if you like the feel of them better on your eyes.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>stingray</b>&nbsp;14 Jun 2018, 08:14</p><p>I went on ebay and bought these glasses called Dial Vision for under $5.00.  From the front, they look like myodisc glasses, but they actually are a series of 3 lenses on both the left and right sides of the glasses.  By turning a small knob at the hinge area on each side, you can adjust the glasses from a +3.00 diopters to a -6.00 diopters.  This is a cheaper way to induce myopia if you choose as you can change the strength of the lenses in increments as you see fit and back again if you make them too strong.  There is no adjustment for astigmatism, but then want do you expect from something for only $5.00? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2018, 19:28</p><p>Nors </p><p>You should be starting to notice that whenever you take off your new glasses now, things are more blurry for a short time until your eyes have time to refocus. The blur should slowly start to take longer and longer for it to go away. And your distance vision without your glasses should be noticeably more blurry to you as well. But with your new glasses on you will be able to see perfectly. I'm sure everything looks very sharp and clear to you with your new glasses. When you first started wearing them you probably also noticed that it felt like your eyes were being pulled out of your head. Don't forget as soon as your eyes get fully adjusted to your glasses and you're seeing everything perfect you need to order another pair of glasses that is stronger than these glasses by another -1.00. (OD -2.25 -.50 120 / OS -2.50 -.50 120) Even though the glasses you're wearing is certain to make your eyes more nearsighted getting stronger glasses will speed the process even more. Once you're wearing these glasses you shouldn't need to go any stronger with new glasses. You said that your goal prescription would be somewhere around -2.00 and this plus the fact that your eyes are almost certainly going to change naturally you should get pretty close to your goal by the end of the year.  </p><p>I was wondering how your bf was adjusting to seeing his gf wearing glasses all the time now. You said that when you got your glasses he was fine with it but that was right after you got them and you wer3e even adjusting to wearing glasses yourself. So forgetting to take your glasses off when you're kissing him doesn't seem to be an issue to him since he simply removes your glasses for you and puts them in his pocket until your done. And you seem to find it a nice turn on having him take your glasses off. You're not the first young lady to find having their bf remove their glasses to be a very nice turn on. And even though your bf is fine with your wearing glasses all the time i'm sure he still enjoys seeing his gf without her glasses every so often as well. I'm sure he's fine with everyone always seeing you wearing glasses now but he is the one person that you want to see you without your glasses. Has mom ever said anything to you or questioned you about why you wear your glasses all the time? Or does she just think you're more comfortable wearing glasses now?  </p><p>Your new glasses look nice and i'm sure they look even nicer on you.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nora</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2018, 21:41</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p>Here is a photo of the glasses that I talked about in my previous post </p><p>They do feel pretty strong, but the high definition vision that I get with them is a real turn on. </p><p>The only thing that bothers me with glasses is when I go to kiss my B.F., I always forget to remove them. However he gently removes them, and places them in his shirt pocket, which is a huge turn on for both of us, </p><p><a href="http://imgur.com/GgCY0UC" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/GgCY0UC</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2018, 07:26</p><p>Nora </p><p>I was hoping even though you hadn't posted any comments recently that you were still lurking in here. I'm sure the glasses you ordered on line felt a little strong for your eyes when you first put them on. But by constantly wearing them it shouldn't take very long for your eyes to fully adjust to them and they will be as comfortable as your actual prescription glasses have been. Your distance vision should be very good with them but your close vision might still be slightly blurry until your eyes adjust fully. Is your eyesight good enough wearing them that you're able to drive safely wearing them? Like MROP the fact that your only 18 it shouldn't take too much time before you start noticing some change in your vision. Your sunglasses that you got in your actual prescription won't be as clear as they were when you first got them. You're likely going to be ready for an increase in your glasses in about 3 months. But you don't want to make an appointment until it has been 6 months since you got your first glasses. I'm sure when you were prescribed with your glasses they probably suggested that you come back in a year to be re examined. That's normal. But it's also very normal for an 18 year old that only recently got her first glasses to need an increase in 6 months time due to growth changes or your eyes just adjusting to glasses. Your mother may have had this happen to her after she started wearing glasses. Your mother's first glasses were probably about the same prescription as your first glasses.  </p><p>Has everyone now gotten used to seeing you wearing glasses all the time now? It's kind of funny after the first 2 weeks of wearing glasses nobody even notices that your wearing glasses. It's like you have had them forever. Now you look different to everyone if you have your glasses off for some reason. That's because, like you they have gotten used to seeing you with your glasses on all the time. When you first got your glasses i'm sure it seemed strange seeing yourself wearing glasses when you looked in a mirror.But now it seems strange seeing yourself without your glasses.  </p><p>You clearly still seem very happy that you're now a glasses wearer. But as much as you are enjoying wearing your glasses  is there a few things that you don't like about wearing glasses? Things like going in from the cold and having your glasses fog over and you're unable to see anything until to clean your glasses. By now you probably aren't cleaning your glasses nearly as often as you were when you first got them. But still probably enough to be a bother. Having to replace your makeup where your glasses sit on your nose.  </p><p></p><hr>

About two weeks ago I started wearing the O.D. -1.25 -.50 120 / O.S. -1.50 -.50 120 glasses I ordered online and already I can see almost perfectly wearing them. I still can't get over the feeling of putting them on, or looking through frames! I'm also glad for the sunglasses, summer's just around the corner. Nice talking to you guys, and thanks for helping me finally get glasses! </p><p>Nora</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2018, 09:25</p><p>Nora </p><p>Seeing "Catherine's" comment made me realize that it has been a while since you gave any update about how your doing now that you have had your glasses for a couple months? You had just celebrated your 18th birthday and applied for a debt card so you could go on line and order stronger glasses to induce more myopia. Your goal was to make your eyesight about -2.00. So were you able to order your glasses as planned and are you currently wearing them constantly? You're certainly young enough that like MROP your eyes shouldn't have any problem at all adjusting to wearing stronger glasses and seeing perfectly with them.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2018, 08:51</p><p>Catherine </p><p>Since you also wear glasses and you must have went through those things you're asking MORP yourself How did your parents react to seeing their daughter wearing glasses for the first time? And the reaction you got from your friends seeing you wearing glasses?  You're not the first person to feel smarter and more empowered after they started wearing glasses. In your case it seems that wearing glasses has raised your confidence level quite a bit. It sounds like you may have only recently started wearing glasses? I would love to hear your glasses story. Like how you felt when you were told that you needed to wear glasses? And how you feel wearing glasses has changed your life. Do you feel like you get more attention from guys before you started wearing glasses or do you think more guys seem more interested in you since you got glasses? Or is it about the same as it was before you got glasses?                                       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Antonio</b>&nbsp;08 Jun 2018, 04:33</p><p>Hey MROP,  </p><p> </p><p>I read your message and you talk pretty different about your glasses now. I understood you sort of lost your stronger pair and now you say you RELY on your current weaker pair the whole week struggling to see clearly far. </p><p> </p><p>I think I never heard you talking like that about the lenses you wear now, sort of like an indispensable tool for you to see ?  </p><p> </p><p>Best regards from also shortsighted Antonio</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2018, 14:14</p><p>MROP </p><p>I'm not surprised that you also en joy the blur you get when you take your glasses off. That was something you could never enjoy when your eyes were still able to see perfect. That's kind of like an added bonus to wearing glasses. I'm sure that as your eyesight has continued to deteriorate the blur has gotten more and more noticeable to you. So I would assume that a part o f your decision as to how much more you want your eyesight to deteriorate will have to include how blurry you want your eyes to be without glasses. Based on your own testing of your eyes with your current glasses on if you weren't able to see the bottom 5 lines of your eyechart that would mean that you need at least an additional -.75 or -1.00 increase in your current glasses to bring you back to seeing 20/20 again with your glasses.  </p><p>So I had a feeling that you probably were wanting glasses for awhile but your eyesight was always perfect so you never had any need for glasses even though you wanted them. And living at home made it impossible for you to get glasses until you were away from home. But how long were you away in college before you finally were able to order some glasses and start wearing them? Was it your finding "Eyescene" the "Inducing Thread" that pushed you into ordering glasses or was it something else that pushed you? I know you have to very pleased with yourself with what you have already accomplished by over correcting your eyes. Have you ever told anyone what you have done or have you only been able to talk here in this forum? When you started wearing glasses i'm sure you got lots of complements about how good you looked wearing glasses and i'm sure that several of your friends wanted to try your glasses on. Did any of them ever comment that they wished they needed glasses? I'm sure if they did it had to very hard for you not to tell them what you were doing.  </p><p>You seemed to like your friendly old optometrist that you have been getting your eyes examined by. How are you feeling about having to find a new optometrist? One bad thing is that seeing a new doctor you're going to have to pay for your new lenses next time out of your pocket. Is it too far for you to go back to where you have been going? You know for sure that you're going to be getting an increase and if you still like your current glasses you will probably only want the lenses changed again. As long as you go within the 90 day window your new lenses and eye exam should be no charge.  </p><p>     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2018, 07:57</p><p>SOundmanpt,  </p><p> </p><p>I do enjoy seeing the blur also yes!  </p><p> </p><p>I was surprised that I could only read the top and the second from top, I didnt realise my eyesight had gotten that bad! Not that its a bad thing.  </p><p>I did test them with my actual prescription and I was unable to read the bottom four lines, the fifth I had to strain and squint to see but I could make the letters out.  </p><p> </p><p>Yeah Ive wanted glasses for years but never needed them! Ive just finished college. Ive returned home to live now actually so Im going to have to find a new opticians store aswell.  </p><p> </p><p>I did notice how small my eyes looked and I liked this a lot!  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2018, 06:59</p><p>MROP </p><p>I'm not at all surprised that you barely can function without glasses anymore. Even though your eyesight really isn't all that bad the fact that you wear your glasses constantly has made you pretty dependent on your glasses now. But I think besides how much you enjoy wearing glasses you also enjoy being able to take off your glasses and seeing such a blurry world through your eyes. You can go into your own blurry little world anytime you want to just by taking your glasses off. </p><p>When you tested your eyes were you surprise that you were only able to see the top line with one eye and the second line with your other eye without your glasses? Did you also test your eyes with your actual prescription glasses as well? How ell were you able to see the chart that way? I don't think your eyes are already needing an additional -1.00 increase from your current glasses. That would be a significant increase and you're eyes are likely still going to change more over the next couple of months. You're still able to see reasonably well with your current glasses so I think you be struggling a lot more if they really are -1.00 too weak for your eyes. Theirs no doubt that when you went in for your eye exam a moth ago and you were still wearing -6.00 glasses the effect they were having on your eyes continued even after you got the increase in your glasses. Your eyes were still changing for a few weeks after you stopped wearing them. No way to know how much they effected your eyesight at that point.Your young age has without a doubt made your eyes very receptive to being changed rather easily. Your current glasses of course aren't very thick and probably don't show much in the way of power rings and very little cut-in. But your -3.50 glasses i'm sure shows a nice bit of power rings and i'm sure some noticeable cut-in as well which makes your glasses look much more necessary. I'm sure that you're looking forward to getting your glasses back so you can start wearing them again and without a doubt i'm sure you're able to see better wearing them then your current glasses.  </p><p>It has to be mind boggleing to you to be this dependent on your glasses in less than 6 months time when you still had completely perfect eyesight. So I assume that your desire to wear glasses started much earlier for you than 6 months ago? You were probably wanting glasses for a while before that but because you were still living at home it was impossible for you to start wearing glasses then. So had you only just started college when you ordered your first glasses? Being away from home where no one knew you or anything about you made it very easy to start wearing glasses without anyone asking questions. People would just assume that you had glasses for awhile. </p><p>I agree with you about continuing wearing your -3.50 glasses to see what prescription your eyes settle at. It's up to you how much you want your eyesight to deteriorate and how strong you want your glasses to be. Since you have already wore -6.00 glasses you already know how thick those lenses are if you want your lenses to be thick. And you at to see lots of power rings as well as very noticeable cut-in. Did you also notice how small your eyes looked behind your glasses?        </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;07 Jun 2018, 01:25</p><p>SOundmanpt,  </p><p> </p><p>I can barely function without my glasses anymore hahah so being without my actual prescription glasses Im not sure Id be able to leave the house &#128514;&#128514; I definitely wouldnt be able to recognise people approaching me in the street without glasses, or do things like make my way through a supermarket to shop, I wouldnt be able to see anything!  </p><p> </p><p>I tested my eyes myself yesterday after posting in here, through printing off a snellen chart of the correct size and pinning it up the correct distance away. Without my glasses I couldnt read any line bellow the top line with my left eye and the second lane with my right, which if I am correct puts me around -2.50? Though this would be a big increase for me. Maybe my eyes are still reacting to wearing -6.00 lenses.  </p><p> </p><p>I really like that 6 months ago I didnt need glasses at all and now Im totally dependent on them! I never thought Id get to this point but I do like it. Im missing having thicker lenses, I quite enjoyed the fishbowl effect stronger lenses gave me, along with the cut-ins and the power rings. I do have some in these glasses but with the glasses I was inducing with they were mega clear! Im going to keep wearing -3.50 glasses until my eyes settle down with becoming more myopic and then see where Im at. I wouldnt mind having to wear -5.00 glasses all the time although ill wait to make that decision to see how much they deteriorate currently. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Jun 2018, 15:23</p><p>MROP </p><p>Always good top hear form you. Well it seems that your eyes are still changing very nicely just by wearing a rather modest over correction from your actual prescription glasses. It will be interesting to see how much more your eyes will change by you continuing to wear your -3.50 glasses as your regular everyday glasses? I'm sure that you find it fascinating how you're now able to tell when there is even a slight change in your eyesight just by things not being as clear as they were when you got your glasses changed less than a month ago. You're always going to notice any changes in your eyesight at night first because you're nearsighted. So i'm sure you are missing your -3.50 glasses when your driving at night or at least wish that your actual glasses were slightly stronger. If you're squinting to see most everything it must mean that things are a bit more blurry than you realize are you wouldn't be squinting. I'm sure that you're going to glad to get your -3.50 glasses back this weekend. Don't you find it a bit funny that only a few months ago you could see everything just fine without glasses and now you really miss them when you are without them? Just think how much worse it would be for you if you didn't at leas have your actual prescription glasses to wear. Did you ever think that you would be this dependent on glasses to see things? You're far from blind without your glasses but you really can't see very well without glasses anymore either.  </p><p>Once you get your -3.50 glasses back from your friend's car you shouldn't have any problem with holding off getting your eyes examined for the next month or two. Just don't forget your glasses anymore because your actual prescription glasses aren't going to be much help to you much longer. It sounds like you're probably ready for another -.50 increase now. But it could be more than that in the next couple months. Your next prescription is going to put you in the -2.00's How much more are you wanting to go? You recently said that you don't care how bad your vision gets as long as your eyes can be corrected to 20/20 with glasses. That won 't ever be a problem for you unless you have some desire to wear glasses stronger than -10.00. I'm pretty sure you have no intention of having your eyes get anywhere close to that bad.  </p><p>I'm sure "denden" wishes her eyes were even half as obedient as your eyes have been so she could get a stronger prescription. I wonder if she is still trying or if she has given up?      </p><p></p><hr>

Yesterday I left my -3.50 glasses in a friends car after swimming, therefore am relying on my actual prescription glasses until I see my friend again this weekend.

In this case it's the -1.50 glasses. If you seem to be able to see perfect already with the new -2.50 glasses it shouldn't be long before you can go to -3.50 glasses. And yes of course you need to wear them full time for any real results. Do you mind my asking your age? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Harry</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2018, 05:14</p><p>so I've been trying to induce myopia for the past 5 months. My real prescription is -0.25 &amp; -0.50. I have been wearing -1.50 in both eyes for the past few months. Recently I ordered some -2.50 to be ready to move on. When they arrived I tried them on and noticed my vision was better with them on. Does it sound like I have made some progress? Should I start wearing the -2.50 full time now?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ben Victor</b>&nbsp;26 May 2018, 20:13</p><p>Lou </p><p> </p><p>Thank you very much for your response :) I get jealous whenever I see people with axial myopia, I wish I was like them.  :( Oh my, how cool it would be to have axial myopia :(</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lou</b>&nbsp;26 May 2018, 06:55</p><p>Hi JC </p><p> </p><p>I know little about this, but I believe that it is owing to hormonal changes with pregnancy. </p><p> </p><p>I believe that the development of axial myopia during the teenage years and into the mid twenties is owing to growth hormones.  I don't really know, but presume that these same hormones can occur in pregnancy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>JC</b>&nbsp;26 May 2018, 06:51</p><p>The talk about the difference between axial and pseudo myopia and how the eye stops growing after the mid 20's has me curious about one thing:  women with preexisting myopia which develops further during pregnancy.  My wife and I had our first (and planned to be only) child when she was 36.  Her right eye went from -3.5 to -4.25 and her left from -6.5 to -7.25, with little or no change to astigmatism. The "after" prescription is from over a year and a half after our child was born so any temporary effect should have gone away. In this case, and others regarding pregnant nearsighted women, is it likely the eye actually starts growing again and it is permanent axial myopia?  I guess withing the next 10 years or so as presbyopia becomes more of an issue for us we'll have our answer.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lou</b>&nbsp;26 May 2018, 05:31</p><p>Hi Ben Victor </p><p> </p><p>In my opinion, if you take an emmetropic adult eye, which cannot grow any larger, and via wearing minus lenses you move the point of focus out to behind the retina, as long as the person has sufficient accommodation left, they will use this accommodation to provide the necessary plus to move the point of focus back to the retina. </p><p> </p><p>If the person wears myopic correction long enough and the eyes get used to providing the extra plus needed to neutralise it, when they remove their minus lenses, the eyes will continue to provide this extra plus, even though it is not needed in an emmetropic eye, resulting in the image now being focussed in front of the retina, and the person now having pseudo myopia. </p><p> </p><p>My understanding is that if the person stops wearing the minus lenses, then the eye will gradually stop providing the extra plus needed to compensate for the minus lenses, and the pseudo myopia will gradually reduce back to nothing. </p><p> </p><p>I don't believe that you can cause the eyes to grow further after around the mid 20s, when axial myopia naturally stabilises in people who are naturally myopic, and hence would only be able to induce pseudo myopia after this point. </p><p> </p><p>Since you are only 21, you may be able to induce axial myopia in addition to pseudo myopia. </p><p> </p><p>I hope that this will help.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ben Victor</b>&nbsp;25 May 2018, 21:16</p><p>I strongly believe that if we do it the RIGHT way, we could create a stimulus that could evoke a response (stretching of the back of the eye)</p><p></p><hr>

My ciliary muscles enable me see clearly when I wear over corrections. I'm 21, and nobody's myopic in my family.

<p><b></b>&nbsp;18 May 2018, 15:09</p><p>Ben Victor, </p><p>I don't remember exactly.  I can ask him if it is important. Remember, he was highly motivated. </p><p>He was about 26 or 27 when he started.  His Axial Myopia was about -4.50.  It took about 18 months for him to get to the point where he could read and study wearing the -20.00 glasses.  Vertex Distance effects reduced that to about -16 at his cornea or about -11 to -12 of over correction .  That was very important because he understood that most of it was Pseudo Myopia.  During the 18 months he had several dilated exams to gauge progress. </p><p>The Official eye exam he needed to "flunk" involved dilation with one of the strongest agents available.  The exam was done using a retinoscope.  To be exempted, his total refractive error had to exceed -10 diopters.  If I remember right, even with the powerful dilating agent, his total error was about -12.00. </p><p>He needed the exemption so he could immigrate from his home country. </p><p>He is now about 34 and is involved in work that requires excellent visual acuity.  I believe his prescription is about -5.00 to -5.50 with a bit of cylinder. </p><p>We chat frequently. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 May 2018, 09:18</p><p>MROP </p><p>I was surprised to find that I had posted a comment when I opened up my computer this morning. I think you meant to send it to me and not be me.  </p><p>Since this seems like the prescription you have pretty much settled on as your full time everyday glasses it's worth spending a little extra on them since you're going to be wearing them so much. I'm sure that their already comfortable to your eyes since they are much weaker than the stronger ones you were wearing when you were working hard trying to induce myopia. But at the same time they are a good deal stronger than your actual prescription. So you shouldn't have any problem at all with your eyes adjusting to them. So for now you can put your actual prescription glasses in their case and put them somewhere safe because you will need to wear them when you go back for your 3 month eye exam at the end of July. Can you describe what your actual prescription glasses look like as well as your new -3.50 glasses. I'm sure that you must like you r actual prescribed glasses since you were able to hand pick them and even try them on first.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;14 May 2018, 09:07</p><p>spartacus, </p><p>I don't understand your question.  If you are asking: "Is 5 diopters of Base Out prism enough to cause you to develop a need for prism in your glasses, where you see double with out prims in your glasses?"  The answer is maybe. It depends on many factors. </p><p>May I as a few questions? </p><p>1. Your fe? </p><p>2. Your present complete prescription? </p><p>3. Your oaccupation&gt; </p><p>4. Where do you live (country)? </p><p>5. Are you experiencing any episodes of double vision? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 May 2018, 08:23</p><p>MROP </p><p>I have 9 doctors so I certainly know how easy it is to get dates mixed up tryin g to keep up with all of them. I use a calendar and mark which doctors I need to see so i don't get mixed up. This week is one of my better weeks and I go today for physical therapy on my shoulder due to "frozen shoulder syndrome" Then I do the same on Wednesday this week and right after I finish that I have an appointment with my primary doctor to be okayed for cataract surgery I have coming up in June. </p><p>I'm not surprised that you were okayed for wearing contacts full time because your eyes should be healthy enough because you're only 19. I'm glad that you declined the idea of going full time wearing contacts at this time. I'm surprised that you would even consider it since you seemed so interested in wearing glasses full time. I do understand that you might enjoy getting dressed up and not having to wear glasses. Also if you play any sports sometimes glasses can get in the way and contacts is a better option then. But you worked too hard to make contacts your everyday look now.  </p><p>Well that might be why your eye doctor where you have been going for eye exams is so sure that your going to need further increases. He could be under prescribing you thinking giving you your full prescription might be too hard for your eyes all at once? In your case your contacts should be exactly the same as your glasses prescription. But if you're getting contacts don't you want them to be in the same -3.50 that your planning on wearing once your glasses arrive. Now I know you can't get that prescription from this doctor. So I assume that you will go where you have been getting your contacts from to induce with? So you should only get a few from this doctor.  </p><p>I'm not sure if you really need to wearing a stronger prescription you're able to see perfectly with your current glasses. Even more odd because your eyes are used to wearing much stronger glasses than even what you seem to actually need. If anything your glasses glasses should feel on the weak side to your eyes. And of course you're right he doesn't know that you have been wearing much stronger glasses already for sometime.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 May 2018, 07:56</p><p>Likelenses </p><p>No problem, you certainly have your right to disapprove as do I just didn't see anything in that report that applied to MROP inducing her myopia which she clearly did. Without a driving force of continuing wearing over correction the increasing would slow down and stop shortly after stopping over correcting. This is also why if you want to end up wearing -4.00 glasses you need to about double that and wear -8.00 glasses to get to -4.00. Wearing -8.00 won't get you to a real -8.00 prescription. Usually about half that or slightly more.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>spartacus</b>&nbsp;14 May 2018, 03:54</p><p>Hello, I would like to know if a correction of 5 prism base out on each eye is enough to get used to the bezel with prism and not happen to happen without it?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;14 May 2018, 00:05</p><p>Soundmanpt,  </p><p> </p><p>I thought so, thanks! </p><p> </p><p>I got my dates mixed up and instead of being today like o thought, my contact lens fitting was yesterday! Luckily I checked the time yesterday morning and was able to go that day.  </p><p> </p><p>The fitting was fine. He said I could be a good candidate to wear contacts all the time if I wanted, however I declined this at the moment.  </p><p> </p><p>He also said that my real prescription is higher than the glasses Im wearing at the moment, and that he just doesnt want to give me too much correction too fast. I then asked what my real prescription is and he said it was L -2.50 and R- -1.75. Plus my astigmatism correction. I was surprised at this and asked for my real prescription in my contact lenses, however he said that he didnt want to put my eyes under strain and wanted them to get used to lenses altogether since he thinks I only got them about 7 weeks ago. Of course he doesnt know that Ive been wearing much stronger glasses for months.  </p><p> </p><p>Its funny though because even though he says my actual prescription is higher, I can see perfectly with my glasses! Any idea why? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;14 May 2018, 00:02</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p> I respectfully disagree with your post. </p><p> If MROP's induced myopia is true axial myopia, then eye length has taken place, which can only be brought about, by the growth hormone generated by the retina, and that is triggered by an out of focus condition on the retina,caused by her wearing a minus over correction. </p><p> This is not the hormone that begins at puberty. </p><p> There is another possibility, that she has only induced pseudo myopia, in which there is no eye elongation.With this condition, if she stopped wearing glasses her eyes would in time return to normal. </p><p> Because her first prescription is stronger than to be expected, and has an astigmatism component, and then followed by an increase, it is most likely axial myopia, and the above mentioned hormone has become activated. </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 May 2018, 10:06</p><p>MROP </p><p>So no I don't think there is any chance at all that if you never wear anything stronger than the -3.50 glasses you plan on wearing from now on that you would ever get anywhere close to being -5.50 naturally.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 May 2018, 10:02</p><p>MROP </p><p>In reading what "Likelenses" posted  it seems to be about the natural development of myopia. Your myopia clearly wasn't natural. I'm not sure if anyone has done any studies on any further developments of increased myopia once over correction has stopped. But it makes sense that those that develop myopia naturally will see continued changes in their vision until around their mid twenties because we have seen this happen to nearly everyone that is younger and are prescribed glasses to correct myopia. It's because the eyes are continuing to lengthen as part of the growth process. Your eyes weren't lengthened as a result of growth but as the result of wearing over correction. There in is the difference. I'm NOT a doctor and never claimed to be one, but once you stop over correcting I don't believe your eye will continue lengthening because there wouldn't be anything pushing them. When you first started wearing glasses even though your eyes adjusted very quickly to the prescription of the glasses you were wearing you still had perfect vision when you took off your glasses which had to make you wonder if you were ever going to induce any real myopia. It took weeks and month of wearing glasses and contacts until you started noticing some changes in your eyesight that wasn't going away when you took off your glasses. It took that much time to lengthen your eyes. So if you were to only wear your actual prescription from now you most likely would still get an increase in 3 months because your eyes are still reacting to the -6.00 glasses you have been wearing until your recent eye exam. But after that 3 month increase I don't think if you continued only wearing your actual prescription you would see any further changes in your eyesight. Natural and unnatural are two completely things when it comes to your eyes.      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;13 May 2018, 00:07</p><p>Interesting point Likelenses.  </p><p> </p><p>Do you agree, Soundmanpt? That I may have triggered the growth hormone and my myopia will continue naturally? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;12 May 2018, 20:33</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MROP </p><p> True myopia is due to a growth hormone, which is triggered by an out of focus condition on the retina, and then causes the eye to elongate, which then continues through the teen years into the mid twenties. </p><p> You have jump started this hormone, so even without wearing a minus overcorrection, your eyes will continue to become more myopic until your mid twenties. </p><p> Assuming what is somewhat normal myopic progression,of between -.50, to -1.00 annually, my guess is that your eyes will now stabilize at about -5.50 or there about. </p><p> Your astigmatism final correction will depend on whether your eyes become misshapen as they continue to elongate. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 May 2018, 13:42</p><p>MROP </p><p>Even though you're not likely to ever get to a point where your eyes can't be corrected to 20/20. I think not going more than say -2.75 or -3.00 would be a nice place to stop at. You already know that you can't see very well without your glasses now. And you know that your eyesight is going to continue to get worse in the next few months if you're wearing -3.50 glasses. Just not as fast as your eyes have been changing. I would suggest depending on how much change you see in the next few weeks and months that you might want to stop inducing. You can continue wearing your -3.50 glasses because your eyes won't get to that point anyway. </p><p>Your  doctor is basing his opinion on what your first prescription was and how much and fast your eyes changed since you got your first glasses. Because your only 19 and your eyes have only recently started changing he has to think you have more changes coming. He would be right if you got your glasses naturally. inducing is completely different because if you were to stop now and only wear the prescription you just received I don't think your eyes would change hardly at all anymore.  </p><p>If you have been following Nora in here she is different because even though she hadn't even started inducing or even wearing glasses at all. She was surprised to find out that her eyes were starting to change naturally. She just turned 18 so most likely she is going to need an increase maybe as soon as 6 months from now and for sure in 12 months time. She's planning on ordering stronger glasses to push things along so she will likely be getting an eye exam in 6 months or sooner.  </p><p>You're a young girl so i'm sure there maybe times when even as much as you like wearing your glasses when you might want to go without glasses. So getting contacts for those times is a great idea. Maybe a special date or if you enjoy playing any sports glasses can get in the way. I'm surprised that they are't more expensive than the contacts you have been buying.           </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP </b>&nbsp;12 May 2018, 06:41</p><p>Soundmanpt,  </p><p> </p><p>I'm happy with any amount of blur as long as it's fully correctable back to 20/20 vision! I honestly don't mind how much blur I see or how much worse it gets. Your comment before about faces being difficult and being closer to signs is accurate at the moment, however I can already see a difference without my newer prescription glasses, things that were a little closer before and clear are more fuzzy. Id say more than half a metre away are blurry, but I'm not great with measurements. I wear my glasses constantly so its always corrected anyway. </p><p> </p><p>During my eye exam he did test me with my glasses and then without yes! It was interesting to see how I couldn't read the bottom two lines, and struggled with the third, even whilst wearing my old glasses! I'm not sure why he believes my astigmatism could get worse, it'd be interesting to know if being off with PD was responsible, but I guess I'll never know that. He also seems to think that my myopia is going to continue to decline for a few more years which is interesting. I'll monitor that and see how it goes. </p><p> </p><p>Yes, you're right. I now need my glasses to find them! I never thought I'd be in that position but I do like it. I now keep them super close to my bed so I can just grab them.  </p><p> </p><p>I forgot to mention I'm also getting fitted for toric lenses for special occasions. I have to go back next week for a contact lens fitting. I get one pair as a free trial then after that, I get them whenever I want, I can just go in and order! They're not that much more expensive than other lenses.  </p><p> </p><p>My -3.50 glasses still haven't arrived so I'm wearing my current prescription until they do.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 May 2018, 12:17</p><p>MROP </p><p>Getting new glasses or getting new (stronger) lenses put into your glasses you probably only noticed the difference now because everything is nice and clear and sharp again. And of course you like that. But no surprise that you notice the difference more now when you take off your glasses because things are a little more blurry than they were with your previous glasses when you took them off. So the stronger your prescription gets the blurrier things are going to be when you take your glasses off. So in determining what you feel like is the perfect prescription you want your eyes to be you really need to decide how much blur you want to see when you have your glasses off. Because unless you go totally crazy and try to get to a prescription somewhere past -10.00 their won't be any problem with being ale to correct your eyes to a perfect 20/20 with glasses. it's only when you start getting past -10.00 that sometimes your eyes can't be fully corrected to perfect anymore and you could end up seeing around 20/25 or 20/30 with your glasses. But I don't think you have any intention of wanting your glasses anywhere close to being that strong anyway.  </p><p>It was a little different this time when you when in for your eye exam wasn't it? This time you were wearing glasses when you went in so this time they checked your eyes first with you wearing your glasses and then had you take your glasses off and tested you that way as well didn't they. Did they do anything else different this time because you were wearing glasses? I assume someone took your glasses and checked the prescription? I can understand why he thinks your distance vision may get a little worse yet but I wonder why he thinks your astigmatisms could also get worse? Usually astigmatisms don't change very much if at all. Since you always had perfect eyesight until you started wearing glasses to induce myopia I wonder if being off on your PD measurement could have caused you to develop your astigmatisms. A reasonable number for astigmatisms for someone getting their first glasses would normally be around -.25 or maybe -.50. And you are at -.75 and -1.00. Those numbers are more than enough to cause headaches if you take your glasses off for more than a few minutes now. Getting your eyes checked at another optical shop in 6 weeks based on how approving your eyes seem to be with anything you seem to put in front of them and how willing they have been to changing for you I am pretty sure your eyes will be ready for an increase by then if you are going to be wearing your -3.50 glasses full time when they arrive. That's still enough over correction to change your eyes. And as you know they seem fine with being changed. I'm sure "denden" wishes she had started inducing when she was only 19 instead of 23. No comment form her in a while. I hope she is still trying though.  </p><p>Yeah forgetting where you took your glasses off at before going to bed can be a problem when you want them the next morning and don't remember. You should get a nightstand and when you take your glasses off put them on it so in the morning your glasses are right next to your bed ready for you to put on. So what you're really saying is that you need your glasses so you can see to find your glasses.      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;11 May 2018, 08:03</p><p>Soundmanpt,  </p><p> </p><p>Yeah they told me to go back in and swapped the lenses, it didnt take long! Its definitely nice to be seeing clearly again! Im noticing even more of a difference when I take them off now, but I just love the blue that I get!  </p><p> </p><p>When being fitted this time he reminded me to come back in three months again, so Ive booked an appointment for the end of July. He said that he thinks my eyes could still get a little worse and wouldnt be surprised if my astigmatisms got a little worse too.  </p><p> </p><p>Im thinking of going to a different optician store In around 6 weeks though just to see if there is any change there. Or if I notice one, Ill go back again!  </p><p> </p><p>Being around -2.50 would be nice, hopefully Ill get there! I honestly dont mind how bad my eyesight gets as long as its correctable with glasses!  </p><p> </p><p>The only thing that annoys me is taking them off at night and sometimes not remembering where I put them in the morning! I do love the blue for a bit but it gets annoying when I physically cant see where I put them! Good job Ive usually got a few pairs lying around.  </p><p> </p><p>Not sure when my -3.50 glasses will arrive. Theyve been dispatcjed so not too long. Ive ordered some sunglasses in this strength too ready for my holiday. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 May 2018, 06:45</p><p>MROP </p><p>Glad to hear that you have your glasses with your increased prescription in them. Nice to be able to see clearly again again isn't it?  Since they used your existing frame from when you got your first pair from the opticians did you have to leave your glasses at the opticians while they ordered your new lenses and swapped them out? Or did they just order your lenses and have you come in after your new lenses arrived so they could swap them out? I don't think they would have wanted you to be without your glasses for several days. Or did they still have your exact frame in stock and just made you all new glasses and put your frame back in stock when your glasses were ready? Of course your optometrists doesn't know that you have several pairs of glasses you could wear until your glasses were ready. So for now your just enjoying the increase in your glasses until your -3.50 glasses arrive. That's a nice prescription for you to be wearing as your full time everyday glasses. Strong enough to show some power rings and a nice bit of cut-in. And you already know that your eyes won't have any problem adjusting to them since your eyes have proven to be more than able to tolerate much stronger glasses than that without any problem. I would expect they will still be more than strong enough to induce a bit more myopia in the next 3 months. Your optometrists didn't seem at all surprised that your eyesight had changed that much in such a short time. However he was expecting you would need an increase around June. You got your eye exam back on March 23rd and your first glasses on March 27th (I went back and looked it up) So your eyes changed that much in just a few weeks time. So he now wants to re-examine your eyes around early August. He must assume that you are going to need an increases again around that time. By having you come in within 3 months time you can get your lenses changed out at no cost am I right? Your new lenses this time didn't cost you anything did it? So be sure to go back withing the 3 months period because you're almost certain to need an increase by then anyway. He must think by then your eyes should be stable enough that you won't need any changes in your glasses for about a year after that. And if you continue wearing your -3.50 glasses your eyes should be finished changing anymore by then and your prescription might be close to around -2.50 or -2.75 or so. As you probably already know your eyes won't ever get  to -3.50 as long as your wearing -3.50 glasses. I agree with you since you wear your constantly anyway it really doesn't matter how bad your eyesight gets as long as your able to see perfect with your glasses on. Since you don't have any intentions of wanting really super strong glasses your eyes will always be correctable to a perfect 20/20 vision with glasses. Now of course the stronger your glasses get the blurrier your eyesight will be without your glasses. So for you the only question will be how blurry do you want your eyes to be when your take off your glasses. That's where the difference will be. Not in your ability to see with your glasses, but your inability to see without your glasses.  </p><p>Now that your wearing glasses that you actually need to see with now i'm sure there has to be some things that bothers you about wearing glasses. So what are the things that bother you about wearing glasses? I know many complain about keeping them clean as being a problem and other hate going from the cold into a warm house and having their glasses fog over. Others hate the rain getting on their glasses and some women hate their makeup coming off on their nose where their glasses sit. Now I know you're very happy to be wearing glasses that you actually need now but even so there must be something that annoys you?  </p><p>When are you expecting your -3.50 glasses to arrive?   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;10 May 2018, 07:48</p><p>Yeah so I got my updated glasses from the optician, then the -3.50 online with my astigmatism included.  </p><p> </p><p>I picked up my actual prescription pair today and everything is crystal clear with them again! He wants to see me again in about 3 more months, then a year after that!  </p><p> </p><p>Im happy where Im at now but if my eyes were to get worse I wouldnt mind. I wear glasses constantly anyway so whats the difference going to be! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 May 2018, 07:38</p><p>MROP </p><p>So you must have been home again. I just know when you were before you were pretty much unable to wear glasses because no one at home knew you were wearing glasses at school. So you only wore contacts while at home. Did I understand you right that you're getting the glasses you got from the local optical shop updated with your newest and actual prescription? The glasses you ordered on line will be with the -3.50 SPH (both eyes) and you're -.75 / -1.00 CYL values included? When you went for your recent eye exam you wore your glasses with the prescription you were given and you will need to do that the next time you go for an eye exam as well. You had to notice that your (actual) glasses weren't providing your eyes with perfect vision anymore. So you pretty much knew going in that you were going to be getting an increase in your glasses. The only question was how much? I think dropping back to -3.50 should slow down the changes in your eyesight. Have you decided on about what prescription you want your eyes to at when your stop inducing? Early on you talked about wanting to be at around -2.00, which you're pretty close to now. Since your eyesight had always been perfect until you started wearing stronger glasses I think your eyes won't change when you stop wearing over correction and only start wearing your actual prescription. I'm sure that you would agree with me that if you hadn't started wearing with rather strong prescriptions your eyesight would still be perfect today. But you clearly want to be a glasses wearing young lady from now on. When are supposed to get your eyes examined again?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 May 2018, 09:31</p><p>MROP </p><p>I'm pretty good at knowing about how well you're able to see without your glasses both your first prescription as well as what your new prescription will be. Without your current glasses you're able to function pretty well, but you can't really make out faces of people until there quite close to you now and you're unable to see details and you need to get very close to signs in order to read what they say. Am I about right. The reason you get headaches when you don't have your glasses on isn't because your nearsighted but because of your astigmatisms. It seems worse now to you because once you got your glasses and your eyes adjusted to them having your glasses off for even a few minutes is sure to bring on a headache now. It seems like you intend on just wearing glasses full time from now now? But if you were to ever want to wear contacts for maybe a special occasion you need to know that contacts for your full prescription would be very expensive. You would need special contacts for astigmatisms which cost about 4 times what regular contacts cost. Their called "toric lenses"  </p><p>I think going with -3.50 glasses as your daily wear glasses from now on is about a perfect prescription for you now. It's just enough over correction to keep your eyes working and shouldn't increase your prescription much at all.  </p><p>So by now I assume that you have told your parents that you're wearing glasses now? Even though when you were home and gave hints that you thought you might need glasses were they surprised to hear that you're wearing glasses now? When do you go home again and when you do are you planning on wearing your glasses with your actual prescription or the ones with the -3.50 lenses? You know for sure when you get home there is going to be much interest in your glasses and some are going to want to try your glasses on. Even your actual prescription glasses is going to seem strong to them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;08 May 2018, 08:37</p><p>I wore my actual prescription glasses for a week before returning to overcorrecting. I didnt buy new glasses, just wore my actual prescription ones over some higher contacts.  </p><p> </p><p>I was shocked at the increase I needed and Im more than happy with where my eyesight is at now. Ive realised that it is possible to function without my glasses but it causes headaches very quickly, so I do obviously wear them constantly. I enjoy things like going to the cinema, walking in without my glasses on and experiencing the blur for a second before putting my glasses on!  </p><p> </p><p>Im only getting my pair In my new prescriptiom as my optician offered them for free in the same frame. Im currently wearing an old pair I have with no astigmatism. Im getting pretty poor headaches but I can pick up my new glasses tomorrow.  </p><p> </p><p>Im also treating myself to am expensive pair of -3.50 lenses as  reward for my hard work, as these will be my glasses going forward now!  </p><p> </p><p>Im very happy as a short sighted person and I still get a thrill every morning waking up and sliding my glasses onto my face so I can see the world. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 May 2018, 08:02</p><p>MROP </p><p>So nice to hear from you again. I was wondering how you were doing since you got your eye exam and your first prescription for glasses. I knew you were over the moon with excitement when you were told that you needed to start wearing glasses. The results of you eye exam turned out to be much better than you expected because you were considerably more nearsighted than you thought you were with the bonus of astigmatisms as well. Clearly being only 19 years old your perfect eyesight was more than willing to be changed by wearing over correction. Based on the results of your recent eye exam your eyes seem to be changing rather easily still. Changing by -.50 and -.75 in less than 7 weeks time is a pretty good increase in such a short time. But your eyes were probably still in the process of changing when you were prescribed with your first glasses. I know at first when you got your glasses in your actual prescription you were really enjoying the clarity of your eyesight. Because before this all of the glasses and contacts you were wearing only had SHP in them. So your eyesight was never perfectly clear because of not having your astigmatism correction which of course you didn't know you needed. So it had to be nice to be seeing everything so perfect once you got your glasses. And you really did need to wear them for a while so your eyes could fully adjust to having astigmatism correction in them. How long did you wear your actual prescription glasses before you started over correcting again? Were you surprised after wearing your -6.00 glasses and contacts that when you tried testing your eyes with your actual prescription glasses they no longer gave you perfect vision? So did you only order your new glasses with -3.50 prescription plus your astigmatisms or did you order a pair of glasses in your actual prescription of R -1.50 -.75 / L -2.00 -1.00? If you only plan on wearing the -3.50 from now on there really isn't any point in getting a pair in your actual prescription. You already know that your eyes won't have any problem with seeing perfect wearing the -3.50 glasses since your eyes are already used to wearing -6.00. I agree with you that you probably should back off a bit because you're about  where you said early on that you wanted your eyes to be at. As I recall you wanted to be at around -2.00 and you're pretty much their now. Are you still as happy as ever about the way your eyesight has changed? Your once perfect eyesight is gone and the only way you will ever see perfect is with glasses or contacts. Are you still okay with that? No regrets?     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;08 May 2018, 02:17</p><p>Hi everyone, jus an update!  </p><p> </p><p>So I got my first real prescription around 7 weeks ago now. I've been wearing -6.00 glasses or contacts/combination of both constantly to push a little more myopia.  </p><p> </p><p>My next eye exam was scheduled for the middle of June but the last two weeks or so I've noticed that with my normal prescription things aren't as clear again. </p><p> </p><p>I went back for another exam and sure enough my prescription went up by .50 in my right eye and 0.75 in my left. I'm shocked at what a big change this is, but am pleased with the results! I'm still wearing over correction at the moment but just until my new glasses come, with my new prescription. The eye doctor said he wasn't surprised at such a jump in a short time and wouldn't be shocked if my myopia got worse naturally. I'm not sure this will happen now I'm going to stop majorly over correcting but there we go. </p><p> </p><p>I plan to wear -3.50 glasses constantly now, with my astigmatism included of course which hasnt changed. </p><p></p><hr>

I really didn't think that you had gotten sick of wearing glasses and I don't expect that you will considering how much you had been wanting to wear glasses. So who got you your prescription sunglasses? I was going to suggest that when you ordered your stronger glasses that you should order your sunglasses in the stronger prescription as well. You do understand that when your new glasses arrive and you start wearing them, after a few days of wearing them your current glasses and your sunglasses are going to be too weak to be of much use to you anymore.  </p><p>By the way Happy Birthday. So I guess your getting glasses was already the best birthday present you could have gotten. yes you're an adult now. Congratulations on that as well. Nice that you now have you're own debit card. So did you tell mom or dad that your order4ed a pair of glasses? When you got your current glasses did your mom ever ask to try your glasses on? Of course your glasses would be way too weak for her eyes but she still might have wanted to see how she looked wearing your glasses? But even if she were to try on your new glasses because her prescription is so much stronger I don't thinks eh would notice that they are stronger than your current glasses. Of course as you go stronger with glasses there won't be as much of a difference between her glasses and your glasses.  </p><p>So is Anna the girl that tried on your glasses and found that she could see pretty well wearing them or this someone else? Kind of nice being able to compare glasses wearer isn't it?  </p><p>So you like seeing the world through lenses now that you have gotten used to it? Until you started wearing glasses you never noticed that things were blurry. But now when you take your glasses off you really notice things being blurry. Does squinting seem to help when you don't have your glasses on? Has everyone pretty much gotten used to seeing you wearing glasses that nothing is ever said about your wearing glasses anymore? I know you said that your bf said you that you looked nice wearing glasses. But now that you're wearing glasses all the time is he still fine with you wearing glasses all the time now?  </p><p>Comment when your new glasses get in. I don't think you're going to have any problem adjusting to them very quickly.    </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;02 May 2018, 18:40</p><p>Ben Victor, </p><p>I suggest that you wear the -3.00 glasses all the time you are awake for the next month or two.  When you get to the point where wearing the -3.00 glasses is so natural, you don't even notice them, consider switching to the -4.50 glasses. Wear them until they become natural.  Then switch to the -5.00 or -5.50. </p><p>When they get very comfortable, you will need to make a decision about your next step.  You may want to go a bit higher or drop back to around -3.00.  The jump from -5.50 to -10 is a probably a bit much.  If you want to go higher, it needs to be in smaller steps of maybe -1.00. </p><p>Good Luck, </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;02 May 2018, 10:31</p><p>Ben Victor, </p><p>It depends on your genes, but at 21, it is probably going to be difficult to induce much Axial or True Myopia (permanent type).  That requires your eyeballs to grow and your genes probably will not permit very much growth to happen.  However, you can probably induce some Pseudo or False Myopia (temporary type), which involves your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses. </p><p>Don't get discouraged because "temporary" is a relative term that can be a very long time.  And, Pseudo Myopia has the identical optical effect as Axial Myopia.  Both require MINUS lenses for correction. </p><p>Actually, Pseudo Myopia is exactly the same phenomenon as Latent Hyperopia.  In both cases, the Ciliary Muscles have become so used to squeezing the Crystalline Lenses to increase their PLUS power that they have difficulty relaxing back to minimal PLUS power. </p><p>You are experiencing some Pseudo Myopia for a short period of time, but your your Ciliary Muscles are a little slow in relaxing, but if you wear more MINUS over correction for as much as you can, every day, they will likely have more and more trouble relaxing, but it won't happen suddenly.  One thing that will also help is Presbyopia. </p><p>WHAT! Presbyopia at 21?  Yes!  Presbyopia is the gradual stiffening of the protein that makes up your Crystalline Lenses.  In childhood, the Crystalline Lenses have the consistency of freshly made gelatin dessert, but as you age, the protein gets gradually stiffer until in your late 30s or early 40s, your Ciliary Muscles can no longer squeeze your Crystalline Lenses to focus.  That stiffness, also makes your Crystalline Lenses have difficulty relaxing back to minimum PLUS power.  As long as your Crystalline Lenses have more PLUS than is needed to focus, you have Myopia. </p><p>The trick is to wear as much minus as you can tolerate from the time you wake up until you go to bed at night.  Any time you are not maintaining the over correction, you are loosing ground. </p><p>You did not mention your actual prescription.  The sphere number is very important because that determines the amount of over correction you are wearing.  For example, if your actual Sphere correction is -3.00, wearing -3.00 glasses provides NO over correction.  The -5.50 glasses provide -2.50 over correction.  How LONG you wear over correction is more important than how MUCH over correction you wear, particularly if you are doing a close focusing task like reading or using a computer. </p><p>How much over correction can you wear?  It depends on several factors, but he primary factor is the strength of your Ciliary Muscles and your motivation.  One member, who had an actual Sphere prescription of about -4.50.  He was able to work up to wearing -20.00 glasses by studying in university.  That is not as much over correction as it seems because of Vertex Distance (VD) effects.  VD effects make -20 glasses have a power only about -16 at the Cornea and about -12 diopters of over correction after you take away his actual Sphere correction. </p><p>A couple of questions: </p><p>1. What is your actual prescription? </p><p>2. What is your goal? </p><p>3. What is your occupation? </p><p>4. Where do you live? (country) </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ben Victor</b>&nbsp;02 May 2018, 03:27</p><p>Hello everyone, I'm male, and 21 years old. I've got four pairs of spectacles, each with -3.00D, -4.50D, -5.00(or -5.50D) and -10.00D.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2018, 08:34</p><p>Nora </p><p>It has been about 10 days since you gave an update now that you're wearing glasses all the time. By now everyone has probably seen you wearing glasses and your wearing glasses is almost old news. You should be completely used to wearing  glasses by now and they should be very comfortable to wear and you may hardly even notice that you're wearing glasses. You mentioned one girl that tried on your glasses said she could see better wearing your glasses. Did you tell her that she should probably get her eyes checked because she probably needs to be wearing glasses herself? In your last comment you said that wearing glasses "is everything you hoped for and more" Is there anything you have found since you got your glasses that has maybe surprised you or that you didn't realize about wearing glasses? Do you miss not being able to wear sunglasses anymore when your driving somewhere on a sunny day? Or are you still able to see well enough without your glasses that you take them off and wear regular sunglasses still? I'm sure that you were told that you need to wear your glasses when driving. But that doesn't mean you don't cheat. Were you able to get a debit card yet? So far no one has questioned you about how much you're wearing your glasses?   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2018, 17:07</p><p>Sorry for being so long!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2018, 17:06</p><p>Nora </p><p>Well Nora, if you think about it a lot has happened to you in the past week or so. You got your eyes examined on the 9th of the month and found out that you actually needed glasses and didn't know it. And on the 13th you went and picked up your glasses and got them fitted. Something you have been wanting for so long you suddenly were now wearing. For you it had to be almost like Christmas, your birthday and every other holiday rolled into one when you got your glasses. Even though you wanted to be wearing glasses once you finally got them i'n sure it had to feel very strange to be wearing glasses for the first time. Wearing glasses, even for someone that wanted them as much as you did still takes some getting used to as you have found out. Seeing the world is much different now seeing it through lenses in front of your eyes then it was before you got your glasses. Now you have to keep your lenses clean or you still may not see very clearly even with your glasses on. You have to be very surprised that your eyes are so blurry now when you take off your glasses. You didn't only fool yourself but you fooled me as well because I honestly thought your eyes were perfect and you would only be prescribed glasses based on claiming you were having trouble when driving at night with seeing properly. As it turned out you really weren't seeing as well as you should have been when driving period and not just at night. Your glasses sound very cute. I know what a gentle cat-eye shape looks like. Getting them in blue I have a feeling that you maybe have blonde hair and blue eyes. Am I right? I'm glad that you're wearing your glasses as much as possible, but i'm not too surprised since you have been wanting glasses for so long and now you have them. Did you tell any of your friends ahead of time that you were getting glasses after you had your eye exam or did you just suddenly show up wearing glasses? I know you had been off from school on break earlier. Are you back in school now? I'm sure that you loved all the attention you and your glasses were getting. Always nice to get those complements as well. No surprise that several of your friends wanted to try them on.  that's a real sign that they liked your glasses if they wanted to try them on. I'm sure you had told your bf that you were getting glasses right after you had your eye exam. Were you worried that he might not like seeing you wearing glasses as much as you're going to be wearing them or does he understand that you're going to need to wear your glasses in order to see clearly now.I'm sure that you will make sure that he gets to see see you without your glasses too. But he will get used to seeing you wearing your glasses and he will be dine. Actually any of your friends with perfect or near perfect vision should be able to see pretty well with your glasses on. The only thing that would start to bother them if they wore them for a while would maybe be your astigmatisms. But the distance part of your prescription isn't too strong for their eyes. So your glasses shouldn't feel too strong for any of their eyes. The girl that said she could see really well with your glasses should get her eyes checked because it is very possible that she needs glasses. Tell her that if she does go she needs to tell the doctor that she tried on your glasses and she could see things clearer with your glasses. Doctors need to know those things. Ask her if she maybe wants to start wearing glasses? If she does give her the same advice I gave you about driving at night. That will at least get her glasses very similar to yours.  </p><p>I'm really glad that you are so happy with wearing glasses. Good thing since you actually need your glasses. The nice thing about having you get glasses based on telling the doctor you were having night driving problems was because if you had perfect vision like you thought you did and you got your glasses for driving at night and then after wearing them a few days decided you didn't like wearing glasses you could have just stopped wearing them and gone on without glasses. But of course everything changed when you failed your vision test because like it or not now you were going to have to wear glasses even if you hated them. So I am as happy as you are that you love wearing your glasses. Getting your own debit card is perfect so you an order your own glasses when the time is right. Since you got your glasses has your mom or anyone else tied to stop you from wearing them so much? So far it seems like your mother is letting you decide how much and when you need to wear your glasses. You want her and everyone else to get so used to seeing you wearing glasses that they will only notice when you're not wearing glasses which shouldn't be too often. Once you get stronger glasses your glasses will only be off when you're sleeping and when your showering. i really doubt that you're going to find a pair of glasses on line so close to the glasses you're wearing that no one will notice that your wearing different glasses. I wouldn't even worry about that. After all you're a young girl and if you're wearing glasses all the time (another reason why you want to be wearing your glasses full time or nearly full time) that you might want another pair to go with other outfits better than your blue glasses do. But when you do order glasses on line you need to pan on ordering at least 2 pairs using the same frame but with one being slightly stronger than the other. Then wear the weaker of the 2 until your eyes fully adjust to them and then switch to the stronger pair. People will only notice new and different frame not your lenses. Remember you can get your glasses for as low as $6.95 from Zenni so even getting 2 pairs won't be a big cost to you. When you get your new glasses on line  be sure to put your current glasses someplace safe because you will be going back next year around this same time to get your eyes examined and you want to be sure to wear your current glasses. Every few days continue to give updates about how your doing being a new glasses wearer.       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nora</b>&nbsp;18 Apr 2018, 15:28</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p>Yes, so much has happened! I'm adjusting to the glasses pretty well do far, they were weird at first but now I hardly notice except when I take them off things are blurry. I chose a sort of gentle cat eye shape, made out plastic and dark blue. I've been wearing them as much as possible. I've gotten pretty much only good comments, especially from my friends, a few of which already where glasses. My boyfriend said I look nice in them, which I'm really happy about. A few friends tried on my glasses, and one said she can we better wearing them. Does this mean she needs glasses too? I love wearing glasses. It's everything I hoped for and more! My mom says I can get a debit card next time we go to the bank, so pretty soon I can order the next glasses. Will people notice if they're different? </p><p>Nora</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2018, 17:24</p><p>Nora </p><p>At this point your mom's eyes should have become stable since she was maybe around 25 years old. So it's possible that if your eyes are only just beginning to become nearsighted that could very well be about where your eyes might get to as well. You have had your glasses for abut 3 days now. Have you been wearing your glasses full time since you got them? Is wearing glasses everything you hoped it would be? I'm sure with each passing day your glasses are feeling more and more comfortable to you as get more and more used to them. Even as bad as you wanted to wear glasses theirs still an adjusting period of you getting used to wearing glasses and for your eyes to adjust to seeing with glasses. When you first got your glasses your eyes were still trying to ignore the prescription of your glasses. your eyes had to settle down and allow your glasses to help them with seeing which they now seem to be doing. That's why now when you take them off things are more blurry than then they used to be. It was that blurry before you got your glasses, you just didn't notice it because of accommodation you had. Now that your wearing glasses that accommodation is gone and you need your glasses to see things clearly. What have you learned in the last 3 days that maybe surprised you or you didn't expect about wearing glasses or is it everything you thought it would be?  </p><p>By now i'm sure some of your friends have seen you wearing glasses what has their reaction been to seeing you wearing glasses? Being 17 you probably have a bf was he surprised that you're now wearing glasses? Don't forget to describe the glasses you got. Are they a full plastic frame or semi-rimless, are they metal? I'm glad they are comfortable to wear. that is very important if you intend to wear your glasses full time.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nora</b>&nbsp;16 Apr 2018, 14:43</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p>My mom's prescription is -3.25 in her right eye and -3 in her left eye. She started wearing glasses when she was around my age. I did notice my vision seems blurrier than before I got glasses. They weren't too hard to get used to, and are really comfortable. </p><p>Nora</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Apr 2018, 09:20</p><p>Nora </p><p>Yeah! I guess I don't have to ask you how it feels to be actually wearing glasses for the first time? It had to be fun for you having the optician fit your glasses on you. Each adjustment he or she made making your glasses more and more comfortable until they seemed to be perfect. And even though your glasses may feel perfect to you now if they should start to feel tight behind your ears or anywhere else go back and have them adjust them again. You don't want your glasses to rub sores on the back side of your ears. I thought you might be surprised by the difference your glasses would make to your eyes being able to see things better. I'm sure most of the day after you got your glasses you were comparing things with and without your glasses weren't you? That's normal for everyone to do. Even as badly as you have been wanting glasses it's still going to take a little time getting used to wearing them. By the end of the day i'm sure that your eyes were already getting adjusted to the prescription in your glasses. You probably didn't want to have to take your glasses to go to bed did you? When you took your glasses off at the end of the day did you notice that things were already looking more blurry to you then they did before you got your glasses? That is an indication that your eyes were already getting adjusted. That blur that you see is your actual eyesight without glasses now. Before you got your glasses you were using accommodation to see things and didn't realize it. Now your glasses will take the place of the accommodation you were using.  </p><p>As far as what prescription you should order on-line I think it would be vest not too go too strong because it appears that your eyes are starting to become myopic (nearsighted) on their own. So if you in fact have your mother's genes for your eyes, which it seems you do have, you should expect that you're going to be needing increases in your glasses for at least the next few years. Now that you're wearing glasses you should sit down and have a nice chat with your mom about glasses if you haven't already. You seem to only know by seeing pictures of her wearing glasses when she was around 18 to go by. You should ask her when she started wearing glasses and when her eyes stopped changing? Have you ever tried on your mother's glasses to see how strong the are? Ask her what her current prescription is because that could be a clue as to what prescription you might get to yourself. Anyway I think even if you only wear your current glasses by next year this time you can expect to need an increase in your glasses. By the way were you told to come back in 12 months? But there is no harm in pushing things along as long as you want your glasses to be a little stringer than they are. So this is what I suggest you order on line. O.D. -1.25 -.50  120 / O.S. -1.50 -.50 120. You're eyes should be able to tolerate that much over correction without any problem. Of course you know you need to hold off for a little while before placing your order. But maybe in about a month or so you should start complaining about driving on sunny days and not being able to wear sunglasses. You do understand you can't wear your regular non-prescription sunglasses anymore when you're driving because you really do need your glasses to see as well as you should now. So you should mention that someone at school that also wears glasses told you about ordering glasses on-line and how he glasses looked really cute. Do you have your own debit card? You really should try and get one because that is what you need in order to place your glasses order. Anyway by using your need for prescription sunglasses as a real need you can also order a clear pair as well since they are so cheap. Of course get the sunglasses and regular glasses in the stronger prescription. </p><p>So after wearing glasses for a good part of the day yesterday did you find it rather easy getting used to wearing glasses or were you constantly taking them off to clean them? Trust me after a few days wearing glasses you won't even notice that your wearing them. I'm really happy for you because I know how much you were wanting glasses,      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nora</b>&nbsp;13 Apr 2018, 18:37</p><p>I picked up my new glasses today! Yes, I got the anti-reflective coating, and WOW. I really can see better! I didn't think I needed glasses before but apparently I was wrong. I loved it when they fitted me with the glasses until they were perfectly comfortable, and have been wearing them all day. What prescription should I order online, anyways? My glasses are awesome, and I can't wait to make them even stronger! </p><p>Nora</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;13 Apr 2018, 13:03</p><p>hey Nora. just checking in to see if you had a call yesterday afternoon.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Apr 2018, 07:01</p><p>Nora </p><p>I thought you would be getting that call no later than Friday because they don't want to be dispensing glasses on Saturday because that is their busiest day. </p><p>If you have been wanting to wear glasses for a long while i'm sure you're very excited knowing that you will soon be getting your wish of wearing glasses. I'm sure that you're going to enjoy the fitting process as the optician works to make your glasses as comfortable as possible for you. You're going to notice an immediate improvement as soon as you put your glasses on to your vision. Mostly everything is going to look a bit brighter to you and everything is going to razor sharp and clearer to you. It's possible that your astigmatisms may or may not take some getting used to at first. So if the floor looks a bit slanted and you feel a little dizzy at first it's normal and will go away as soon eyes start adjusting to the prescription of your glasses. I'm hoping that when the optician is fitting your glasses that he / she will recommend that you wear your glasses dull time for about a week so your eyes can adjust to your glasses. Even though your prescription is on the weak side they are going to make a difference in how you see things at a distance. You're going to be impressed with how much better your going to see when driving at night wearing glasses. Did you get the AR coating (anti-reflective) on your glasses? I hope that you did because that coating is very good at reducing glare and reflections off your glasses. I look forward to seeing your next comment after you have your glasses and wearing them. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2018, 03:58</p><p>Nora </p><p>I think you might get a call today saying that your glasses are ready if you didn't already get a call yesterday. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glass Lenses</b>&nbsp;11 Apr 2018, 23:00</p><p> Would inducing myopia be considered making a spectacle of yourself?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Apr 2018, 07:42</p><p>Nora </p><p>I'm surprised that they didn't dilate your eyes since it has been 4 years since you last had your eyes examined. A dilated eye exam I think is better because the drops relaxes your eyes which because of that is usually more accurate when refracting your eyes. It could even have increased you prescription by another -.25 more. But the downside is that for the rest of the day your eyes would have been very very light sensitive and any kind of bright light would have been a bit painful to you. They usually suggest that you go home and take a nap after your eye exam. I never ever consider the eye exam they do at the DMV when you go for your permit an eye exam  because they only check your eyes to see if you're able to see 20/40. So as you know 20/40 isn't perfect, but they don't care if your eyesight is perfect so they don't test you for 20/20. The 20/20 has a red line under it. Some people with very good eyesight can actually read some of the lines below that red line meaning that they have 20/15 or even 20/10 vision. Many times people that have had lasik are able to read those lines. So being able sit down and try on so many frames you had to feel like a kid in a toy store. As you watching the clarity of the eyechart slowly become more and more clear with each change of lens were you aware then that you were being refracted for glasses and the doctor was just trying to get your vision as perfect as possible? I'm glad that your mother was with you. She was probably helpful to you with selecting your glasses wasn't she? Based on what you had told her about having problems with seeing the board at school and driving at night i'm sure she was expecting that you would be getting your first glasses. Don't be surprised to get a call in a couple of days saying that your glasses are ready. I really doubt that it will be 5 days. Since you have been wanting glasses for a while during that time have you ever borrowed any of your girlfriend's glasses and wore them for an evening or day? I'm sure that you can't wait to get your glasses and start wearing them. Did mom hear them tel you that you don't need to wear your glasses all the time? If so do you think is going to question why you're wearing your glasses all the time?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nora</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2018, 16:39</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p>No, they did not put drops in my eyes. And you're right, I haven't had a real eye exam since I was around thirteen, except for my drivers license, and I'm not sure how much they were paying attention. I didn't know which line was the 20/20 line, but it was exciting trying on frames and watching the clarity of the chart switch around before my eyes. They told me my glasses would be ready in about five days. My mom did come with me, too. It was really fun, and I can't wait till they're ready! </p><p>Nora</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2018, 08:12</p><p>Nora </p><p>It sounds like this was maybe your first ever eye exam or you haven't had one since you were quite young. Glad that you enjoyed it. You did everything right. It sounds like they didn't dilate your eyes. Did they put drops in your eyes before your exam?  Yes you wanted to be completely honest when answering all the questions as to which was better. Even though you were almost certain to be prescribed glasses just by you're commenting on having difficulty with seeing when driving at night. Apparently you're eyesight wasn't as good as you thought it was because if it were all you would have been prescribed would have been a -.50 SPH in both eyes. But you were given a it more than that for your left eye and you have astigmatisms in both eyes as well. During your exam did you aware that you really weren't able to see the 20/20 line on the eyechart? Were you aware that when the doctor pushed the phoropter / refractor in front of your eyes and started inserting lenses that you were indeed getting glasses? And how much fun was it after the exam was finished to go out and start trying on glasses? Were you by yourself or did mom go with you. So you have to describe the glasses that you picked out. When did they say your glasses would be ready? If they said a week chances are it will be much sooner than that. They always say a time about twice what it really will be. They do that just in case the lab where your glasses are being made happens to be busy. If they were to say 3 days and your glasses weren't ready for 5 days you might be upset by that. So it is better for them to say a week and have your glasses ready in 3 or 4 days.  </p><p>You said that you don't know what all the numbers of your prescription mean. Okay SPH (sphere) is your distance part of your prescription which you say you now would like to be at -2.00. Your left eye is very slightly worse than your right eye is. Still of course considered as a weak prescription. The CYL numbers (-.50) is your astigmatisms. Astigmatisms is a bit like fine tuning is to a radio station. If your radio isn't exactly set properly the radio won't sound good. In other words astigmatisms makes seeing words and letters look fuzzy to you. It effects your vision at all distances. So this is likely why after reading and studying for long periods of time your eyes are having trouble focusing properly. The axis numbers are important numbers but they aren't power values. It tells the lab how your lenses need to positioned in the frame of your glasses. </p><p>Yes your prescription is weak enough that you don't need to wear your glasses all the time. You actually do need to wear your glasses for driving, day or night, for seeing the board at school, going to a concert or sporting event like a ballgame. And anything at a distance your glasses will benefit you. But if you're wanting to get to an actual prescription of -1.00 or -2.00 you need to wear your glasses full time as soon as you get them. First of all you need to wear your glasses to get used to wearing glasses and so your eyes can adjust to the prescription. Since you actually need glasses it shouldn't take long for your eyes to adjust to your glasses. But getting used to wearing glasses may take a little longer. The day you go to pickup your glasses the optician will do a fitting for you. He / she will be adjusting your glasses so they fit you perfectly. You want them to make your glasses as comfortable as possible on you. That means that you don't want them to be too tight behind your ears, but not so loose that they are sliding down your nose. You want them to fit comfortably on your nose. When they finish you should be able to look down at the floor and shake your head with some vigor and your glasses should stay in place perfectly. Are you excited about getting glasses? </p><p>You should probably just wear your glasses full time for about the next couple months before you place an order on line for stronger glasses. When you do that you're going to change the sPH numbers only. You will use exactly what you were prescribed for your CYL and axis numbers. Your next glasses should be increased to -1.25 / -1.50 for the SPH. You will just need to tell mom that a friend at school got her glasses on line and you want a pair to go with some of your outfits. If mom should question why your wearing your glasses ll the time you can just tell her that you really like wearing glasses and you like being able to see perfect all the time. If she has worn glasses since she as your age she is probably very  comfortable wearing her glasses so she would understand that you're comfortable wearing your glasses as well.     </p><p>     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nora</b>&nbsp;10 Apr 2018, 04:34</p><p>Had eye exam yesterday!! It was so exciting when they checked my eyes and all that. They asked me what was better, red or green, and I tried to be totally honest. Then I got to choose a frame. I asked them for my PD: 61. I also asked them for my prescription: O.D. sphere is -0.5, cyl is -0.5, and axis is 120. O.S. sphere is -0.75, cyl is -0.5, and axis is 120. I'm not totally sure what all these numbers mean, and I'm thinking about changing my goal to -2. They also said I don't need to wear my glasses all the time. </p><p>Nora</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2018, 20:58</p><p>Nora, </p><p>If you were wearing the +1.50 readers, the 62 cm you got in your Left Eye, indicates that you are a tiny bit myopic in that eye, but not even -0.25.  The 65 cm in your Right Eye is almost exactly what it should be with +1.50 readers. </p><p>The formula developed by Sir Isaac Newton is: </p><p>100 cm / Focal Distance = Lens Power </p><p>or </p><p>100 cm / Lens Power = Focal Distance </p><p>In this case </p><p>100 cm / +1.50 = 66.66 cm </p><p>You got less than that which indicates a tiny bit of Myopia, </p><p>My suggestion is to try to read as much as you can prior to the exam, but be careful about trying to cheat. Difficulty reading distant signs in low light conditions is a good symptom.  Might get you a small prescription. </p><p>You might review "How to study for and Eye Exam" prior to Monday. </p><p>Here it is.HOW TO STUDY FOR AN EYE EXAM </p><p> </p><p>An eye exam is not like an exam that you might take in school and there is really no way to study for it.  However, you can prepare for it and learn about your role in the exam.  The best eye exams are a team effort between you and the Examiner (hereafter referred to as the Eye Care Professional or the ECP).  Part of the preparation is to learn what to expect, particularly if this is your first eye exam. </p><p> </p><p>One important thing you need to keep in mind is that the ECP, has no way to experience what you are seeing.  The ECP has to depend on your answers to important questions. </p><p> </p><p>There are two parts to an eye exam.   </p><p> </p><p>The first part is the Objective part. This part consists of: </p><p> </p><p>1. Taking a Visual History where you describe your vision and the kinds of problems you are having.  Please tell the ECP everything.  In some ways the ECP must be a detective and every clue is important. </p><p> </p><p>2. Checking the internal pressure in your eyes for symptoms of Glaucoma.  This is one of the very few parts of an eye exam that is even mildly uncomfortable and the discomfort only lasts for a few seconds. There are two basic ways to do the pressure test. </p><p> </p><p>   A. Using a special instrument to lightly touch your Cornea.  No real worry there.  Before doing      this type of test a drop of mild anesthetic will make sure you dont even feel it. </p><p> </p><p>   B. There is a new type instrument that uses a puff of air directed against your cornea.  No anesthetic is required, but the puff will startle you. The puff of air is harmless.  </p><p>There are huge benefits to these simple tests to detect Glaucoma early, before it can do damage. Early discovery can save your eyesight. </p><p> </p><p>3. The ECP will also get a preliminary estimate of your refractive error by using an Auto-Refractor or manually by using a small hand held instrument called an Ophthalmoscope or Retinoscope. </p><p> </p><p>The Auto-Refractor is a relatively new instrument that was developed in conjunction with NASA to check Astronauts vision in space.  You just look into the machine with each eye individually or in some machines both eyes are checked at the same time.  When you look into the machine, you will see a scene or a pattern.  The machine will adjust its internal lenses to focus the image you see, on your Retina.  The Auto-Refractor only takes a few seconds for each eye and it then prints out your estimated prescription. </p><p> </p><p>Some ECPs prefer to use manual methods that have been used for many years.  Using an Ophthalmoscope or Retinoscope and a Trial Lens set or a Phoropter (a fancy machine with a built in lens set), the ECP will look into your eyes and select the lenses that allow him/her to see your Retina, most clearly. </p><p> </p><p>This first part of the exam was to get to a starting place for the Subjective part of the exam where you have to describe what you see. </p><p>The second part of the exam is the Subjective part: </p><p> </p><p>Typically the Subjective part of the exam starts with the Right Eye shutter open and the Left Eye shutter closed. </p><p> </p><p>Step 1 is typically determining the Cylinder and Axis of any Astigmatism correction you need.  </p><p> </p><p>This is actually the hardest part of the exam because you will be asked to judge relative blurriness of two images rather than the relative sharpness of two images, which follows. </p><p> </p><p>You will be shown a line of text and a supplemental lens will be rotated into place.  This lens is a cylinder lens that is mounted on a 45 degree pivot.  It can be flipped back an forth to bracket a trial axis or orientation of the long Axis of the Cylinder lens.   </p><p> </p><p>The thing that is confusing about this test is that the straight lines (strokes) of the letters will alternate in clarity as the lens is flipped back and forth depending on the direction of the stroke. </p><p> </p><p>I suggest concentrating on an O if possible.  Depending on your answers, the ECP will adjust the axis knob unit the image you see is equally blurry with the supplemental lens 45 degrees each side of the selected axis. </p><p> </p><p>At this point the ECP will probably swing the supplemental lens out of the way and may change the Cylinder power, while asking you which lens is shaper and clearer. </p><p> </p><p>Fine Tuning the Axis </p><p> </p><p>If you have not had many eye exams, you may be uncomfortable asking the ECP to let you fine tune the Cylinder Axis. It is often beneficial to mention that you would like to Fine Tune the Axis at the appropriate point in the exam, before the exam starts.  I have found that most ECPs will appreciate your wanting to actively participate in the exam. </p><p> </p><p>The way this works is that the ECP will place your hand on the Axis control knob.  This time, you move it back and forth a few degrees looking for the sharpest image. It is a bit like Fine Tuning an old Analog TV set or moving the tuning knob on an analog AM radio for the best signal.  As you move the knob, you may notice that the letters appear distorted (an uncorrected Astigmatism effect), all you have to do is stop moving the knob when the image looks the sharpest and has the proper shape.  It is that simple. </p><p> </p><p>The next step is determining the Sphere correction.   </p><p> </p><p>This is an easy part of the exam because all you have to do is pick the sharpest image, but there is a tricky part.  Your auto-focus mechanism will try to help, if it gets a chance.  The ECP has a couple of ways to minimize the action of your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses. </p><p> </p><p>The ECP can sneak up on your Sphere prescription or the ECP can use drops to Dilate your eyes. Lets talk about sneaking up on your prescription first.  </p><p>  </p><p>There are actually FOUR lenses* in your eyes lens system, but for our purposes we will only consider two of them, the Cornea and the Crystalline Lens.  All of the lenses are PLUS lenses. The total relaxed power of all the lenses added together is typically about +56 to +60 diopters.  The only VARIABLE focus lens is the Crystalline Lens.  The rest of the lenses are FIXED or SEMI-FiXED power.  The PLUS power of your Crystalline Lens is controlled by your Ciliary Muscles.  For distance, your Crystalline Lenses should be fully relaxed with a power of somewhere around +15 diopters.  When you focus to read, your Ciliary Muscles squeeze the Crystalline Lenses to increase their PLUS power by the amount necessary to sharply focus the image on your Retina. The amount of additional  PLUS needed, depends on the distance to the object. Typically around +2.50, but it can be a bit more, depending on how close you like to read. (See Presbyopia, below) </p><p> </p><p>This will take a little thought to get your mind around, but if you are nearsighted (Myopic), your lens system has too much PLUS for the distance from the lens system to your Retina and you need MINUS lenses to neutralize some of that excess PLUS power.  You ONLY have the ability to increase the PLUS power of your lens system.  You have NO ability to reduce the PLUS power of your Crystalline lenses to LESS than that in the fully relaxed condition.  (That is why people who are Myopic need external correction). </p><p> </p><p>If you are farsighted (fHyperopic), your lens system does not have enough PLUS for the distance from the lens system to your Retina and you need PLUS lenses to focus images on your Retina.  If Presbyopia does not prevent it, you have some ability to correct Hyperopia, internally. </p><p> </p><p>To try to keep your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline lenses from getting in the act, the ECP will start with NOT ENOUGH MINUS or TOO MUCH PLUS (optically. the same thing) and gradually increase the MINUS or decrease the PLUS, one or two steps at a time, while reducing the size of the line you are asked to read. ECP will not tell you what power lens or what line you are looking at.  Eventually, ECP will reach the 20/20 line and a lens power that lets you read it with no mistakes. </p><p> </p><p>The ECP will then follow the same procedure with your Left Eye. </p><p> </p><p>When examiner has completed checking both eyes, he/she will open the shutters and you will likely see two separate images.  This is intentional. This part of the exam is to check your muscle balance using some prisms that can separate the images both Horizontally and Vertically.  ECP will probably ask you to tell him when the two images are aligned Horizontally and then Vertically.   </p><p> </p><p>While the images are separated, YOU have a very important check to make.  Compare the sharpness of the two images.  If they are not equally sharp, be sure and tell the ECP which image is clearer.  If there is a difference, the examiner will likely reduce the sharpness of the clearest image until they match.  The important thing at this point is that they match.  That lack of sharpness will be corrected in the next phase with both eyes working together. </p><p> </p><p>Next the ECP will fuse the two images so both eyes are working together and repeat the Sphere procedure by gradually increasing the MINUS or decreasing the PLUS simultaneously on both eyes until you see the 20/20 or sometimes the 20/15 line of letters, very clearly. </p><p> </p><p>The final part of the exam is checking your near vision.  This is done using a small chart about 14 to 16 inches or 35 to 40 cm from your eyes.  The examiner will ask you to read the smallest (lowest) line you can without straining.  If you need some near focusing help, the Sphere PLUS will be increased until you can read the very small text easily. </p><p> </p><p>That pretty much completes the exam. </p><p> </p><p>Many people, who wear glasses, actually look forward to eye exams.  Once you have become accustomed to having very good vision, you will probably find anything less, unacceptable.  </p><p> </p><p>Many times, after the exam, it will be suggested that you com back for another exam, some time in the future.  Note that I used the word suggested. It is NOT a  Command.  If your detect a problem or if your vision seems uncomfortable, please DO NOT wait until the suggested date to seek an appointment to get your vision checked. </p><p> </p><p>If the exam is for a child, and it is their first exam, you can help relieve the natural anxiety by fully explaining what is going to happen and most importantly assure them that it does not hurt.  You might even consider getting an exam yourself, first, while the child observes.  Many ECPs are excellent with children, understand their apprehension, and will go to great lengths to make them comfortable. This is very important,  The best exams occur when the patient is relaxed. </p><p> </p><p> I hope this helps.  If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to ask. </p><p> </p><p>The FOUR lenses in your eyes are: (from front to back) </p><p> </p><p>1. The Cornea, a very strong fixed focus PLUS lens.  The usual source of Astigmatism if the front surface is not a evenly curved. Note that the Cornea is living tissue that DOES NOT have a blood supply.  It must get is Oxygen and Nutrients from tears and the air. </p><p> </p><p>2. The Aqueous Humor, a watery fluid between the Cornea and the Iris.  It has very little PLUS, but its power can be affected by blood chemistry, particularly abnormal Blood Glucose (diabetes) </p><p> </p><p>3. The Crystalline Lens, a very strong variable focus lens whose power is Increased (only) by the action of the Ciliary Muscles.  The Crystalline Lens is affected by Presbyopia and also the lens that can cloud up and become opaque.  A condition called Cataract which requires surgery to correct.  Most Cataract surgery today requires about 15 minutes per eye. The clouded Crystalline Lens is emulsified and removed thru a tiny incision in the side of the Cornea and an Intra Ocular Lens (IOL) is put in its place.  The power of the IOL can be selected to correct Myopia or Hyperopia if desired.  Initial recovery is very fast (hours) and resumption of most normal activities (some minor limitations) the next day.  It usually takes about 30 days for complete recovery and a final prescription. </p><p> </p><p>4.  The Vitreous Humor, a thick gel that fills the eyeball behind the Crystalline Lens and the Retina.  It  contributes some PLUS, but like the Aqueous Humor, its power can be affected by blood chemistry. </p><p> </p><p>Note: For most vision correction purposes, we only consider the Cornea, the Crystalline Lens, and the Ciliary Muscles. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2018, 18:00</p><p>Nora </p><p>That's great. Now just be sure when yo go that you make a point of telling them about how you don't feel like you're seeing things at night as well as were a few months ago when driving at night. Dom't say anything their about having any problems with seeing the board unless you really are. But you should mention how when your do a lot of reading and studying your eyes are a bit blurry when you look in the distance.  </p><p>This should get you your first glasses. Be sure when you go on Monday that you get a copy of your prescription as well as asking for your PD measurement. You will need both of these things if you want to order your glasses on line. If you're wondering PD is "pupil distance" or better put the distance between your pupils in millimeters. Now insurance is going to pay nearly if not the total cost of your glasses so enjoy picking out your first glasses. But don't leave without getting your prescription in writing as well as your PD measurement. Their going to recommend that you get an AR coating on your glasses. You really do want that because you're going to be wearing your glasses quite often when you get them and thta coating is very nice to have because it will eliminate a lot of glare and reflections off your glasses. This will be a real help when you are driving at night and even if you want to take some selfies of you wearing your glasses.     </p><p>If your mother had glasses when she was around 18 i'm pretty sure she was nearsighted. That's a very good sign for you if you happen to have her genes for your eyes. It could mean that your eyes are really starting to become nearsighted on their own. But no harm in helping them along. </p><p>Interesting that your mother wasn't at all surprised when you told her that you have been having trouble with seeing the board at school and driving at night. It sounds like she already had a feeling that you might be needing to start wearing glasses soon. So she's not going to question how much you're wearing your glasses when you get them. The prescription you're going to get unless they maybe find out that you really are a little bit nearsighted should be -.50 both eyes and it's possible that you might even have a small aount of astigmatism as well that you don't even know about.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nora</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2018, 14:46</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p>I told my parents I might need to get my eyes checked, and the scheduled an appointment for Monday. It wasn't too bad, everyone's pretty chill with the thought. My mom wears glasses, and has since she was about eighteen, according to photos, so I don't think she was all that surprised when I told her I had been having trouble seeing the board and driving at night. </p><p>Nora</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nora</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2018, 14:41</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p>Sorry, the prescription was +1.5.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2018, 08:46</p><p>Nora </p><p>You didn't say if either of your parents wear glasses for distance or not. If so do you know when they got their first pairs of glasses? If either of them got glasses for distance during their teens years or earlier you would have at least a 50% chance of having their genes for your eyes meaning that you could almost certainly soon start to notice a change in your eyesight requiring you to start wearing glasses. However if neither of them wear glasses for distance inducing will be your only option for wearing glasses.  </p><p>As I woke up this morning I recalled your comment to "Cactus Jack" on April 6th "If there is anything wrong with my eyes, it's nothing big at all. More like when I read or do school work for very long periods of time things at a distance appear  a slightest bit blurry, although not enough to be very  noticeable." "Antonio" beat me to it with his response. Doing so much close work does seem to be having some effect on your eyes. If things at a distance are even just slightly blurry it could very well be an indication that you're developing some nearsightedness. Even though you don't think it's enough to get you glasses you could be wrong. It means that your eyes tire out which means when your reading and studying you're straining your eyes more than you should be. So if you go for the eye exam like I suggested you should be sure to tell the doctor that also. The main thing is that you somehow need to get prescribed with glasses otherwise with living at home I don't see anyway that you can serious work at inducing myopia unless your able to wear glasses full time. Just wearing at school when your away from home probably won't be enough to weaken your eyesight enough.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2018, 04:19</p><p>Nora, </p><p>You did not mention the POWER of the OTC readers you used.  It is important.  Otherwise the distances are meaningless. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Antonio</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2018, 03:42</p><p>Hi Nora, </p><p> </p><p>from what you describe your eyes  are maybe on their way to start to get a little shortsighted, thus blurrying your sight far away a little after extensive reading nearby. </p><p> </p><p>Best regards, Antonio </p><p> </p><p>(already being shortsighted)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2018, 16:06</p><p>Nora </p><p>Whenever you're able and ready ot start wearing glasses I suggest that you order your glasses on-line from Zenni (zennioptical.com) You can get glasses with whatever prescription you want for as low as $6.95. At 17 your eyes should adjust rather easily to glasses with at least a -1.00 prescription in a very short time. If you already have your driver's license that's even better. Then also tell your parents that you have been noticing that you aren't able to see the board at school very well and that driving at night you aren't able to see road signs until your pretty close to them and you think that you should get your eyes examined. The one thing ALL optometrists are forced to take your word for is being able to see after dark. Many people really do have something the optometrists call "night blindness" which only means that even though you maybe able to see the 20/20 line perfectly you might not be able to see things in the dark nearly as well. In some cases it's a fore runner of becoming nearsighted but not always. My best friends wife has perfect vision during ten day and she has no problem at with driving during the day just fine. But once it gets dark she needs her glasses in order for her to see to drive. She got her glasses about 5 years ago and her eyesight has gotten no worse. Anyway if you think about i'm sure that you don't see as well driving at night as you do during the day. Everybody sees better during the day, so not really much of  a lie. You first need to be prescribed glasses other wise how are you going to be able to wear glasses from morning until bedtime living at home? Once you get prescribed with glasses and you wear them for a few weeks you suddenly lose them. Hide them in the attic or someplace they won't be found. Then you simply say how you found out about how you can order glasses on line for hardly anything. Then you order your new glasses with a stronger prescription.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nora</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2018, 15:35</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p>I ended up getting the reading glasses today after all. I did the test exactly as you said and the results were 62 cm for my left eye and 65 for my left. I'm not sure if the type size matters but I used my old copy of the book adrift on a sea of blue light, which is pretty standard. </p><p>Thanks </p><p>Nora</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nora</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2018, 15:14</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p>About the board thing - we're on vacation until the sixteenth...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nora</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2018, 15:12</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p>Yes, I am living with my parents currently, and I do have a gift card from my birthday I could use. I will take your advice and try to tell them I'm having trouble driving at night, but I'm not a very good liar. I'll see how it goes. </p><p>Nora</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2018, 07:37</p><p>Nora </p><p>I am only going to add things that "Cactus Jack" didn't cover in his comment to you. The good news at being only 17 it really shouldn't take too much to change your vision from being perfect, or near perfect which they apparently are now to an actual prescription of about -1.00. But being 17 i'm sure that you're likely still living at home with mom and dad? So you do understand that in order to change your vision you're going to have to start wearing glasses completely full time from the minute you open your eye each morning until you close them that night to go to sleep. So exactly how are you planning on doing that while living at home? Also you're going to need a credit card so you can even order the glasses you're going to need in order to start changing your vision. Now I have a way to get you stared at least. First of all I assume tha you have health insurance which also has vision included? So you need to tell your mother, or dad, whichever you seem to be able to work better, that you are having trouble seeing the board at school. You're old enough that you can even suggest that you get your eyes examined. When you go in and fill out the information sheet it is going to ask your reason for getting your eyes examined. Simply put down that you don't feel like your able to see as well when driving at night. Even if you don't drive yet. Then do the eye exm normally and don't try to cheat in anyway. Just comment to the doctor about having trouble seeing at night. Near the end of the exam the doctor will refract your eyes. You will be looking at the eyechart as the doctor adds in some lenses in the refractor and when finished you will be handed a prescription for glasses. It's only going to be -.50 both eyes but at least enough to get you your first prescription for glasses. Then you will be able to try on as many frames as you want until you find you find the perfect pair. You're going to be told that you only need your glasses when driving at night but that you can also wear them anytime that you feel like you might need them. Of course once you get your glasses you can wear them as much as you wish. Now once you have glasses going on line and ordering stronger glasses on line will be very easy. Every one will just think that you just wanted another pair o glasses. They won't know that their stronger. Once your able to start wearing the stronger glasses if your wear them full time they should weaken your eyes rather quickly to your goal of being around -1.00. You do understand that to get to -1.00 your going to have to wear glasses somewhere around -2.50.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2018, 07:05</p><p>jane </p><p>Okay not a real problem if you can't order the exact same pair. Actually even getting your new pairs in a completely different frame shouldn't be an issue. Did you only star wearing glasses 3 months ago or had you already been wearing your actual -.25 with the slight astigmatism full time? Since you started wearing your -1.25 glasses full time everyone is used to seeing you in glasses which is good. Now since your a woman and we all know women enjoy changing their looks and trying new things which can include their glasses look. So getting new glasses and having people notice that you're wearing different glasses can easily be explained by simply saying that someone told you about being able to order your own glasses on line so you checked it out and found a pair that you just had to get. After all now that you're a full time glasses wearer wanting to get a 2nd pair would be understandable. But you can't be showing up wearing different glasses every couple weeks or some may start questioning things. If I were you I would order 3 pairs in the same frame each with -2.00 -3.00 and -4.00 lenses. That should be enough over correction to weaken your eyes enough to provide you with a stronger prescription than your current -.25.  </p><p>I was hoping that it didn't take your eyes 3 months to adjust to your -1.25 glasses. That's a good sign that your eyes adjusted to your glasses so fast. But that was also a sign that you needed to go to stronger glasses much sooner than 3 months. By now i'm sure that your glasses feel like their your real prescription. In other words their not stressing your eyes anymore and your eyes are simply enjoying being over corrected. Right now with your glasses your vision is probably about 20/10. So you're able to see thing at a distance much better than any of your friends with their perfect vision. When you get your -2.00 glasses please be careful before driving wearing the stronger glasses that your eyes have adjusted well enough that your able to see well enough to drive safely. When you first start wearing them they could effect your ability to judge distances. Otherwise known as your depth perception. </p><p>Have you placed your order for stronger glasses yet? Where did you get your -1.25 glasses from and where will your next glasses be coming from?     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2018, 21:24</p><p>Nora, </p><p>The first step is to get an idea of your refractive error, if any.  Here are two simple tests you can do.Here are two simple tests. </p><p>The first is for Astigmatism. Here is the link to an Astigmatism test chart. </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/astigtest.html" target="_blank">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/astigtest.html</a> </p><p> </p><p>The instructions are pretty clear. Please let me know the results of this test. </p><p> </p><p>The next test is to estimate your refractive error, if any. </p><p> </p><p>You will need the following items: </p><p> </p><p>1. A pair of inexpensive Over-the-Counter (OTC) +1.50 or +1.75 reading glasses. </p><p> </p><p>These glasses will actually simulate being mildly nearsighted. The purpose is to get the target's focus in to a conveniently measurable range (less than arms length). </p><p> </p><p>2. A "target" which is a book or newspaper with small print. </p><p> </p><p>3. A tape measure calibrated in either cm or inches (your preference). Unless your refractive error is very large, the OTC reading glasses will make the focus distance less than 66 cm or 26 inches, which is easy to measure fairly accurately. </p><p> </p><p>Procedure with each eye individually. </p><p> </p><p>1. In a location with good, but not BRIGHT light, put on the OTC reading glasses. </p><p> </p><p>2. Hold the target close enough to see the text clearly (usually around (30 cm or 13 inches). </p><p> </p><p>3. Slowly move the target away from your eyes until the text JUST begins to get fuzzy around the edges of the text. </p><p> </p><p>4. Note the distance. </p><p> </p><p>5. Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 three times and average the distance. </p><p> </p><p>6. Let me know the results for each eye and the power of the OTC reading glasses you used. </p><p> </p><p>Note: Please do not use prescription reading glasses for this test. They could have some Cylinder correction for astigmatism, which would introduce unknown errors in the results. I don't know where you live, but you may be able to find some inexpensive OTC reading glasses in what we call "dollar" stores in the US. They may not be optically "wonderful", but they are good enough for this test. </p><p> </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Nora</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2018, 20:23</p><p>Hello everyone, </p><p>I'm new here and was just wondering how exactly I should go about trying to get my vision to around -1 or so.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2018, 12:12</p><p>jane </p><p>If your vision is good with your -1.25 glasses then it's time to go stronger. When you started wearing your -1.25 glasses do you remember how long it was until they felt totally comfortably to you? Hopefully when you get the -2.00 glasses they become comfortable after maybe 2 weeks so you can again increase.   </p><p>Yes having that type of job should be helpful with inducing myopia. I also suggest that you try to sit as close to the scree as possible so your eyes are close also. A bit  uncomfortable but it should help. Glad that you're already wearing your glasses from morning until night. Continue to do that of course. You just need to push your eyes as much as possible.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jane</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2018, 10:13</p><p>hi soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>I am able to see really well with the glasses, and I currently work with computers 24/7 so hopefully that will help some.  I am going to try a pair of -2 glasses in the same frame soon, that's a brilliant idea. I do wear the glasses from when I wake up until I sleep, though I find my vision has gone back to normal as soon as I have woken up unfortunately. I have only worn them for about 3 months though.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Apr 2018, 09:52</p><p>jane </p><p>Everyone's eyes are different in regards to how they will react to inducing myopia. At 29 it's hard to say how much if any you might be able to induce by over correcting your eyes. If you have read many of the comments in this thread you will see that the younger you are the more likely you're eyes can be changed. In just a couple of recent cases you will see that "denden" is working hard at trying to induce a bit of myopia and so far she isn't having much success. She is 23. But MROP (Molly) started trying to induce about 6 or 7 months ago when her vision was a perfect 20/20. Her recent eye exam she was thrilled to get her first prescription for glasses and she has enough of a prescription that she already needs to wear her glasses full time. She is only 19. But there have been others considerably older than 29 that has induced myopia. The good news is since you can go on line and order glasses in whatever prescription you want and you have a very large selection of glasses to choose from for under $13.00 it really doesn't cost you very much to try. At -.25 and a small amount of astigmatism you hardly even need glasses now. Starting off with -1.25 including your actual astigmatisms is a good place to start. How long have you been wearing those glasses? How well are you able to see wearing the stronger glasses? Distance and close up? Are you wearing those glasses from the time you open your eyes in the morning until you take them off at bedtime? If your eyes are completely comfortable wearing your -1.25 glasses then it's time for you to order stronger glasses. I would suggest at least -2.00 or -2.25. At the same time as you're ordering those glasses i would suggest ordering the same frame in -3.00 as well. If the glasses you got with the -1.25 are still available i would suggest ordering them in the same exact frame with the stronger lenses. People aren't going to notice your glasses getting stronger but they will notice new glasses in a different frame. So as soon as your glasses get completely comfortable and your able to see perfect wearing the stronger glasses you need to increase it right away. When you first started wearing your -1.25 glasses did you feel any pulling on your eyes? If you did that is a good thing. You want your eyes to be slightly stressed as much as possible. What type of work do you do?   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>jane</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2018, 19:35</p><p>Hi there,  </p><p> </p><p>I currently have a prescription of -0.25 in both eyes with some astigmatism, and am currently wearing glasses with -1.25 correction in both eyes. I am 29 years old. </p><p> </p><p>At my age, is it possible to induce permanent myopia? I want to wear glasses at least -3 in both eyes, if not more. Is this unrealistic, or can I continue to overcorrect my eyes, and have people my age had success?  </p><p> </p><p>If so, how often should I be changing prescriptions? Thanks in advance! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2018, 10:37</p><p>MROP </p><p>You've had your "real" glasses for over a week now so your eyes should be completely adjusted to them by now. You have to be pleasantly surprised by how much you actually really do your glasses for now. You were going to be happy with just getting a prescription of -.50 and you far exceeded that. So are you a bit like "denden" in that you not only enjoy wearing glasses but also the blurry world you see when you take your glasses off? For her that is something she is looking forward to if she can get her eyes to cooperate with her. You know when you go back in 3 months to get re-examined to determine how much of an increase your going to need. They will have to order your lenses for your glasses. Then they will call you when your new lenses come in. They are going to take your glasses from you so they can cut your new lenses and fit them into your glasses. You're going to be without glasses for at least an hour or more. You certainly won't be able to see well enough to drive anywhere. Remember by then your eyesight is going to be slightly worse than it is now without your glasses. And of course you don't want them to know that you have any other glasses to wear. But since you enjoyed being able to try on so may glasses when you got your current glasses you can spend the you're waiting trying on more glasses. By then they are sure to have a number of new frames come in.  </p><p>Have you told your mom and dad that you got glasses? I'm sure you have probably talked to them since you got your glasses. When you were you did a great job in complaining about your eyesight so they shouldn't be too surprised that you're wearing glasses now. When are you going home again? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2018, 14:24</p><p>denden </p><p>I totally understand. But at the same time you need to be careful with over wearing your contacts because apparently it's having an effect on your eyes in a bad way. Doctors can tell if you're doing or getting close to doing damage to your  eyes when you are abusing the use of contacts. That kind of damage isn't what you want for your eyes. If you're getting too much eyestrain from wearing over correction then don't wear as much over correction and you probably won't get the "fishbowl" effect and not as much eye strain either. Yes you want your eyes to be stressed but not the point where it is bothering you too much. So back off some and wear glasses that are more comfortable to your eyes and yet stronger than you need.  </p><p>It's possible that you waited too long to decide to do this. So you may not be able to induce any myopia. You're clearly a very smart young lady so I think you will come up with something that will put you in glasses like you want. You certainly already know that you're able to wear glasses stronger than you actually need. So just doing that is one option and you already know all about wearing GOC from your high school days. Too bad when you were in high school you didn't try wearing your stronger glasses without using the plus contacts. If you had done that often enough you probably would be wearing stronger glasses today.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2018, 11:28</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Fair enough. I just prefer contacts when overcorrecting because the fishbowl effect, coupled with the eye strain from overcorrection, is too much for me. </p><p> </p><p>My EyeQue vision test kit arrived! After spending an hour with the kit, my average result was as follows: R -0.50 SPH L -0.25 SPH -0.50 CYL 14. </p><p> </p><p>This is close to my actual prescription. The Axis is slightly different from what I"ve beeb getting in my actual prescriptions. It is somewhat disappointing that the SPH in either eye did not increase despite my efforts. In favy my right eye appeared less myopic than I thought. </p><p> </p><p>I will use this kit every month to track my progress.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2018, 06:26</p><p>Soundmanpt.  </p><p> </p><p>Yes I did enjoy that, only from the point that Ive been waiting for my own glasses for so long.  </p><p> </p><p>Interesting story, Im sure Ill feel the same with my astigmatism correction before long! Im loving my new glasses and feel so comfortable wearing them. My headaches have gone completely, its mad to think Ive needed glasses all this time without knowing! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2018, 11:55</p><p>MROP </p><p>I guess what I was trying to ask you was, did you enjoy having someone adjust your glasses with all of the attention being about your glasses and how they felt?  </p><p>Yes, i'm sure if you have been getting headache it was caused by your astigmatisms and not stress. And you probably thought they were caused by wearing glasses that were too strong for your eyes. Wait until your eyes are fully adjusted to your glasses before you try testing how long you need your glasses to be off before you start getting a headache.I have a feeling it won't be very long. Several years ago the girl that regularly cut my hair decided to retire because she was about to be a mom and thought that was going to me a full time job. So I needed to find a new place to go. I stopped into a chain shop one evening not far from my home. Their was 2 girls working and I was really hoping to get the cuter of the 2 and she was wearing glasses so an added bonus as well. It was my lucky night and I was her customer. I had noticed when I came in that she was constantly pushing her glasses up and as soon as she pushed them up they would slide right back down again. Anyway I told her as she was cutting my hair that when she finished I would fix her glasses so she wouldn't have to keep pushing them up. She said that would be great. she then told me that she had only started wearing glasses 2 weeks before and she was still trying to get used to wearing them. As she was cutting sh told me the whole story. She said tha about 6 months before she was starting to get headaches and they were becoming more and more frequent. She said that they would usually come around mid day. So she finally decided to she her primary doctor. After he examined her he asked her when she last had her eyes examined? It had been a while but she could see fine and told him so. But he insisted that based on where she said her head hurt indicated a vision problem. So she took his advice and made an appointment t get her eyes checked even though she was sure they were perfect. She was able to read every line on the eyechart perfectly and was sure she right about her eyes. But after the doctor shined a light in her eyes several times he seemed to find something. When he was finished he told her that she needed glasses which totally surprised her. Even worse he told her that she needed to wear her glasses full time if she didn't want the headaches. She was sure he wrong but she picked out glasses anyway. So the next day after getting her glasses which she had not bothered wearing she was at work cutting hair when she felt a headache coming on. She did have her glasses in her bag so she decided to put them on just to proof that she really didn't need glasses expecting the headache to only get worse. But after a few minutes with her glasses on her headache was gone completely. So she left her glasses on the rest of the day and no sign of a headache. The next day she again went to work without wearing her glasses. Again she started to feel a headache coming so she again put her glasses on and again the headache was soon gone. From then on she kept her glasses on as she was told to do.She showed me her prescription slip and it read O.D. -0.00  CYL -.75  axis 180 / O.S. 0.00  CYL -.75  axis 180. Anyway when she was finished with cutting my hair I used her hairdryer to warm her frame and bent her earpieces down more so they kept her glasses up in place. Not long after that she asked me about getting contacts because she was getting married soon and she didn't want to have to wear her glasses to to walk down the aisle. I told her that the kind of contacts she would need were quite expensive. She ended up taking her glasses off just before she started walking down the aisle with her dad. She wore her glasses the rest of the day including at her reception. She since moved away because her husband got a job out of town. Remind me I need a haircut.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2018, 11:05</p><p>denden </p><p>It really doesn't matter if you wear contacts or glasses when you're over correcting trying to induce myopia. Either should work fine for that. But it sounds like you mostly wear contacts in doing this so your eyes are much more used to your contacts than they are to your glasses. Switching from contacts to glasses is often a problem even for wearing an actual prescription because your vision is slightly different with glasses than it is with contacts. Even worse in your case because your wearing glasses and contacts much stronger than you need. That "fishbowl" effect you see with your glasses is caused by the shape of your lenses. Take a pair of your weaker glasses and close your eyes and wipe them as if you were cleaning them. Now do the same with your stronger glasses. besides the lenses of your stronger glasses being thicker did you notice that they have a much more noticeable curve on the inside of the lens? That curve is what your eyes are seeing and giving you that fishbowl effect. You just need to start wearing your glasses more and not your contacts. That fishbowl feeling will soon go away. </p><p>I assume that you'r going to continue wearing over correction hoping that your eyes will soon give in to looking through so much over correction and changing. You can only hope that you didn't wait too long with deciding that you want to induce myopia. MROP is 19 so 4 years younger than you and her eyes didn't seem to have any problem with becoming myopic rather quickly and easily. But worse case if you're unable to induce any myopia you can still continue to wear glasses stronger than you need since your eyes seem okay with that. But the sadly the other part of you dream was having your eyesight blurry enough that you could take off your glasses and look at the world through your blurry eyes. kind of like being in your own little blurry world. But you would still have a few minutes while your eyes refocus to look into that blurry world before your natural vision returns.Also sine you're already used to doing GOC you could always do a version of that to get the blur that you want. If you wore +1.25 contacts without any glasses your vision would be at about -1.75 / -2.00 including you real prescription. Then instead of only wearing -1.75/ -2.00 glasses wear over correction of maybe -3.50 Kind of like when you were in high school. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2018, 10:41</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p> </p><p>He had to make a few adjustments which was fine!  </p><p> </p><p>Ive been getting headahes yes but as mentioned, my doctor put this down to stress rather than my eyes!

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Mar 2018, 09:59</p><p>MROP </p><p>I had a feeling that you would enjoy getting your glasses fitted for you. Did the optician have to make several adjustments to your glasses to get them totally comfortable on you? Did you enjoy all the way the optician was gently removing and replacing your glasses as he or she was making adjustments to your glasses? If you enjoyed getting your glasses fitted you know yo u can always take any of your glasses that you have gotten on line and have them adjusted as well. But of course you need to take them to a different optical store that don't know you. You can always do that. They don't care that your glasses didn't come from their store. That way all of your over correcting glasses will fit you nicely as well. There is no real rush with getting back to  over correcting you have 12 weeks before you go back for a recheck of your eyes. So for at least a week or so you should continue to enjoy wearing your actual prescription so your eyes can get fully adjusted to the astigmatism correct in  your glasses since that is all new to you. Once you start back wearing over correction I really don't think it is going to be that hard to get your eyes closer to the -2.00 you want them to be at. If you include your astigmatisms vision you're already pretty close to that now. So far your eyes have been very cooperative with inducing myopia so I see no reason why in 3 months with you continuing to wear over correction you should easily need an increase of about -.50 or -.75 added to your glasses. I'm sure that you love the way your new glasses feel and you're totally enjoying wearing them. So I agree when you do start over correcting wearing contacts under your glasses is a great way to do it so you can continue wearing your glasses.Are you still planning on ordering a pair of glasses with stronger SPH but adding your real CYL and axis numbers? </p><p>I wouldn't think that being off by 3 millimeters on your PD would have caused you to need astigmatism correction. Since you first started wearing glasses last fall have you been getting frequent headaches? I would think that your need need for astigmatism correction being as much as it is would have caused you get headaches quite often since your glasses of course didn't have any astigmatism correction in them. Now that you have glasses with astigmatism correction included having your glasses off for more than a few minutes will almost certainly bring on a headache now. I always wonder when people come in this tread and they say how much they want to wear glasses, real glasses not "fake" glasses that you can buy at the boutiques how much thought they have put into it. In my chats with both you and "denden" you both seemed to have carefully thought a lot about your decisions to want to induce myopia. Unlike many you both had a very reasonable for a prescription you wanted to be wearing as your full time glasses. That alone told me that you both were really serious and totally understood that the result would mean that your eyesight would no longer be perfect except with glasses or contacts. So i'm sure that you're truly happy with your eyes being less than perfect now and you don't have any regrets. Your able to see perfect with your glasses and that's really all that matters when you think about it.     </p><p>                                                </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Mar 2018, 09:11</p><p>MROP </p><p>Did you enjoy the experience of getting your glasses fitted when you picked them up? I'm glad your eyes were able to adjust to them in such a short time. Always interesting how adjusting to astigmatism correction can make you feel. But lucky for you that you were only a little bit dizzy at first. Once your eyes adjust they don't have the problem again which is strange as well. It has to feel odd for you to be wearing glasses that your eyes actually need now even though they are considerably weaker than the glasses you have been wearing for the past few months. I'm glad that you intend to continue wearing over correction to make your eyes a bit more nearsighted. You really need to do that because you little old optometrists is fully expecting that when you return in 3 months your going to need your glasses changed a bit. Remember he assumes that your eyes changed naturally due to either your genes or maybe the added strain from extra reading and studying at college. He doesn't know that you worked hard to make your eyes see less than perfect by wearing over correction. If you were to stop over correcting now I doubt that your eyes would change at all in the next 3 months which would really confuse your doctor. So i'm sure that your really enjoying wearing glasses that are really your prescription now. But after a week or so you need to get back to over correcting so you will need maybe an increase of about -.50 or -.75 in your glasses. The reason he made it 3 months is because most optical stores now have a policy that if your prescription changes within 90 days they will change the lenses in you glasses at no charge to you. That will make your glasses right at -2.00ish which if I recall is about where you said early on is the glasses you would want to be wearing as your everyday glasses.  </p><p>you were off slightly with measuring your PD so I don't know if that would be enough to have any effect on your astigmatisms or not. I honestly don't think so, but I could be wrong. Kind of nice that when you take your glasses off now things are blurry and they stay blurry. Are you going to miss not having perfect vision anymore?    </p><p></p><hr>

Now today the thrill will continue when you go to pickup your glasses. An optician or optical assistant will have you try on your glasses and ask you how they feel. You will tell him or her and they will do a fitting for you so your glasses are completely comfortable on you. Their going to check how they fit across your nose and behind your ears. They will make sure the earpieces rest comfortably behind your ears  not too tight but not too loose either. They will ask you how your vision is with your glasses. I know that you're going to enjoy all the attention with getting your glasses fitted.  </p><p>Be sure to ask what your PD measurement is so you can order glasses on line kn owing it is right. I look forward to hearing how you feel wearing your first glasses in your real prescription. I know you can't wait to put them on.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2018, 05:16</p><p>Does anyone feel like overcorrection is easier to adjust to with contact lenses compared to glasses with the same prescription? With glasses I get headaches due to the fisheye effect I mentioned earlier and feel a natural urge to remove something that is making my vision worse. Not to mention I lie down a lot when I'm relaxing at home, it's actually my default position when I'm not doing work. With contacts I need about 5 minutes to adjust and then I almost forget their existence! </p><p> </p><p>I would love to just overcorrect with contacts all the time but I do want to wear glasses too sometimes + my optometrist recently told me that I've been overwearing my contacts and that I should not keep them on for longer than 8 hours. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2018, 04:54</p><p>MROP, </p><p> </p><p>Sounds like you always had some astigmatism but you never got it prescribed until now. A friend of mine recently discovered he had -1.00 astigmatism in both eyes in addition to -0.50 and -0.75 myopia. He wasn't prescribed CYL lenses until his last eye test because he didn't suffer from blurry distance vision as much. His astigmatism became more noticeable when his myopia went up. </p><p> </p><p>Have you told your family that you've been prescribed glasses? I remember you were worried about how they would take it. Also, are you considering to use toric lenses when you wear contacts from now on? Your astigmatism is significant enough to warrant toric lenses. </p><p> </p><p>At what prescription are you planning to stop inducing? Will you wear your glasses full-time or part-time once you attain the amount of myopia you desire? Sorry for all the questions, I'm just really excited by your success!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;26 Mar 2018, 00:35</p><p>Soundmanpt  </p><p> </p><p>I was shocked when there was a few lines I couldnt read yes! And it was great to have him switch the lenses until I eventually could. Ive picked out some really nice rounded frames and go to collect them later today!  </p><p> </p><p>With the astigmatism, Ive noticed that my left eye gets ridiculously tired very easily. When this happens I can struggle to see at all distances with it. I mean I can still see but not as clearly and it does take an effort, I often find myself straining. The right eye is noticeably better but this does get tired too and the same things happens, it just seems to take a little longer. Ive been getting headaches generally for years,but my doctor put it down to stress (of uni/schoolwork). Thinking about it, they were probably my astigmatisms playing up, as the optician said theyve likely been there for a while and just got worse recently. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2018, 14:31</p><p>denden </p><p>Very true. What you're doing is certainly a better option than smoking. But at least you weren't smoking all that much anyway.  </p><p>i'm sure yo must have been disappointed that your eyesight was crystal clear wearing your actual prescription. I figured while you were wearing your real prescription you would be testing your eyes looking and hoping for some change in your vision. But for now you should continue trying for a while longer anyway. Your eyes just aren't wanting to cooperate are they? But at the same time they seem fine with be over corrected and you seem to see fine wearing stronger glasses and contacts which would seem like they would weaken your eyes by now. You and MROP both seemed to be progressing about the same with inducing myopia. She even lost several weeks when she went home and wasn't able to wear over correction as much as she had been. But her eyes cooperated even better than I think she expected. I knew she was going to get a prescription when she said that she couldn't see to drive at night anymore without glasses or contacts. That was a clear sign that her perfect vision was gone and she was starting to get nearsighted. Honestly i though she was going to be prescribed with about -.75 or maybe even -1.00 glasses as her first prescription. But she was slightly more nearsighted than that even and somehow she developed a decent amount of astigmatism to go along with it. i'm not sure how that happened. I wonder if she maybe was off with her PD measurement which caused it? I hope when she goes to pickup her glasses and get them fitted that she thinks to ask what her PD number is.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2018, 11:04</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Obviously it's not ideal to put anything other than clean air into your lungs but the risks of smoking are greatly reduced if one switches to vaping. I've noticed improvements  in my endurance and overall mood since I switched so I think it's working. </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately my real prescription contacts were giving me crystal clear vision. I don't think my myopia has progressed since I started this. It was somewhat demoralising but I will persist. That DNA test I mentioned also found a gene variant that is associated with a higher incidence of myopia so my genes may still allow an increase in my prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2018, 10:24</p><p>denden </p><p>Glad to hear that your taking care of your health. it sounds like your DNA results were really pretty good except for the Macular Degeneration part. But doesn't everybody have some of that as we go from birth to being an adult? I'm not a smoker and never have been so I am glad to hear that your stopping that.But haven't they found that vaping isn't all that good for you either? But 3 or 4 times a week isn't very often but maybe try and get that down to zero.  </p><p>I saw your comment back on March 23rd and I am glad that your interview went well. Fingers crossed that you get the job. If you don't get it i'm sure it was because you didn't wear glasses to your interview. haha Just kidding. No if you weren't feeling well and were already dizzy you did the right thing by only wearing contacts in your real prescription. It's a bit of a set back but necessary and you have been doing really well with constantly wearing over correction either with your glasses or contacts that one day shouldn't slow things down too much. While you were wearing your actual prescription how was your eyesight? Did you feel like signs and things were a bit blurry at a distance or did your eyesight seem to be perfect with your contacts?   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;25 Mar 2018, 04:56</p><p>Guys, I might have told you that I got this DNA test done. Turns out that I don't carry the genes for any diseases they screened me for... except Macular Degeneration :( Now I'm trying to be more myopic but I definitely don't want to be blind or have impaired vision that cannot be corrected with lenses. I'm trying to be diligent with my lifestyle choices; I eat healthy and recently replaced smoking with vaping (which I was only doing 3-4 times a week anyway but I'm trying to reduce any risk factors). Really hope I don't get this.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;24 Mar 2018, 08:57</p><p>MROP </p><p>I'm sure that this wasn't the first time you have had your eyes examined but i'm sure this time was the most enjoyable time ever when you were unable to read the bottom half of the eyechart. Were you surprised that your eyesight was really that blurry? But at least you knew then that you would for sure be getting a prescription for glasses. Very good that you remembered to tell the doctor all your issues with were having with your eyes. Things like not seeing as well when driving at night which of course as you now know you weren't able to see much better during the day driving either. Were you surprised that he wants to re-examine your eyes in 3 months time? Your eyesight isn't by any means terrible but for what he believes to be your first prescription it's a bit stronger than what most would get as their first prescription. So i'm sure he feels like he is under correcting you now for your first glasses. And he is right in thinking that way  because if in fact these were really your first glasses your eyes really wouldn't have been relaxed enough to refract your eyes fully. So that bis also why he things that your your eyes are going to change more in the coming months after your eyes have fully adjusted to your glasses. In normal natural cases that would be the case. But he doesn't realize that the only reason you need glasses now is because you have been wearing over correction for several months or your eyesight would still be perfect. If you were to only wear the glasses he prescribed to you chances are in the coming 3 months there would be no change in your vision at all. Which i'm sure would be a surprise to your doctor  because i'm sure he fully expects that your going to need somewhere around a -.75 to -1.00 increase in your glasses in 3 month's time. So probably a good idea that you're planning on continuing to wear over correction to induce a little more myopia. So in 3   months it's very possible that your new prescription will be R -1.75 -.75 / L -2.00 -1.00. Isn't that about where you want your eyes to be when you stop inducing?  </p><p>Just curious about your astigmatisms. I know that you have been doing really well with either wearing your glasses or contacts constantly but have you noticed any change in your near vision when you aren't wearing your glasses or contacts? I mean has your ability to read things like a book changed any since you started wearing over correction? In other words is it more difficult now to read a book than before? Also have you been getting more headaches than you used? I am asking these questions because those are things tat usually go along with having astigmatisms. I'm sure that you know having astigmatisms effects your eyesight at all distances.  </p><p>It had to fun being able to sit down and try on all the glasses in the store. So i'm sure you can't wait to get your glasses so you can enjoy seeing the world through your real very own glasses with your real necessary prescription in them. What style of glasses did you select?    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2018, 22:58</p><p>I forgot to add that I did order some glasses with my real prescription and Im picki them up in a few days time. Meanwhile its back to the -5.90 for m!! </p><p> </p><p>I figured I had some astigmatism but was shocked by how much. The optician said hes shocked how Ive got by with concentrating on tasks for so long without correction for it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2018, 21:22</p><p>MROP </p><p> I forgot to mention that the difference between sphere, and cylinder power is quite different. </p><p> A smaller amount of astigmatism contributes to a larger amount of blur, than the same value of sphere would.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2018, 21:13</p><p>MROP </p><p> Congrats. Great FIRST Rx. </p><p> Most Optometrists are taught that when the astigmatism in the better eye reaches -.75, that full time wear is required.       Most first time cylinder prescriptions are -.25, or -.50.  </p><p> As others have said, it is sometimes difficult adjusting to a new astigmatic correction, but your eyes are quite astigmatic, so you need to persevere with the glasses. </p><p> It is quite possible that your future cylinder correction will exceed your sphere.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2018, 20:40</p><p>I really enjoyed getting my eyes examined and it was quite exciting not being able to read the bottom half of the chart. The optician was very old and listened to all of my needs. He also said I should go back in a few months as he expects my prescription to go up a fair bit (exciting!!!) in the next two years or so before calming down and averaging out so Ive re-booked in for 3 months time, just to check up.  </p><p> </p><p>Im going to continue to wear over correction and aim at inducing a little more myopia but not too much more.  </p><p> </p><p>Picking out my glasses in an actual shop where people knew I needed them was amazing rather from my own home. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2018, 16:08</p><p>MROP </p><p>YEAH! I too want to congratulate on the results of you eye exam. I'm sure you must be excited as well. Your hard work has really paid off. Not only are your eyes nearsighted but you even managed to develop a nice amount of astigmatism as well. How hard was it for you not to start jumping up and down when the bottom half of the eyechart was too blurry for you to see? You had to know then that you were going to get the prescription you have been working so hard for. So if you figure half the value of your astigmatism correction to your SPH correction you're eyes are really at Right eye -1.50 and Left eye -1.75. So isn't that about where you wanted to be at for your glasses? When you get your glasses and they have your astigmatism correction in them it may take you a short time for your eyes to adjust and you may feel like the floor is slanted and you may even feel a bit dizzy as well. But once your eyes adjust you''re going to see even better than you are now with you over correcting glasses. So are planning on ordering your new glasses in your actual prescription now that you really do need to be wearing glasses. Were you surprised that you were told to wear your glasses for the next few weeks so your eyes could adjust to the astigmatisms? What he was really telling you was that you need to wear your glasses full time now because it should only take a day or so for your eye to adjust if that long even. But he knows that if you wear your glasses for a few weeks your eye are going to get used to them and you probably would just continue wearing them full time anyway. Also by being told by a doctor that you now must wear your glasses whenever you drive it means that your now  required to wear your glasses when driving even though it is marked on your drivers license yet. So when you being told all this how hard was it for you to not be smiling widely?  </p><p>It's a good thing that you're planning on only wearing glasses full time because if you want contacts you're astigmatisms are bad enough that you would need toric lenses which are special contacts that are weighted so they don't spin around on your eyes like your current contacts do. But they also cost about 3 or 4 times more than the contacts you have now. Your glasses are much cheaper and they don't charge any extra for astigmatism correction. Please try and tell us how you felt as you were getting your eyes examined and when you knew that you were going to be getting glasses.  </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2018, 11:13</p><p>MROP, </p><p> </p><p>Congratulations!! Your hard work finally paid off. I've been absent because I was insanely busy but I had my interview today. I think it went well. Btw I ended up wearing my real prescription contacts (-0.50 -0.75) sorry Soundmanpt! I know it's bad that I missed out on one day of overcorrection but I was feeling really dizzy that morning and didn't want to risk making it worse with overcorrecting lenses. Hope it didn't ruin the progress I made so far.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2018, 18:29</p><p>MROP </p><p> I hope that this is not the case, but ghosting above lights as you describe it could also indicate glaucoma. Myopia, and glaucoma often go hand in hand.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2018, 16:02</p><p>MROP </p><p>Yes of course it is possible that you might be starting to developing some astigmatism in your eyes. I honestly can't say if wearing strong glasses and contacts are the reason or not. But we know that myopia is caused by the lengthening of the eyes which is what your attempting to do by wearing strong glasses. So in changing the length it would seem you're changing the shape as well which might bring on some astigmatisms as well. But it could be the ghosting is just part of your eyes becoming weaker and when your tired it's harder for your eyes to stay focused anymore without your glasses. I assume that you only get the ghosting when your not wearing your glasses or contacts? With your glasses or contacts no ghosting problem right?  I'm sure it's at least related to your wearing over correction in some way. I guess you will find out on Friday. Be sure to mention to the doctor about the ghosting your getting and any other vision problems you are having. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>astigmaphile</b>&nbsp;20 Mar 2018, 10:17</p><p>MROP, </p><p>Find an online astigmatism test. That should help you determine if you are astigmatic or not. More detail would have to come from an eye exam.</p><p></p><hr>

So even though it has been pushed back several times now it really just gives you more time to be wearing over correction which should be slowly weakening your eyes a little each day. Do you feel like your going to be happy with the results of your eye exam on Friday?  </p><p>Sounds like you found the glasses you want to wear as your full time glasses when you get a prescription on Friday.  </p><p></p><hr>

Its funnt as this pair is the first pair that Ive noticed the same thing as Denden, some things appear to be spherical!

It will give you a lot of pleasure and whilst you may never return to sight you had the warnings given in good faith may not come about. Each person is different. In my case I have done goc to -20 and used base out to10 over many years and can still have an eye test and only need part time wear. </p><p> </p><p>Food for thought but wish you well.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2018, 22:35</p><p>WantMyos </p><p>Glad to hear form you again. The main thing not only with you but with everyone else in here is for them to fully understand what they are doing when they are doing GOC or trying to induce myopia or if they are wanting to go even further with things such as strabismus. These are big decisions and should be thought out before doing anything. It's doubtful that your going to be able to induce enough myopia to the point where you will ever need myodiscs except with the use of GOC. But you should still be able to induce enough myopia to cause your vision to be pretty blurry without glasses. It takes far less time for your eyes to become very dependent on your glasses when you include prisms in your glasses. Apparently you are already seeing the results of wearing prisms if your starting to see double already. The only one that needs to be happy with your decision to ruin your eyes is you and if your happy that is the main thing. Just remember their is no do over now. Your going to be wearing glasses and only glasses from now until you die. Please continue to give updates as to your progress. What prescription were you given at your eye exam? I assume that you went for your eye exam bare eyed?      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2018, 07:39</p><p>denden </p><p>I have a feeling that you will do well with any interviews you do. You seem like you're on top of things pretty well and determined about the things you want from life. You clearly think things through. So wearing glasses to interviews will just be that little extra for you to show your professional look.  </p><p>I will be looking forward to your return to this forum but you're right in wanting get other things taken care of with your life besides working so hard in making yourself more nearsighted. And by continuing to wear over correction and doing even more reading and close work should help with that as well. I will look forward to hearing of any changes you may notice with your eyes in the coming days and weeks. I of course wish you the best with everything and take care.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>WantMyos</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2018, 07:34</p><p>Hello gang, </p><p>I am back with an update that may upset a few of you. I went through with GOC, but still really wanted to induce some myopia, so i decided I would go through with inducing myopia, and then maybe start GOC after I get to how much myopia I want, I am also inducing strabismus, I could not resist. I really want prism glasses, but more than that I want to see double just as I want to see  blurry images and want to really need my glasses to help me see clear. </p><p>I know a few of you talked against inducing strabismus, and I tried, but I could not stay away. This is something I really want.  </p><p>Anyways, the reason for the update, I had my regular appointment with the family eye doctor and I am ecstatic to say, my prescription has gone up!!! Also, after doing a long test where the doctor kept covering and uncovering my eyes and then covering and uncovering one eye with a stick if prisms infront of the other eye she told me that I did have problems with both of my eyes working together, and that it was causing the double vision!!!!! </p><p>I cannot express how great that felt. It was seriously a dream come true!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2018, 07:18</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for the advice! I will wear my glasses to the interview. I'm not the superstitious kind but I can think of it as my lucky charm haha.  </p><p> </p><p>I will be taking some time off this forum because I have way too many things going on at the moment. I'm trying to get my life back in order regarding my education, job prospects and overall health. I procrastinate too much so I need to minimise distractions. </p><p> </p><p>Don't worry; I am still wearing my overcorrection religiously! I am hoping that extended hours of studying I am about to do will aid me even further. I will keep you updated if anything important happens.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2018, 10:36</p><p>denden </p><p>Your new glasses sound really cute and i'm sure you look very attractive wearing them. Sometimes going away from your comfort zone opens your eyes to something new and exciting. Going with black or tortoise is often the safe choice for getting glasses because they go with everything but other choices can work well too.  </p><p>If you're not going home for a month then go ahead and start wearing your glasses so your eyes can continue to adjust to them. Wearing contacts for the week that you're going to be home shouldn't be a problem by then with going back to your glasses. I don't think in that short of time of not wearing your glasses will cause you much if any problem readjusting to your glasses. Now if you were able to wear your contacts during then day while at home and switch to your glasses at night before going to bed then you for sure wouldn't have any adjusting to worry about. But i'm sure that's not possible and you really don't want any unnecessary conflict with your mom about your wearing glasses. When you were in high school and doing GOC your glasses were weaker and you probably weren't wearing your contacts full time like you are now. </p><p>You have several options really. But there have been studies done which proves that wearing glasses is an advantage over those not wearing glasses when all other things are equal. So without a doubt you should be wearing glasses for any job interview you go on. Now it is up to you which glasses you want to wear. You haven't said exactly what your other glasses look like but I assume they might be black or tortoise. If you feel like you look more professional wearing glasses like that then why not wear a pair of your extended contacts along with those glasses. But if you think you look just as nice and professional wearing your new blue glasses then wear them. Either way as long as your wearing glasses I don't think it will make any difference what color they are to the person doing the interview. You're for sure going to look smarter wearing glasses.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2018, 09:12</p><p>denden </p><p>I'm sure you probably used the right PD and even being slightly off wouldn't cause that. I have heard this same complaint from people that are wearing their actual prescription. What your eyes are seeing is the difference between seeing with contacts and glasses. I can't explain it but it's the difference between having lenses sitting on your corneas and glasses sitting slightly in front of you eyes. Their seeing the inside curvature of the lenses of your glasses. You just didn't get the same effect from your weaker glasses because the curvature wasn't as much. Your eyes just need to adjust to your glasses. But if going home soon and your not going to be able to wear your glasses anyway then i would suggest that you just continue wearing your extended wear contacts with and without your weaker glasses until you get back from your visit home. No point making your eyes have to adjust 2 times to your glasses. Otherwise are yo happy with the way your new glasses look? I know you didn't like the first pair you got and you returned them for this pair.   </p><p></p><hr>

Is this how people with higher prescriptions see, or is it because they are overly minused for my eyes? Or could it be that I measured my PD wrong?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Liam</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2018, 06:26</p><p>Jared, I am studying hard for some exams and really pushing my eyes to read close up. It is easier this week  but still a strain at times. I am holding my written work as close as I can. Distance is now fine with the -22 glasses, I think all the close work has helped in that respect.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jared</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2018, 17:23</p><p>Liam </p><p> </p><p>Hi. Just wondering how you were doing with your -22's. Has reading and close work improved?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2018, 12:08</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>I was doing GOC in 9th grade, so when I was 15-16. When my mom found my contacts I said they were minus lenses of course. She is also against the idea of wearing correction, even in the form of contacts. I don't think I can change her opinions so my solution is to refrain from putting my specs on around her if I can avoid it. </p><p> </p><p>Haha nice try with the guy in high school but we never kissed. He was quite good looking so I wouldn't have minded it back then, but no. He just seemed to understand optics well. I had a highly hyperopic friend (R +3.50 L +5.50) and he kept saying that her glasses had a magnifying effect. He was correct but this made her self-conscious as plus lenses are often associated with old people. He also often changed his frames and frequently switched between glasses and contacts. Nowadays I think he's wearing contacts only.  </p><p> </p><p>He was standing a talking distance from me when he noticed my contacts, around half a meter I'd say. I'm not surprised that he noticed them because I can also spot them quite well. In particular, if I meet someone for the first time, I tend to pay close attention to their eyes. Eyes are the windows to the soul, as the old adage goes, you can learn so many things about someone just by looking at their eyes. Among other things (ability to maintain eye contact, wrinkles around eyes, dark circles, the shape and colour) I also pay attention to whether they need correction to see clearly. I'm a highly attentive person and I can remember many details about the people I've met. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2018, 09:54</p><p>daffy </p><p>I totally get your point and you're right if they are just wanting to be able to wear the strongest glasses possible but their eyes can see close up with such strong glasses then the idea of bifocals is the answer for them. But if they are trying to induce myopia then they need their glasses to feel too strong for seeing close up. The more they are forcing their eyes to read small print the harder their eyes are working to focus. This is a big asset in helping them induce myopia. If their eyes are completely comfortable with reading small print then they need to change to stronger glasses.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daffy</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2018, 05:04</p><p>Of all the people that complain that they can't see close with their over correction for distance, why not just get bifocals or multifocals and live happily ever after?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2018, 17:20</p><p>denden </p><p>Well i'm happy to be back. What a pain! I have been busy with moving furniture back and forth since last Tuesday morning. Now my friend just came and hooked up my computer for me.  </p><p>Probably getting the "EyeQue" would be a good ides for you as well MROP and kiki to keep track of your progress. Here in the US insurance will only pay for one eye exam a year out of pocket an eye exam can cost around $75.00 $80.00 depending where you go. From reports I have seen it seems to work pretty well.  It must work since it came out they have raised the price of it slightly.  </p><p>Not surprising, you're already ahead of me again by wearing a stronger contact on your better eye to try a weaken it a bit more. That should start to help I would think. You want it to be about as blurry as your other eye is.  </p><p>So what year of high school were you in when you started wearing glasses and then glasses and contacts? When your mom found your contact lens case what did you say when she asked you about it? i'm sure that you didn't tell her that your were doing GOC? You should have just said that a friend let you try a pair of contacts just to see if you liked them or not so you maybe start wearing contacts instead of glasses. Since she didn't like seeing you wearing glasses she might have gone along on that idea. You're mom is old school. Back in her day when she was your age it was still sort of a kiss of death for a young girl to start wearing glasses because the chances of that girl finding her prince charming was pretty much out the window because of her less than perfect eyesight. But as you know, it's a much different world now nearly everyone wears glasses, or contacts, now. Many men prefer the young glasses wearing ladies now because they are not only attractive but also appear smarter as well. But I agree with you for now any visits home there is no point point in causing any problems about your wearing glasses or not. You can save that battle for when you start wearing your glasses full time. You're still in school so you blame all the extra studying on your need for wearing glasses full time. She won't like it but as you say there isn't much she can do about it. After all your not a teenager anymore, your an adult.  </p><p>That boy that spotted the fact that your were wearing contacts back in high school, how close did he get to you to see the rings of your contacts? Have you ever tried to spot people wearing contacts? It's really hard and you usually have get extremely close in order to see them. So either this guy was in love with your eyes that he was looking so hard at them or he was "kissing " close and you kept your eyes open. Whenever possible if you're afraid of that ever happening again you should try and come up with a nice strong combination of glasses and contacts. If your wearing glasses it makes it even more difficult to see contacts in your eyes.      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2018, 16:32</p><p>Kiki </p><p>Honestly I think it is nearly impossible to do much fooling of an optometrists and really what doe that really do anyway? You're already "cheating" by wearing wearing -4.50 / -4.75 glasses that you don't seem to have any real need for. You're better off just getting your eyes checked when you think there has been some change in your eyesight. If you still feel like your eyesight is perfect without glasses I don't see nay point in getting your eyes rested now.  </p><p>When you have done your closing one eye at a time test while driving were you wearing your glasses or was this without your glasses? I'm not sure sure why things are blurry with just one eye at time being open, but not blurry with both eyes open. For some reason your eyes aren't able to focus independently. it has to mean wearing over correction is having some effect on your eyes. How bad is the blur? I mean is it maybe about -2.00 or worse?    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;10 Mar 2018, 19:32</p><p>spartoo, </p><p>If you are approaching 40, it is likely that Presbyopia is creeping up on you.  Prism will not help that. </p><p>What is happening to you, as it has with billions and billions before you, is that the focusing mechanism in your eyes is aging also.  The primary problem is that the variable focus lenses in your eyes are getting stiff and very hard for your focusing muscles to change their power.  By the way, this stiffening action has been occurring for probably the last 30 years, but it is just now becoming a nuisance.  The bad news is that it will get worse. The good news is that there is a limit to how bad it will get. </p><p>What WILL help you are some reading glasses either in the form of Over-the-Counter (OTC) Reading Glasses or if appropriate, prescription bifocals.  Many stores sell OTC Reading Glasses.  I suggest starting with the lowest power they offer (usually +1.00 or +1.25) and see how those help. </p><p>If you have not had one recently, you should also consider an eye exam. The eyes are windows into the body and often silent health problems are detected during an eye exam that have no direct effect on vision. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kiki</b>&nbsp;07 Mar 2018, 12:32</p><p>I couldnt fall asleep last night and my mind wandered to the possibilities of cheating on an eye exam. So for myself when I close one eye I can make it very blurry but I cannot do them simultaneously. I am wondering if the autorefractor would indicate a prescription. I wish I had about $5000 to buy one to play with. Another random thought.. I wear -4.50 and -4.75 but do not require glasses at all. How come when Im driving I can close one eye and its blurry and I can close the other eye with the same result but with both eyes open the blur is gone?</p><p></p><hr>

Hope your carpet renewal goes well. </p><p> </p><p>My right eye is -0.50 more myopic than my left eye. Until recently I was wearing -2.75 on my right eye -2.50 on my left eye. However, I switched to wearing -2.50 in both because it simplified things (less thinking to do in the morning before I'm sufficiently caffeinated, can wear my glasses over when studying alone). I've used up all my -2.50 dailies now and I'm moving on to my -2.75 contacts. Therefore, my left eye is more overcorrected than my right eye nowadays. </p><p> </p><p>I wore my glasses around them in high school sometimes but they kept telling me that I looked bad in them and told me off for wearing them while studying, as I didn't need them for near vision.  </p><p> </p><p>Back in high school, I pulled off wearing lenses well but my mom eventually found my contact lens case. She got really mad ofc but now even if she learned I wear them it's not like she can stop me. Still I want to minimise unpleasant interactions as much as possible during my holiday back home. </p><p> </p><p>I guess I care about glasses/contacts much more than the average person lol Still wouldn't fellow contact wearers be able to see the rings around my iris? As I told you before, one guy in high school also saw them in my eyes once.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Liam</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2018, 14:24</p><p>Ben, keep on those -10.0D glasses. Yes you would love to take them off but don't do so even for a minute. You are forcing your eyes to adjust to them. Now the worse bit, try to read print held as close as possible. It will be a strain at first but over time your eyes will adjust. You know how much you want to be myopic. </p><p>Remember first thing in the morning and last at night you must be looking through the glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2018, 12:37</p><p>deden </p><p>Oh I forgot to mention that if you were to find any glasses that you like in Zenni they are international and do ship to the UK In fact several years ago I helped a young lady order her glasses from Zenni and she lived in the UK. She got her glasses within 2 weeks mailed to her house. Shipping was either $5.00 or $8.00 I don't recall. You ay want to check them out. they have really cute glasses and their prices for a complete pair is as low as $6.95. Here is one that was only $6.95 that I got for a young lady at the local sports bar. #419114. She loves them by the way. Her prescription is about where you hope to be -1.75. She wears her glasses nearly all the time but she can still see well enough to do her job as a server without her glasses being on. Every once in a while she will put her glasses on her head and with some noticeable squinting she can do her job just fine. The one thing she can't see is when someone needs a fresh drink. So she has to up to the table to look. see works as a dental assistant so she keeps her glasses on at her day job all the time not only so she can see but to keep patients spit from getting in her eyes. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2018, 12:25</p><p>denden </p><p>I just a call from the carpet people and they were coming out next Wednesday to install my new carpeting. But the carpet came in early and they are now coming out tomorrow. So will be shutting down my computer in a short time and it will be down for a few days until i can get it back on line. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2018, 12:21</p><p>denden </p><p>Like I said, you have clearly researched everything pretty well. Because of your doing GOC in high school you are well aware of what your eyesight will be if you can get up to -1.50  to -2.00. And you even know what your glasses will look like as well. You're right, your glasses are going to have some power rings and just enough cut-in that your glasses aren't going to look like "planos' or fake glasses. And at the same time your eyes shouldn't look any smaller behind your glasses.You don't in anyway sound vain. You just sound like a young woman that knows exactly what she wants. I kinda think working in the world of finance you would almost be expected to either already be wearing glasses when you start or soon be needing glasses after a short time anyway. I'm sure that you have already thought of that as well.  </p><p>I assumed that you have probably been testing your eyes every so often to see if there has been any change. It sounds like the over correcting is having some effect on your eyes if things are starting to be more blurred. Not sure why your right eye is significantly more blurry than your left eye. Which eye are you wearing the stronger contact on? If you're wearing the stronger contact on your right eye try switching it and wear the stronger contact on your left eye to push it a bit more. See if that helps.  </p><p>So going home for week all you can do is continue wearing your extended wear contacts all the time. Even though your parents are anti-glasses didn't you wear glasses in high school? I mean besides when you were doing GOC but didn't you have a very weak prescription as well. You recently had the prescription changed in your old actual prescription glasses and sunglasses to -1.25 / -.75  -.50  170 didn't you? So wouldn't you be okay wearing those glasses around your parents without any questions being asked? You have become a 00 so i'm sure that you notice other people wearing glasses and contacts much more than the average person does. </p><p>I was curious when you were in high school how you managed to do GOC assuming that you were likely still living at home. But I just figured that by having an actual weak prescription all you needed to do was hide your contact lens cleaner and things from your parents.Did you ever come close to getting caught back then?       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2018, 10:55</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>My -1.50/-2.00 glasses have just enough power rings and cut ins to make it obvious that my glasses aren't plano. My eyes appear pretty much the same size which I like. Sorry if I sound vain, but as a young woman aspiring to work in finance, I have to care about these things. </p><p> </p><p>Not sure if Zenni delivers to the UK at all, I just use UK based websites such as selectspecs.com. I'm not really worried about my partner trying my glasses on anymore. The last time he put them on (the R -0.75 L -0.25 -0.50 pair) they gave him a terrible headache so he's been put off doing that since. If he does and asks me why the lenses are so strong I will just say that they feel that way because the frames are bigger.  </p><p> </p><p>Each night, after taking out my contacts, I look outside the window to see how blurry my vision is before going to bed. I am starting to see some blur, although my right eye is significantly more blurry. I just hope it's not only my right eye but both that are becoming more myopic. </p><p> </p><p>I scheduled a week-long holiday back home in April. As I might have mentioned before, my parents are anti-glasses. They see them as crutches that should be shunned unless they are necessary for survival. They nag me if I keep my glasses on around them and are dead against contacts as well. I'm thinking of keeping my Acuvue Oasys contacts on throughout my time back home. I used to wear my contacts around my parents in high school and got away with it. It's just that I'm so good at telling whether someone's wearing contacts (I can notice them even in a 10 second exchange because I maintain eye contact a lot with people). I'm always paranoid people can see them in my eyes when I don't want them to.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2018, 10:39</p><p>denden </p><p>I'm not at all surprised that you don't want your glasses to look strong or thick have thick lenses. I knew that by the prescription you want as your everyday glasses of -1.50 to -2.00. With a prescription in that range your glasses are going to look really nice and you lenses will be nice and thin. Your eyes will still look the same size with your glasses on as they do without glasses. You want to be just as attractive wearing glasses as you are without them. I honestly don't think you need to go with a higher index lens to keep your glasses looking normal. Over the years I have placed numerous orders for glasses and I have found that with Zenni up to around -4.50 the 1.56 free lens option works fine with still being on the thin side. Now as you know the bigger the frame them thicker the edges of your lenses are going to be. And semi-rimless and rim;less are going to show lens thickness much easier than a full plastic frame will. I actually just went into Zenni and put in fake order using -3.75 as the prescription. Zenni recommended the mid range high index lens which is 1.61. With Zenni that is an extra $19.00. It is really up to you. Personally if your main concern is your partner I don't think he will notice your glasses looking any stronger than the ones you just got. But even with the ones you just got if he ever tries your glasses on he is going to notice instantly that your glasses considerably stronger than the ones he had tried on before. If that ever happens all you can say is that all the extra studying has taken a toll on your eyes. But you just didn't want to say anything about it. I just hate to see you spend extra money if its not necessary. So a lot depends on how long you intend on wearing these glasses when you get them? Is this just another step before decide to get another increase? Or do you think this is as strong as you need to go to get your eyes to change? Since your late night super market run when you went without glasses or contacts. You said that things were noticeably more blurry than before. Have you tested your eyes to see how well you're able to see now without glasses or contacts?       </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2018, 09:56</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Fair enough, I will go for that prescription then. How thick would they be if I ordered lenses with 1.6 index? Unlike many people in this forum I don't really want my glasses to look that strong.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Mar 2018, 09:02</p><p>denden </p><p>Well i'm glad that your glasses finally arrived but too bad that you don't like frame. But it's just as important to how you look wearing your glasses as the prescription is. I'm sure you are intending to start wearing your glasses more often once you get glasses that you look good wearing all the time or most of the time anyway. As long as you have your contacts and are wearing them everyday you're not losing any down time from over correcting your eyes. Nice that your partner didn't even bother trying on your glasses. So you're probably safe to order your next glasses in whatever prescription that you think your eyes can tolerate wearing. So to answer your question about what prescription you should order your next glasses in I need to know how comfortable are you wearing either daily contacts along with your glasses and wearing your new contacts that are -3.50 / -3.25? If you're not having any problem wearing either of them then you should get your glasses at as strong as they are. No point in going with weaker  glasses than you're already comfortably wearing. When possible you always want your eyes feeling slightly stressed by having them over corrected. And remember your glasses to get even the same equal prescription should be slightly stringer than your contacts anyway. I would think maybe going with -3.75 / -3.25 -.50 170. Your lenses sholdn't be that much thicker than they are on the glasses you just got. Even better if you're planning on ordering a full plastic frame. A full plastic frame does a great job of hiding any thickness there might be.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;05 Mar 2018, 17:13</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>My glasses arrived today! I've got some good news and bad news. The good news is that my partner had no interest in trying them on. He barely noticed I had a different pair on tbh. The lensed also looked quite thin from outside. The bad news is that I hate my new frames lol. I'm returning them and ordering a home trial to make a more informed choice in frame. Also, knowing my partner won't try on my glasses, I can go ahead and order stronger glasses! I was considering R -3.00 L -2.50 -0.50 170. What do you think?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus jack</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2018, 11:13</p><p>Liam, </p><p>Effective and comfortable GOC starts with your actual complete prescription. </p><p>If you are naturally Myopic, that means that you have a + refractive error with your Crystalline Lenses fully Relaxed.  A GOC combo requires a CL with additional + to bring your refractive error up to about +20 to be able to wear -30 glasses.  However, Vertex Distance (VD) effects are even more massive with -30 glasses than they are with your -22 glasses. </p><p>-22 glasses have about 0,50 diopters per mm and -30 glasses have about 0.9 diopters per mm of VD effects. </p><p>Because of VD effects, the effective power of your -22 glasses is about -16 at your Cornea if your VD is 12 mm.  -30 glasses would have an effective power of about -19.2 at your Cornea with a VD of 12 mm. </p><p>Please do not attempt a GOC combo with these numbers they assume a refractive error or 0.00. Getting a high prescription GOC combo right is bad enough starting with an accurate prescription.  Starting with a guess is a very expensive exercise in frustration and discomfort. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;03 Mar 2018, 10:54</p><p>HOW TO STUDY FOR AN EYE EXAM </p><p>An eye exam is not like an exam that you might take in school and there is really no way to study for it. However, you can prepare for it and learn about your role in the exam. The best eye exams are a team effort between you and the Examiner (hereafter referred to as the Eye Care Professional or the ECP). Part of the preparation is to learn what to expect, particularly if this is your first eye exam. </p><p>One important thing you need to keep in mind is that the ECP, has no way to experience what you are seeing. The ECP has to depend on your answers to important questions. </p><p>There are two parts to an eye exam. </p><p>The first part is the Objective part. This part consists of: </p><p>1. Taking a Visual History where you describe your vision and the kinds of problems you are having. Please tell the ECP everything. In some ways the ECP must be a detective and every clue is important. </p><p>2. Checking the internal pressure in your eyes for symptoms of Glaucoma. This is one of the very few parts of an eye exam that is even mildly uncomfortable and the discomfort only lasts for a few seconds. There are two basic ways to do the pressure test. </p><p>A. Using a special instrument to lightly touch your Cornea. No real worry there. Before doing this type of test a drop of mild anesthetic will make sure you dont even feel it. </p><p>B. There is a new type instrument that uses a puff of air directed against your cornea. No anesthetic is required, but the puff will startle you. The puff of air is harmless. </p><p>There are huge benefits to these simple tests to detect Glaucoma early, before it can do damage. Early discovery can save your eyesight. </p><p>3. The ECP will also get a preliminary estimate of your refractive error by using an Auto- Refractor or manually by using a small hand held instrument called an Ophthalmoscope or Retinoscope. </p><p>The Auto-Refractor is a relatively new instrument that was developed in conjunction with NASA to check Astronauts vision in space. You just look into the machine with each eye individually or in some machines both eyes are checked at the same time. When you look into the machine, you will see a scene or a pattern. The machine will adjust its internal lenses to focus the image you see, on your Retina. The Auto-Refractor only takes a few seconds for each eye and it then prints out your estimated prescription. </p><p>Some ECPs prefer to use manual methods that have been used for many years. Using an Ophthalmoscope or Retinoscope and a Trial Lens set or a Phoropter (a fancy machine with a built in lens set), the ECP will look into your eyes and select the lenses that allow him/her to see your Retina, most clearly. </p><p>This first part of the exam was to get to a starting place for the Subjective part of the exam where you have to describe what you see. </p><p> The second part of the exam is the Subjective part: </p><p>Typically the Subjective part of the exam starts with the Right Eye shutter open and the Left Eye shutter closed. </p><p>Step 1 is typically determining the Cylinder and Axis of any Astigmatism correction you need. </p><p>This is actually the hardest part of the exam because you will be asked to judge relative blurriness of two images rather than the relative sharpness of two images, which follows. </p><p>You will be shown a line of text and a supplemental lens will be rotated into place. This lens is a cylinder lens that is mounted on a 45 degree pivot. It can be flipped back an forth to bracket a trial axis or orientation of the long Axis of the Cylinder lens. </p><p>The thing that is confusing about this test is that the straight lines (strokes) of the letters will alternate in clarity as the lens is flipped back and forth depending on the direction of the stroke. </p><p>I suggest concentrating on an O if possible. Depending on your answers, the ECP will adjust the axis knob unit the image you see is equally blurry with the supplemental lens 45 degrees each side of the selected axis. </p><p>At this point the ECP will probably swing the supplemental lens out of the way and may change the Cylinder power, while asking you which lens is shaper and clearer. </p><p>Fine Tuning the Axis </p><p>If you have not had many eye exams, you may be uncomfortable asking the ECP to let you fine tune the Cylinder Axis. It is often beneficial to mention that you would like to Fine Tune the Axis at the appropriate point in the exam, before the exam starts. I have found that most ECPs will appreciate your wanting to actively participate in the exam. </p><p>The way this works is that the ECP will place your hand on the Axis control knob. This time, you move it back and forth a few degrees looking for the sharpest image. It is a bit like Fine Tuning an old Analog TV set or moving the tuning knob on an analog AM radio for the best signal. As you move the knob, you may notice that the letters appear distorted (an uncorrected Astigmatism effect), all you have to do is stop moving the knob when the image looks the sharpest and has the proper shape. It is that simple. </p><p>The next step is determining the Sphere correction. </p><p>This is an easy part of the exam because all you have to do is pick the sharpest image, but there is a tricky part. Your auto-focus mechanism will try to help, if it gets a chance. The ECP has a couple of ways to minimize the action of your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses. </p><p>The ECP can sneak up on your Sphere prescription or the ECP can use drops to Dilate your eyes. Lets talk about sneaking up on your prescription first. </p><p>There are actually FOUR lenses* in your eyes lens system, but for our purposes we will only consider two of them, the Cornea and the Crystalline Lens. All of the lenses are PLUS lenses. </p><p> </p><p> The total relaxed power of all the lenses added together is typically about +56 to +60 diopters. The only VARIABLE focus lens is the Crystalline Lens. The rest of the lenses are FIXED or SEMI-FiXED power. The PLUS power of your Crystalline Lens is controlled by your Ciliary Muscles. For distance, your Crystalline Lenses should be fully relaxed with a power of somewhere around +15 diopters. When you focus to read, your Ciliary Muscles squeeze the Crystalline Lenses to increase their PLUS power by the amount necessary to sharply focus the image on your Retina. The amount of additional PLUS needed, depends on the distance to the object. Typically around +2.50, but it can be a bit more, depending on how close you like to read. (See Presbyopia, below) </p><p>This will take a little thought to get your mind around, but if you are nearsighted (Myopic), your lens system has too much PLUS for the distance from the lens system to your Retina and you need MINUS lenses to neutralize some of that excess PLUS power. You ONLY have the ability to increase the PLUS power of your lens system. You have NO ability to reduce the PLUS power of your Crystalline lenses to LESS than that in the fully relaxed condition. (That is why people who are Myopic need external correction). </p><p>If you are farsighted (fHyperopic), your lens system does not have enough PLUS for the distance from the lens system to your Retina and you need PLUS lenses to focus images on your Retina. If Presbyopia does not prevent it, you have some ability to correct Hyperopia, internally. </p><p>To try to keep your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline lenses from getting in the act, the ECP will start with NOT ENOUGH MINUS or TOO MUCH PLUS (optically. the same thing) and gradually increase the MINUS or decrease the PLUS, one or two steps at a time, while reducing the size of the line you are asked to read. ECP will not tell you what power lens or what line you are looking at. Eventually, ECP will reach the 20/20 line and a lens power that lets you read it with no mistakes. </p><p>The ECP will then follow the same procedure with your Left Eye. </p><p>When examiner has completed checking both eyes, he/she will open the shutters and you will likely see two separate images. This is intentional. This part of the exam is to check your muscle balance using some prisms that can separate the images both Horizontally and Vertically. ECP will probably ask you to tell him when the two images are aligned Horizontally and then Vertically. </p><p>While the images are separated, YOU have a very important check to make. Compare the sharpness of the two images. If they are not equally sharp, be sure and tell the ECP which image is clearer. If there is a difference, the examiner will likely reduce the sharpness of the clearest image until they match. The important thing at this point is that they match. That lack of sharpness will be corrected in the next phase with both eyes working together. </p><p>Next the ECP will fuse the two images so both eyes are working together and repeat the Sphere procedure by gradually increasing the MINUS or decreasing the PLUS simultaneously on both eyes until you see the 20/20 or sometimes the 20/15 line of letters, very clearly. </p><p>The final part of the exam is checking your near vision. This is done using a small chart about 14 to 16 inches or 35 to 40 cm from your eyes. The examiner will ask you to read the smallest </p><p> </p><p>(lowest) line you can without straining. If you need some near focusing help, the Sphere PLUS will be increased until you can read the very small text easily. </p><p>That pretty much completes the exam. </p><p>Many people, who wear glasses, actually look forward to eye exams. Once you have become accustomed to having very good vision, you will probably find anything less, unacceptable. </p><p>Many times, after the exam, it will be suggested that you com back for another exam, some time in the future. Note that I used the word suggested. It is NOT a Command. If your detect a problem or if your vision seems uncomfortable, please DO NOT wait until the suggested date to seek an appointment to get your vision checked. </p><p>If the exam is for a child, and it is their first exam, you can help relieve the natural anxiety by fully explaining what is going to happen and most importantly assure them that it does not hurt. You might even consider getting an exam yourself, first, while the child observes. Many ECPs are excellent with children, understand their apprehension, and will go to great lengths to make them comfortable. This is very important, The best exams occur when the patient is relaxed. </p><p>I hope this helps. If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to ask. * The FOUR lenses in your eyes are: (from front to back) </p><p>1. The Cornea, a very strong fixed focus PLUS lens. The usual source of Astigmatism if the front surface is not a evenly curved. Note that the Cornea is living tissue that DOES NOT have a blood supply. It must get is Oxygen and Nutrients from tears and the air. </p><p>2. The Aqueous Humor, a watery fluid between the Cornea and the Iris. It has very little PLUS, but its power can be affected by blood chemistry, particularly abnormal Blood Glucose (diabetes) </p><p>3. The Crystalline Lens, a very strong variable focus lens whose power is Increased (only) by the action of the Ciliary Muscles. The Crystalline Lens is affected by Presbyopia and also the lens that can cloud up and become opaque. A condition called Cataract which requires surgery to correct. Most Cataract surgery today requires about 15 minutes per eye. The clouded Crystalline Lens is emulsified and removed thru a tiny incision in the side of the Cornea and an Intra Ocular Lens (IOL) is put in its place. The power of the IOL can be selected to correct Myopia or Hyperopia if desired. Initial recovery is very fast (hours) and resumption of most normal activities (some minor limitations) the next day. It usually takes about 30 days for complete recovery and a final prescription. </p><p>4. The Vitreous Humor, a thick gel that fills the eyeball behind the Crystalline Lens and the Retina. It contributes some PLUS, but like the Aqueous Humor, its power can be affected by blood chemistry. </p><p>Note: For most vision correction purposes, we only consider the Cornea, the Crystalline Lens, and the Ciliary Muscles.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ben Victor</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2018, 23:54</p><p>Cactus Jack </p><p> </p><p>Good morning from here. Thank you so very much for your response and advise, I really appreciate! I've learnt some real good things from your response and advise. :) Thanks once again. </p><p> </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2018, 20:46</p><p>Ben Victor, </p><p>The first thing that happens by wearing significant over correction is that you use your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses, which are the Active elements in your "Auto-Focus" System.  How much over correction you can Accommodate depends on your Amplitude of Accommodation. In general your Accommodation Range is based on your Age and the strength of your Ciliary Muscles.  Incidentally, for their size (very tiny), your Ciliary Muscles are the strongest muscles in the body. </p><p>Using the generally  accepted formulas for calculating Amplitude of Accommodation for a 21 YO.  Your minimum Accommodation should be about 18.5 - (0.3 * 21 (your age) or 12.2 diopters and your maximum should be about 25 -(0.4 * 21) or 16.6.  Everyone is different, but that should give you an idea. </p><p>Don't forget to consider Vertex Distance (VD) effects of your glasses if the prescription is more than about -4.50, because the amount of correction at your Cornea is what counts.  The formula for calculating Contact Lens Power vx. Glasses Power is the one for calculating VD effects at the Cornea. </p><p>Your -5.50 glasses have </p><p>-5.50 ^2 = 30.25 / 1000 = 0.03 * 12 mm (typical VD) = 0.36-5.50 = -5.137 at your Cornea. </p><p>-10 *2 = 100 / 1000 = 0.1 * 12 = 1.2 - 10 = -8.8 at your Cornea. </p><p>I have a very highly motivated acquaintance who was about 27 when he started Inducing Myopia and wore glasses just under -5.00.  It took about 2 years, but he was able to work himself up to wearing -20.00 while studying. </p><p>-20^2 = 400/1000 = 0.4 * 12 = 4.80 -12 = -15.2 at his cornea.  If his normal glasses were -5.00 his refractive error was about +4.7.  His Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses would have to produce an additional +10.50 for distance and about +2.50 more for reading a t16 inches or 40 cm.  A total of +13.00 diopters of accommodation. </p><p>If you do not have any refractive error you should be able to build up your Ciliary Muscles so you can probably build up to producing +13 or +14 diopters of Accommodation .  If you can do that, you should be able to work up to around -17 or -18 glasses and read with them, if you work hard.  </p><p>After he accomplished his goal, he quit wearing the -20.00.  Because most of the myopia he induced was Pseudo Myopia,  he gradually reverted  to about 1 diopter of Axial or True Myopia more, than he needed before he started wearing the stronger glasses. </p><p>You may be able to do a little better if you want to, but from here on out, only increase your prescription by about 1 diopter every month or so.  Wearing over correction is a bit like lifting weights at the gym.  If you increase the weight too fast, you will strain your muscles and that is detrimental to what you want to accomplish. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ben Victor</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2018, 19:04</p><p>Hi, I'm male and 21 years old. I'm not myopic, but I'm going to make sure I induce a degree of permanent myopia(I don't care how old I am). I started wearing -5.50Ds last year  the 19th of december - So I've worn those for two months now. I just got the -10.0Ds, and they feel very strong on my eyes. Anyways, I'm going to wear them all day everyday for a year and take note of any differences in my vision. Thanks! :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2018, 17:23</p><p>denden </p><p>I'm not sure where or who I who it was that I picked up your age as being 19. I'm thinking maybe it was our friend MROP that is only 19? Saying that I wonder how her eye exam went. I think she is going to come away with her first ever prescription for glasses which should be exciting for her. I think she's sure to get at the very least a written prescription of -.50 in each eye and maybe even more. The main thing for her will be that she actually does need to wear glasses and her vision isn't perfect anymore. Here in the US it is just a few minutes past 6:00PM In the UK I think it is just past midnight.  </p><p>Sorry to hear that your glasses has been delayed due to weather. I'm sure you're looking forward to getting them as well. When you get them when are you planning on wearing them? Aren't the glasses you ordered somewhere around -2.00? If your partner sees you wearing new glasses isn't he likely going to want to try your glasses on? What are you going to say if he should notice that their stronger than your previous glasses? I only ask you questions like this so that you're prepared in case sometime like that happens. But you seem pretty sharp without my help so i'm sure you would have an answer.      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2018, 12:12</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>I think you might have confused me with the girl that has horribly myopic siblings - she was saying that she was 19.  </p><p> </p><p>The glasses I ordered have been shipped but because of the extreme weather in the UK at the moment the delivery has been cancelled. I am eagerly waiting for them at the moment. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;02 Mar 2018, 10:01</p><p>denden </p><p>Team sports are usually the sports that are probably better suited for wearing contacts. Sports like soccer or as they call it in the UK football, rugby and basketball are sports where wearing glasses isn't advisable.And needless to say if you were doing karate wearing glasses won't be a good idea. But power lifting you can do with glasses, with contacts or without any vision correction at all if you want because you  don't need perfect vision to do that.Yes any type of sports that requires good distance vision like softball or baseball you wouldn't be able to play very well without glasses or contacts and contacts would be much safer. Many years ago I had my own women's softball team for 14 years. The girls ranged in age from 16 to 35, but most all of them were under 22. Most of the girls I got while they were in high school. This was back before contacts were very comfortable and often wouldn't stay on very well. Early on a couple of the girls wore glasses which they needed for distance. At the time I didn't know really anything about glasses except that I preferred to date glasses wearing girls. Besides being the manager of the team I also coached 1st base. The very first year in our very first game after one of the girls got a hit and was on 1sr base she asked me to hold her glasses for her. I didn't mind that at all. I assume she was afraid of maybe having some type of contact at another base and she didn't want her glasses on in case that happened. The other glasses wearers also would have me hold their glasses for them if they reached base. As each year came it seemed that more and more of my girls were starting to wear glasses. I assume things like starting to drive and getting jobs resulted in them getting glasses. My 3rd baseman was one of the new glasses wearers and in practice I could tell that she seemed much more afraid of the ball than she used. I had a talk with her and she said that she was afraid of the ball hitting her in the face and breaking her glasses. I suggested since she didn't need to see that far playing 3rd base that she should try playing without her glasses. She took her glasses off and I started hitting her ground balls and she didn't have any problem at all with seeing the ball.  the ones that played in the outfield of course needed their glasses in order to see the ball but they didn't have any reason to fear their glasses getting broken either. By the last year of having the team 7 of the 15 girls wore glasses. </p><p>I didn't realize that you're 23 now. I only saw something in your early comments about being 19 in a conversation with Cactus Jack. You right you really are nearing the time where inducing some myopia is nearing being impossible soon. Your current glasses look really nice. I'm sure they look very good on you as well. With as much thought that you have put into this I was pretty sure that you probably already a certain style of glasses that you want as your full time glasses. It really helps that your partner loves how you look wearing your glasses since you're going to be wearing glasses far more often than he's used to seeing you in glasses. Like I said once he gets used to seeing you wearing glasses all the time he will accept that as your new look. And i'm sure you're going to give him plenty of opportunity to see you without your glasses as well.  </p><p>I'm glad that you tried wearing your -2.50 contacts in both eyes and even better that your eyes didn't seem to mind at all. If your eyes are that comfortable with just your -2.50 contacts it wouldn't be a bad idea to push your eyes a bit more by wearing your glasses over the top them as well. The more close work, such as studying, with your contacts and glasses on the better. You want your eyes to feel like their working harder than normal. In other words having your eyes stressed a bit is a good thing. That is what is going to cause your eyes to change. </p><p>Did the glasses you ordered ever arrive? i know you had your prescribed glasses and sunglasses changed to a stronger prescription that matched the glasses you wore back in high school when you were doing GOC.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lovelenses</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2018, 20:37</p><p>Denden - I completely understand your wish to be myopic. Thought I would share my story since I have been reading posts for awhile. I developed cataracts at 48 years old and talked to my opthamologist about monofocal lenses with a focal point on near distance. I do a lot of close up work for my job and the doctor agreed with my choice. I was tired of the whole presbyopia and reading glasses thing and decided to fufill my wish to be myopic. Surgery went perfectly and I now need glasses full time with a prescription of minus 2.75. Everything is blurry without my glasses and I love it. Im happy with the prescription and love the way my glasses look. Hope everything goes well for you trying to induce some myopia. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glass Lenses</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2018, 18:54</p><p>MROP </p><p>Tomorrow is the big day. Happy prescription!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2018, 10:13</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>I've never been good at nor enjoyed team based sports. I used to do Karate but that's now off limits after getting a nose surgery (not a nose job lol). At the moment I am doing heavy lifting at a local gym which does not really require corrected vision. But you never know, maybe I will get into some sort of sports that require good distance vision in the future. I would also wear contacts for special occasions where glasses may look out of place, e.g. weddings, upscale events etc. </p><p> </p><p>I am currently 23, not 19. I fear that I might be too late to induce a good amount of myopia, but I will give it my best while I have the chance.  </p><p> </p><p>These are my current specs: https://gvfrance.liquifire.com/gvfrance?set=angle[1],articleNumber[275876],company[gdo],finalSize[productdetails]&amp;call;=url[file:common/productPresentation0517] </p><p> </p><p>I really like that style. My partner also loves the way they fit on me but he would probably want to see me bare eyed as well sometimes. That won't be an issue since I enjoy nearsighted vision anyway so I will keep my glasses off sometimes.  </p><p> </p><p>Following your advice on how to use up my dailies, I wore my -2.50 contacts on both eyes today. I barely noticed any difference, so I might just wear the same power in both eyes from now on. It gives me the flexibility to put on my glasses to bump up the overcorrection when I'm alone. I have an insane amount of studying to do nowadays so it's perfect.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;01 Mar 2018, 09:44</p><p>denden </p><p>You really hadn't talked much about how you will feel about wearing glasses once your eyes reach your goal of -1.50 to -2.00. Of course it's just as important that you really like how you look wearing glasses since you're likely going to be wearing glasses for the rest of your life. Of course there may be times when you may not want to wear glasses and for those times you will have the option to wear contacts instead. If you play sports contacts are a much better option than wearing your glasses which depending on the sport could get broken. Just curious what sports do you play? Once your eyes become stable and you have an actual prescription I have a feeling that you're going to have more than one pair of glasses in your prescription to choose from. With Zenni having several hundred to choose from for under $13.00 it should be easy for you assemble a nice selection of your own. Don't forget once you get settled at a final prescription be sure to get the optional AR coating (anti-reflective) on your glasses.  </p><p>Because you have done so much research about being nearsighted and even simulated being nearsighted by doing GOC you are going into this with your soon to be nearsighted eyes wide open. So i'm sure after 10 years of wanting this you would regret it more if you didn't do it now while you still have the chance. You're 19 so as you know time could be running out for you at any time for your eyes to be changed. Based on your late night trip to the supermarket that you did bare eyed apparently things were noticeably more blurry that ever before. You managed that in less than a month of wearing over correction.  </p><p>Since you really like how you look wearing glasses I assume that you already have a certain pair or style picked out that you want as your full time glasses? Are you willing to share that now? So far you have pretty much only wore glasses part time around your partner. Do you think he will be surprised once you start wearing your glasses full time? Since you said that he really doesn't have much, if any interest in optics, i'm sure he will quickly get used to seeing you wearing glasses all the time and not make much out of it.        </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2018, 15:57</p><p>Also, I'm aware of how weird my wish to be nearsighted is. That's why I tried to grow out of it to no avail. I wasn't inducing until now because I was afraid I'd regret it later, but considering it's been 10 years and my wish is just as strong, I think I am meant to be nearsighted.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2018, 15:50</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Glad you enjoyed my story. I think I am influenced by all of the reasons you mentioned. I really like how I look in glasses; I think they suit my intellectual personality. At first I did the GOC because I felt like I'd be judged for wearing such a small prescription full time, and you know how much hate people get for using glasses as a fashion accessory. However, GOC made me realise I not only liked the glasses but also nearsighted vision. I was fascinatee by how I coulr alternate between sharp and blurry vision with glasses and contacts. </p><p> </p><p>I don't think I would bother with contacts that much if I was naturally nearsighted. I'd still get some dailies to pop on if a situation calls for them (e.g. sports, an outfit that clashes with my glasses) but glasses would be my default correction.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2018, 10:19</p><p>denden </p><p>Oh and i'm not exactly sure now how the optometrist can tell if someone wears contacts or not. I know back when their was only the hard contacts they left a ring or slot where they sat on the corneas. But the newer soft lenses shouldn't do that. If someone over wears their contacts which nearly everyone does the doctor can tell by the blood vessels as you say. I had a friend that had her contacts taken away because she had too many blood vessels going into her eyes. I'm just mentioning it so if by any chance the doctor does notice something when examining your eyes and asks you about it you won't be taken by surprise.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Feb 2018, 10:11</p><p>denden </p><p>I didn't in anyway find your comment about how you were able to get both contacts and glasses boring. I was just very curious how without having some form of a prescription and being in high school meaning that you were considered under age you were able to get contacts and glasses. My thought was that you maybe got your glasses from a friend that wore glasses and when she got new glasses you asked for her old ones. I have seen this happen numerous times myself. Needless to say I know nothing about how things work in Turkey as far as getting glasses and or contacts. I have been able to tell by your comments and questions that you have really done your research on the subject of optics. This explains why you have a very good idea as to the perfect prescription you want your glasses to be because you have already seen what -1.50 vision is like. So when did you get your first actual prescribed glasses? I believe you said they were only -.50 / -.25. Hardly anything at all really and like you said not even enough to restrict you from driving without glasses. Of course every doctor even if your eyesight is still legal to drive without glasses will recommend that you wear your glasses when driving because you're going to see slightly better with your glasses than without them of course. I was wondering why you have only recently decided that you want to induce some myopia? Everybody has a reason. Some just because they want to have a good reason for wearing glasses. Some because they feel they look better wearing glasses. Some because they like the way wearing glasses feels. And some like you, enjoy being able to take their glasses off and be in their own little blurred world. Your actual need for glasses doesn't provide you with enough blurred vision to allow you go to that world. So you're looking forward to enjoying that blurry world you want when you take your glasses off and the nice sharp clear world when you put your glasses back on. The only question is are you going to be okay with wearing glasses full time? Of course you have the option of wearing contacts but their not as easy to take off when you want to go into your blurry little world.  I totally get it and based on your own findings it really seems like your eyes are more than willing to induce the myopia you're wanting.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Glass Lenses</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2018, 18:28</p><p>MROP </p><p> On Friday, wear your strongest glasses while driving to your appointment, arrive earlier, and park across the street, or close by and spend as much time as possible reading a book, with glasses on. Hold it as close to your eyes as you can tolerate. Then arrive at the appointment just a few minutes before your scheduled time. You of course will be bareyed. </p><p> You may be asked to fill out a form, and if so get your eyes as close to it as you can, and try to squint a lot. Many times the person at the front desk is also the one that will give you some preliminary vision tests, so you want to appear myopic to that person. </p><p> When asked to read an eye chart in the beginning, when you get to a line that is even a bit fuzzy, tell the doctor that you think you may be able to see it more clearly if you squint. He, or she will tell you not to. </p><p> It is possible that you left eye has become more myopic than the right. </p><p> A number of years ago, a few friends were inducing, and one girl had her right eye take off, and the left one lagged. After some time the right eye went to -3.00, and the left -.50. When I lost contact with her the right had gone to -9.50, with some astigmatism, and the left at -1.00. Her doctor had also prescribed a bifocal for the bad eye only, as reading with it was impossible with the  -9.50 lense. </p><p> She actually looked really hot in those glasses, with a thick, plano front bifocal, and the other eye with very little correction.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2018, 14:51</p><p>MROP, </p><p> </p><p>I'm assuming that you ordered Air Optix Night and Day. What is your base curve, if I may ask?  </p><p>(slightly off-topic, if you are using visiondirect.co.uk I LOOOOVE the Haribos they send with each order! Makes me look forward to each contact lens update) </p><p> </p><p>I will definitely update you once I get around to wearing my Acuvue Oasys. </p><p> </p><p>Soundmanpt, how can optometrists tell one is a contact lens wearer? Is it because their eyes have more tiny vessels? I thought contacts made no structural change to one's eyes if all the hygienic rules were followed...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2018, 14:45</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Forgot to mention, I also got the R -1.25 L -0.75 -0.50 prescription copied onto my sunglasses, which I have been using quite often since. Those, fortunately, never fell out of style.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2018, 14:37</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Very well. Even though I live in the UK now, I'm originally from Turkey. I moved to the UK because I was dissatisfied with the way many things were in Turkey, including people's tendency to bend the rules. However, that can occasionally be a good thing; in this particular case, it meant that I could convince opticians to manufacture glasses for me without a formal prescription as long as I seemed aware of how optics worked.  </p><p> </p><p>So I went ahead and studied optics meticulously. I think I even stumbled upon this forum back then but didn't post anything (not that I remember). I was too chicken to actively try to induce myopia so I decided that GOC would be the way to go. First I wanted to learn how to use contacts, so I went to one optician and told him that my prescription was -0.75 and -1.25. I felt that I could tolerate that much overcorrection without eye strain. He handed me Acuvue Oasys in 8.4 BC, which seemed extremely popular among my nearsighted classmates as well (also in my school it felt like almost everyone was nearsighted lol). Having done my due diligence, I wanted to try 8.6 BC contacts as well to try and find my best fit. Going to an optometrist wasn't an option back then. Luckily I had a friend with the exact same prescription, who was currently on Air Optix with 8.6 BC. She wanted to try Acuvue Oasys as well as her Air Optix were not feeling that comfortable anymore, so we agreed to exchange one pair from each brand. I concluded that Acuvue Oasys were significantly more comfortable, and she concluded that she would continue her steady relationship with Air Optix. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, after wearing minus lenses for a while, I wanted to take the step forward to wearing GOC. I started complaining to my friends that I couldn't see the board anymore with my contacts on. I went to another optician and asked him to update my glasses with R -1.75 L -1.25 -0.50 180 lenses. I also bought +1.25 contacts "for my sister" (who doesn't exist, I'm an only child). I used that combination for quite a while. Over time I found myself wearing my glasses less and less because I was enjoying the nearsighted vision in a weird way I couldn't understand myself. Maybe it has to do with my introverted personality. It felt liberating in a way to not be overwhelmed by so much detail in the world. Unfortunately, a classmate who also seemed quite into optics noticed once that I had contacts on. I was super scared of being found out about my GOC thing so I stopped wearing plus lenses shortly after that. </p><p> </p><p>Having told my friends my myopia is around -1.75, I needed a consistent follow up story. I went to the optician that sold me the -0.75 -1.25 lenses and told him to fit my glasses with these lenses. I informed him about the -0.50 astigmatism in my left eye as well. Then I went to school with these glasses and told them my prescription has been reduced. I wore these glasses on and off mainly because I got really bored of their style. Then I got caught up with other things, such as studying for exams to get into a British university, and my myopia obsession got put in the backburner. </p><p> </p><p>And now here I am, still missing my fake nearsighted days from high school and hoping I'm not too late to attain that vision permanently.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2018, 12:52</p><p>denden </p><p>I'm sure you can't wait to start wearing your Acuvue Oasys extended war contacts. First of all because their stronger than your dailies which your eyes seem to not even notice that you're wearing anymore. And being able to pretty much wear them constantly will mean that your eyes will constantly be seeing through over correction. You know now that you had your glasses made up with the prescription you wore back in high school when you were doing GOC you could still wear your dailies along with those glasses if you wanted to use them up.That combination would have your eyes seeing through combined lenses of -4.00 / -3.25.  </p><p>Okay just so you know I really don't mind being bored so I would really love to hear how a sweet little high school girl even knew what GOC was and how you managed to pull it off? You somehow not only managed to get plus contacts but also minus glasses and even prescription sunglasses as well. So did you wear GOC most days at school. So do tell how you were able to get contacts and glasses when you shouldn't have even been able to get a credit card.      </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2018, 11:30</p><p>MROP </p><p>Sorry to hear your appointment got pushed back. Are you still scheduled for late in the day on Friday? I'm sure you have to be happy that all your hard work seems to be working, at least with your left eye anyway. It sounds like your left is going to need a stronger prescription than your right eye. Your right eye may just be a little stronger than your left eye, but by continuing to wear over correction it will soon be as blurry as your left eye is. I can't wait to hear what your prescription will be. Of course I know it really doesn't matter because you're still going to wear your stronger glasses and contacts anyway.  </p><p>I'm glad you're being careful about wearing contacts. If the contacts you're currently wearing aren't comfortable they could cause a problem which you don't need now. By the way the doctor is likely going to be able to tell when he / she examines your eyes that you are a contact lens wearer. So it I would suggest that you say that you bought some colored contacts in a boutique or on line as non prescription to wear for fashion sake.  </p><p>Then next week you when you talk to your family by phone you need to tell them that you need to start wearing glasses now. If you were already complaining about your eyesight when you were home over Christmas it probably won't surprise them that much. When do you go home again? You're going to have to wear a pair of your weaker glasses along with your contacts when you go home. You know that someone is for sure going to ask to try your glasses on. So your glasses can't be too strong already. Probably something around -1.25 or -1.50 would be okay as a first pair, or so they think anyway. </p><p>Theirs a young lady that works at a convenience store / gas station that has been holding off with getting her eyes checked because she knows that she needs to start wearing glasses and she is a bit shy and scared about having to wear glasses. I started pushing her several weeks ago when I got gas their and the other girl working was wearing glasses so I was telling her how I can get her glasses so much cheaper on line. She told me that me that she is in fact due to get her eyes checked and she knows that she needs stronger glasses again. She told me that she had only started wearing her glasses full time a few months ago, but now she feels like she can't see anything without her glasses anymore. I asked her if she knew what her prescription is and of course she had no idea. I leaned over her counter and asked her if I could see her glasses as I took them off of her. Looking through her glasses i'm pretty sure they were around -2.00 and not more than -2.50 maybe. She said that she started wearing glasses about 4 years ago. When I gave her glasses back to her she pointed at her co worker and said how she has been putting off with getting her eyes examined. Instantly that girl turned red in the face. It took a bit to get her to even talk about her eyes. She finally admitted that she has trouble when her eyes get tired reading small print and her distance is always a little blurry but worse at night. I told her I was going to make a point to come in at least once a week until she gave up and went for her eye exam. She told me Saturday evening that she has an appointment for this Thursday to get her eyes examined and she said she will be getting her glasses from me since I can get her an AR coating (anti-reflective) for only $5.00 and the the stores charge $45.00 or more for that coating and insurance won't cover it. Also getting them form me she can not only get her glasses that she needs but also a nice pair of prescription sunglasses.         </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2018, 10:19</p><p>Just an update from me, </p><p> </p><p>I've now been scheduled to work tomorrow so I have my eye exam booked for Friday morning now. Any last minute tips for me? </p><p> </p><p>I've been wearing my glasses and or contacts constantly and have recently noticed that my vision in my left eye is significantly worse than my right. In the day I get no blur in my right eye ( I feel a little strained sometimes, but no physical blur) yet with my left I am finding it a lot harder to focus on things. At night, this is near impossible with my left eye. Even the television which is less than 2 metres from me is difficult to see when I'm tired. Is this a good sign? does this mean my left eye is more myopic? I'm wondering if I have slight astigmatism in the left eye maybe. </p><p> </p><p>I'll let you all know how my eye exam goes. </p><p> </p><p>Also Denden, I've just ordered myself some more extended wear lenses that are suitable for up to 30 days and nights of constant wear ( obviously I won't go 30 nights wearing them) but you'll have to let me know how they are to sleep in! I've got some extended wear lenses now but am not a fan of the fit compared to the brand I had before, so have gone back to the previous brand, just choosing their extended wear lenses this time!! Looking forward to sleeping in my lenses. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lentifan</b>&nbsp;27 Feb 2018, 08:00</p><p>WantMyos </p><p> </p><p>I can well understand your curiosity in wanting to know how it feels to wear glasses with strong lenses like your siblings and I wish you luck with your attempts to either (or both) simulate myopia or enjoy GOC.  If you are happy wearing glasses, i see no harm in inducing myopia and/or developing strabismus by wearing prism glasses.  After all, strabismus would be one way of ensuring you need to wear glasses if that is what you want to do. </p><p>I am interested to know if your siblings all wear glasses, or do some of them wear contact lenses?  Do they manage to lead normal lives with their high prescriptions?  Do they ever complain about difficulties due to their myopia? </p><p>While I am sure Cactus is correct in advising you to start with a relatively low prescription if doing GOC, this does mean quite an expense in building up to the sort of prescription that your siblings have and which would necessitate myodiscs - say more than 20 dioptres - due to needing potentially several pairs of contacts and matching glasses at progressively higher presriptions.  </p><p>If all your siblings use the same optician, I wonder what others think of the idea of going to them and saying you want to understand by experience the sort of vision your siblings have with their glasses and asking them to prescribe some GOC to enable you to do this.</p><p></p><hr>

I'm still not done with my dailies in -2.75 and -2.50 but I am looking forward to switching to my new contacts. Today I was thinking for a moment "I need to put on my contacts as my eyes are relaxing" only to realise I had them on!! It feels like I'm not wearing overcorrection anymore. How cool is that? </p><p> </p><p>The glasses I ordered online have been shipped. Also I convinced an optician to copy a pair of prescription sunglasses I had from high school (R -1.25 L -0.75 -0.50 180) into my current glasses. Don't ask how I managed to get those sunglasses in high school, it's a long and tedious story and I'd rather not bore you with it lol. Now I'm happy that even my weakest glasses overcorrect me. In fact I am planning to hit the optometrist when I start having blurry vision with my weakest glasses, as it would mean an increase of more than -0.50 (which spells victory).</p><p></p><hr>

My math skills are not the best when it comes to basic math, but I am pretty good at higher level math. However, I sure know my way around a calculator so that helps make up for my lack of basic math skills. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2018, 21:31</p><p>WantMyos, </p><p>Within limits, you can do both. </p><p>GOC is actually easier than Inducing Myopia because you are in control of what happens and while there are optical limitations, you are not constrained by Physiological limitations.  If don't correctly, GOC is not particularly harmful because no attempt is made to alter the actual optical properties of your eyes. </p><p>The biggest mistake most people make when starting GOC is to be too greedy and want to start with a very high glasses prescription.  The problem with that is that your brain has to learn to see with very significant optical aberrations associated with high prescription glasses.  Your brain can learn to deal with that, but you have to give it time. </p><p>Your siblings have had years of experience wearing high minus glasses and they did not become extremely myopic overnight. </p><p>If you want to try GOC, the first step is to get a prescription for Contact Lenses and instruction about how to insert them, remove them, and care for them.  For GOC purposes the things you are most interested in are:  Your Base Curve, Diameter, and to some extent, the brand.  You don't want a Toric lens for your Astigmatism in the Right Eye, but a compromise Sphere only prescription where 1/2 of the Cylinder power is added to the Sphere or -0.75 in both eyes. </p><p>You won't actually wear the -0.75 lenses for GOC, but CLs with quite a bit of Sphere only PLUS that has to be neutralized by glasses with significant MINUS Sphere and an exact transference of the Cylinder and Axis to the glasses. </p><p>Here is something to think about.  I suggest starting with a GOC glasses prescription of -4 or less. </p><p>How are your math skills? </p><p>C.. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Feb 2018, 10:09</p><p>WantMyos </p><p>Over the years I have always tried to help with advice and encouragement to anyone that has wanted to induce myopia so they can either start wearing glasses for the first time or so they can increase their need for wearing stronger glasses. In order for them to do that i'm well aware that they will be making their eyesight worse. But i'm sure they are also well aware of that also. If their successful the result will be that they will finally have their wish of be a glasses wearer or wearing stronger glasses. But either way their eyesight may no longer be perfect like it was before or they may need their glasses more than they did before they would still have perfect vision with the aid of their glasses and could continue to do everything they were ever able to do before they started wearing glasses. My point is their need for wearing glasses didn't ruin or change their life because they would still be able to everything they ever did before. And God forbid, if they ever tire of wearing glasses they have the option of wearing contacts to correct their vision or if they want their vision completely restored they can even get lasik and be back to perfect vision. In other words it's reversible. Denden and MROP or both currently trying to induce some myopia. It's easy to see that they both have studied this for some time before making this decision. Neither of them are shooting for the moon by wanting their eyesight to be in the double digits. They both only want to be nearsighted enough that they will both need to wear their glasses full time if they want to see clearly. But they will both be able to function well enough without their glasses. I urge you before you even start wearing the glasses you have on order to really think long and hard before wearing them. You got your first glasses about a year ago with a very weak prescription but still enough that your eyes are able to see better wearing your glasses. But as you know you're still able to see pretty well without them. After you got your first glasses how much do you wear them? Do you wear them full time because you really want to wear glasses that badly or only when you need them? I really wish that you had ordered your new glasses without the prisms in them. There must have been some reason why God decided to spare you the same terrible eyesight he has given your entire family. You need to really think about it that way instead of feeling left out in someway. Maybe God finally knowing how badly you were wanting to wear glasses decided to grant you your wish by making your eyes just bad enough that you now would need to wear glasses and you wouldn't have your perfect vision anymore? Inducing so you need your glasses more is one thing and I would support you with that because your eyes would still be able to see 20/20 with glasses or even dare I say it, contacts. And of course wearing glasses would never stop you from doing whatever type of job you may choose as your career. In fact wearing glasses usually even tends to help with getting hired. But getting prisms in your glasses is going to ruin your eyes very quickly. Once you start with prisms their is no going back. You have had glasses for over a year so by now i assume that you're fine with wearing glasses and probably even enjoy wearing your glasses. But when you take your glasses now things are probably a little bit blurry but really not too bad because your eyesight isn't very bad. But once your eyes get adjusted to your stronger glasses not only will things be much more blurry when you take off your glasses but you may soon start seeing everything with double vision when your glasses are off. As your eyes continue to get worse you will even get double vision while your wearing your glasses if your eyes get tired which they are sure to do while your over correction them. If you drive a car this could be a real problem for you trying to see to drive and seeing double. Have you ever talked to any of your siblings about what you're wanting to do? I really think they would beg you not to do it and be happy that you were blessed with so much better eyesight. I have a feeling that none of your siblings can see very well even with their strong myodisc glasses. Do you really want to go through life unable to see anything clearly even with your glasses on? Once you wreck your eyes wearing prisms you will never have the option of wearing contacts and unlike just being myopic it isn't reversible. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2018, 15:38</p><p>WantMyos, </p><p> </p><p>As Cactus Jack stated, you can't really induce high myopia like that of your siblings anymore. You may be able to increase your prescription somewhat but not enough to wear Myodiscs.  </p><p> </p><p>My suggestion to you would be to try Glasses Over Contacts (commonly referred to as GOC here), which is done by wearing plus contacts under thick minus glasses. For lower prescriptions the method is straightforward - let's say you wanted to wear -3.00 glasses, you would need to order +2.25 contacts so that their combination equals the amount of minus you need with your natural eyesight. For higher prescriptions, it becomes more complicated because after a certain point contact lens powers have a different equivalent in glasses. I'm sure Cactus Jack or Soundmanpt would be able to help you do the maths if you are interested. </p><p> </p><p>The benefit of GOC is that you get to experience the nearsighted vision that you wish for without any risk for permanent damage (provided that you receive the appropriate training for using contacts). I personally did GOC for a while before deciding for sure that I actually wanted to become more nearsighted. If your reasons are solely cosmetic (i.e. you want to wear myodics) and you don't care for having blurry vision, then it's really not worth ruining your eyesight for. </p><p> </p><p>I personally only want to be mildly nearsighted (my sweet spot is around -1.50), and I'd rather not be nearsighted at all than be over -4.00. That said, I am not judging you - this forum is a safe haven for us myope wannabes who would not be understood elsewhere. All I want is for you to know exactly what you are wishing for before you take any irreversible steps towards it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2018, 15:32</p><p>WantMyos, </p><p>What you are wanting to do requires some planning and execution. </p><p>You have asked for advice on how to Induce Myopia and Strabismus (Esophoria). To do that you need to order glasses that have more Sphere correction than your recent eye exam specified and with Base Out Prism. </p><p>When you get them, you need to start wearing the -1.00 over correction when ever you are awake.  Initially, you may notice some stress when reading, but that will soon go away and the -1.00 over will be comfortable.  When that happens, switch to the -2.00 over correction.  Repeat the process and order the -3.00 over correction.  This may take several months.  Try to avoid wearing your original prescription if you can (with two exceptions). </p><p>Exception 1. If you are successful, you will notice that when you take off your -2 or -3 glasses, distant objects are blurry with your original glasses. Only do this very briefly. </p><p>Exception 2. If you need to go back to the ECP that prescribed your current prescription, wear the glasses you were prescribed, but complain of blurry vision, particularly at night and occasional double vision if you are tired. </p><p>At some point after wearing over correction for some months, you might want to get an official exam to measure your progress of Inducing Myopia and Strabismus.  DO NOT go to the ECP who prescribed your current prescription, wearing glasses that are different than what he/she prescribed. </p><p>You need to select a different ECP that you have not seen before and go to the exam wearing the -2 or -3 glasses for as long as you can before entering the office, change to the -1 glasses and enter the office.  Your complaint needs to be blurry distance vision and problems with double vision.  Ideally, you will be prescribed an increased MINUS prescription with additional BO prism which is common for a Myope needing a new prescription.  Do not order glasses with this new prescription, but use it as a basis for ordering new glasses as you did with your current prescription. </p><p>Does this help? </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>WantMyos</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2018, 13:27</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p>I am a bit confused, do you want me to wear my over correction for months before going into a new eye doctor, or just before the exam? If I were to do it just before the exam, wouldn't I just end up with the same prescription or very minimal change? </p><p>To answer your questions: </p><p>1. Both my parents are pretty myopic. I believe my dad has a stronger prescription than my mom. I think his prescription is about -15/-17. On my mom's side my grandparents just need glasses for reading. However, my aunts and uncles all are nearsighted. On my dad's side my grandma is very myopic, more than my 19 year old brother. She is legally blind now. My grandpa is also pretty nearsighted, but I think he is not even in the -20s.  </p><p>2 and 3. The 22 year old brothers are identical twins, and the 14 year old siblings are also twins. My 19 year old brother and I are just Irish twins, he is  about 7 and half months younger than me. </p><p>4. They are the only ones who have had problems with their eyes being crossed. My oldest brother had surgery when he was younger, but it was not successful, and both siblings with strabismus did vision therapy when they were younger. </p><p>5. Not as far as I know. </p><p>(6.)

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2018, 10:22</p><p>WantMyos, </p><p>In reviewing your sibling's prescriptions, there is very strong evidence of genetics.  I have a few questions: </p><p>1. Are your parents or grandparents also very Myopic? </p><p>2. Your 22 YO Brothers appear to be identical twins.  Is that correct? </p><p>3. Your 14 YO Brother and Sister also appear to be twins.  Is that correct? </p><p>4. It appears that your 24 YO Brother and 14 YO Sister have strabismus issues. Have any other siblings had strabismus problems that have been corrected by surgery or therapy? </p><p>5. Has your family been asked to participate in any genetic studies related to Myopia? </p><p>Over the years there have been several families where Myopia appears to have a very strong genetic component. Most babies are born with Hyperopia because their eyeballs have to be small enough to fit in the bony eye socket in their small heads.  There is evidence that their Accommodative effort is a factor in stimulating eyeball growth which reduces Hyperopia or may increase Myopia if excessive growth occurs. </p><p>Another questions: </p><p>Have any of your siblings had any problems with Retinal Detachment? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;25 Feb 2018, 09:06</p><p>WantMyos, </p><p>You asked about tips for getting prism prescribed. </p><p>The first step in getting prism prescribed is be wearing prism in your glasses when you get an eye exam, but you must NOT go to an ECP who has previously prescribed glasses without any prism.  They will ask a lot of questions that are hard to answer. </p><p>There are a few other precautions you need to take when it comes time for an exam.  There is no point in getting an exam until you should have been wearing significant over correction for a while (months), but in your situation, you should probably change to the -1.00 over correction just before the exam and report that distance vision is blurry and that you are having problems with double vision when you are tired and may need an increase in your prism correction. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2018, 20:30</p><p>WantMyos, </p><p>Your siblings are a prime example of genetics in action.  More about that later. </p><p>It appears that you were the lucky or unlucky one, depending on your point of view. </p><p>It is impossible to predict how much Myopia you can induce.  I know of one highly motivated individual, a bit older than you are, whose natural prescription was just under -5.00.  He was ultimately able to wear -20.00 glasses and read pretty comfortably with them. However, there is an optical phenomenon involved with high prescription glasses that affects their effective power.  It is called Vertex Distance. </p><p>Vertex Distance (VD) is the distance from the front surface of the Cornea to the back surface of the glasses lenses.  It is very hard to measure accurately and at very high prescriptions it can have a very significant effect on the effective power of the glasses.  For our purposes, we will talk about the VD effects on MINUS lenses.  VD effects of PLUS lenses is the opposite of MINUS lenses. </p><p>VD effects of MINUS glasses lenses are LESS at the Cornea that the optical power of the glasses lenses.  I don't know if you have studied Math or Physics (Optics) in school, but the math is not all that hard to use.  VD effects are the SQUARE (^2) of the diopter power of the lenses, divided by 1000 and multiplied by the VD in mm.  Typical VD is between 10 and 13 mm.  Because of the SQUARE function, glasses lenses with less than about +/- 4.50 diopters have almost no VD effect, but VD effects for your 19 YO Brother, who needs -33.50 Sphere, are huge.  Let me do the math: </p><p>-33.50 x -33.50 = 1122.25 (the - sign gets lost) </p><p>1122.25 / 1000 = 1.12 diopters per mm. </p><p>I am pretty sure he wears Myodiscs, maybe even bi-concave type and I suspect his VD is around 12, so lets use that. </p><p>1.12 x 12 = 13.44 diopters -33.50 = -20.06 </p><p>Notice that even a small change in the location of his glasses can make a big difference in the effectiveness of his glasses.  It might be possible for him to wear Sphere only Contact Lenses to correct most of his Sphere and then glasses that correct his Astigmatism and the balance of his Sphere, but it takes an ECP who is a bit creative. </p><p>In the case of the individual I mentioned above, -20.00 glasses only have the effect of about -16.00 at the Cornea which was only -12.00 over his actual refractive error. </p><p>Lets talk a bit about Myopia.  This involves the optics of the eye and some of the Math discovered by Sir Isaac Newton (also of Gravity and Calculus fame) over 300 years ago.  The math is even easier. </p><p>There are two kinds of Myopia.  They have different causes, but the same effect, you need MINUS corrective lenses to have good vision.   </p><p>Axial or True Myopia is caused by a mismatch between the Total PLUS power of the eye's lens system and the length of the eyeball from the back of the Crystalline Lens to the Retina.  In a typical adult eye the Total PLUS power of the eye's lens system is about +59 diopters and the distance from the Crystalline Lens to the Retina is about 17 mm.  Eyeball growth is controlled primarily by genetics and somewhat by Visual Environment.  Most Axial or True Myopia is caused by excessive eyeball growth.  It is considered Permanent, because the eyeballs typically do not shrink in size or length once they have grown. </p><p>Pseudo or False Myopia has a completely different cause, but the same effect.  It is caused by the eye's Auto-Focus System having difficulty fully relaxing.  The Auto-Focus System in your eyes consists of some very tiny Ciliary Muscles and your Crystalline Lenses.  For a person with normal vision to be able to focus close to read or use a computer, your Ciliary Muscles have to squeeze your Crystalline Lenses to increase their PLUS power.  Fully Relaxed your Crystalline Lenses have about +16 diopters, but the Ciliary Muscles can squeeze the Crystalline Lenses and increase their PLUS power by about +2.50 to enable you to focus at about 16 inches or 40 cm.  The younger you are, the easier it is to increase the PLUS power of your Crystalline Lenses.  If you focus close for long enough, your Ciliary Muscles will have trouble fully relaxing and you will have Pseudo or False Myopia.  It is considered to be Temporary, but temporary can be a long time if you maintain close focus or OVER CORRECTION. </p><p>It it believed that close focusing may cause the production of a specific Eyeball Growth Hormone (EGH) by the Retiaa.  However, that hormone has not be isolated or identified. </p><p>In your situation you are trying to initially Induce some Pseudo Myopia and hope it is not too late for some additions Axial Myopia to develop.  It does take time.  It took 2 years for the -5.00 individual to be able to wear the -20 glasses. </p><p>You asked about strabismus or more specifically Esophoria.  It is actually easier than Inducing Myopia.  Your eye positions are controlled by a very sophisticated Eye Position Control System (My Name) (EPCS) in your brain.  The EPCS appears to be very easy to train or program and get to the point where you Need prism to be able to fuse the two images from your eyes.  Most ECPs are very reluctant to prescribe prism unless there are problems with Double Vision, or Convergence Issues.  If a person is already wearing prism correction and is having trouble with double vision (pretty common), that is a different story. </p><p>The need for Base Out prism is often related to Convergence issues. I suspect your 24 YO Brother's need for prism is related to his Myopia because he developed Myopia when he was very young and held things very close to be able to focus.  That action trained his eyes to converge and he needs quite a bit of BO prism to be able to fuse images.  I suspect that your siblings who do not need prism had their Myopia caught early enough that they either had muscle surgery or started wearing glasses early enough to be able to fuse distant object without prism. </p><p>BTW, I you are new to ES, you need to know that I am NOT and Eye Care Professional.  I am 80 and became interested in vision and optics because I was getting unsatisfactory answers from my ECP about my own eye problems.  I am an amateur in the original sense of the word as one who studies a subject because of love of knowledge.  My background is Electronic Engineering and Computer.  I also have double vision issues and wear BO prism to keep from seeing double. </p><p>Enough for now.  Hope this helps a little. </p><p>I would like to ask more questions about your family, but would prefer to do it at cactusjack1928@hotmail.com </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>WantMyos</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2018, 12:54</p><p>Hi, </p><p>I am nearsighted, but not that much. I finally got glasses about a year and a half ago. It was great, but they are not thick, and I really want thick glasses and/or myos. I want to have blurry vision. I think it is super cool. I have read a little about inducing myopia, but thought I would seek guidance here. Here is some information I think would be helpful in helping me: </p><p>I am 19 years old </p><p>Myopia does run in my family, most of my family is very nearsighted. </p><p>My current prescription is: -0.5, -0.5, 110 and -0.75.  </p><p>Like I said earlier, I have had glasses for about a year and a half. My first prescription was -0.5, 100 and -0.5. I just got my new glasses this week.  </p><p>I am a female </p><p>I also have another question. Is there any way to make your eyes permanently crossed? Two of my siblings are crosseyed, and I would love to be crosseyed too. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2018, 12:01</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>My actual prescription glasses are currently at an optician. I managed to convince one to fit them with stronger lenses without a prescription but that means I don't have access to any glasses at the moment. I live in a central location so I don't need to drive; the supermarket is only 10 minutes from my place. </p><p> </p><p>I was wearing plus contacts in high school to simulate nearsightedness. They were +1.25.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2018, 11:35</p><p>denden </p><p>So it was kind of an emergency that you had to go to the supermarket after you had already removed your contacts to go to bed. So putting them back on can take a bit of time and i'm sure you were in a rush. How come you didn't wear your actual prescription glasses to the supermarket? Did you drive to the supermarket? If your eyesight wasn't any better than around -1.25 / -.75 things had to be rather blurry for you. If your eyesight seems to be holding at no better than -1.25 / -.75 you now need to be wearing either glasses or contacts anytime you drive now. No more driving without correction. I'm sure that if you your new glasses were here you would have probably put your glasses on go to the market. I'm not sure if focusing your eyes helped or not. I think your eyes need actual lenses in front of them to actually work. I'm hoping once your glasses arrive you won't have any reason to be without either your contacts or glasses constantly.  </p><p>You're paying extra for contacts that are made to worn constantly so there shouldn't be any reason why you can't wear them to sleep in. But once you have your glasses you should clean your contacts every other day or so. Wear your glasses while their being cleaned. By the way why were you wearing plus contacts in high school? I assume that you got them from a friend that wore contacts and she gave you a few to wear? Do you recall what prescription they were? Were your eyes able to adjust to them or was things rather blurry wearing them?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2018, 10:59</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Also, that night without contacts, I was focusing my eyes as if I was wearing overcorrection. I only relaxed them for a few seconds because I was curious what my vision was like without any correction. If, for whatever reason, I am unable to wear my glasses or contacts in a situation, can I compensate by focusing my eyes to simulate myopic vision instead? It still puts my ciliary muscles to work.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2018, 10:56</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for sharing the story. Last night I did that because I had removed my contacts earlier to go to sleep and later, due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to wake up and go to the supermarket. When my Acuvue Oasys contacts arrive I am considering to wear them overnight. I did this in high school with plus contacts because I was hiding my contacts from my parents, and it was fine. I will take them out just before I shower and put them back on immediately after. This way my eyes will always be overcorrected.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2018, 10:18</p><p>denden </p><p>Glad to hear that you included your CYL in the glasses you have on order. Once you get them it will be interesting to see if that clears things up for you. I think it will. Like i said added extra SPH helps a bit but as far as I know it won't ever give you the same clear vision as having the CYL included in your prescription. Based on what you have said about your vision wearing -2.75 / -2.25 contacts full time your eyes seem to have fully adjusted to them just fine. So yes I think your eyes are ready for stronger contacts now. Increasing by -.75 in both eyes is a safe increase to go to.  </p><p>Just curious, why did you go to the supermarket without wearing your contacts? I hate to keep driving the point of how important it is to be constantly having your eyes looking through as much over correction as your eyes can tolerate. Going without either over correcting glasses or contacts is a bit of a setback because you allow your eyes to attempt to readjust to their natural prescription. You're 23 so you're likely nearing the point where your eyes could be starting to become stable. Once they get to that point you won't be able to cause in change in your eyesight no matter how hard you try. So your window of opportunity is slowly going to be closing soon. That said you should at least be happy that wearing over correction seems to be effecting your eyes the way you're hoping. I'm certain that you can tell if things are more blurry now then they were last month before you started wearing over correction.  </p><p>I think that both you and MROP should be able to get to your goals. MROP is wanting her eyes to get to around -2.00 and you're only wanting to get to around -1.50 as your actual prescription. Both numbers are very reasonable.  </p><p>In regards to your question about any personal success stories I have several but the one I found most interesting was a young lady that had recently been hired at a local sports bar I often go to. She was only 18 and just out of high school. I have been with a non profit vision group for many years. So because of that I also have a rather nice sample collection of glasses, mostly women's because i worked mainly with women and the women in our group worked mainly with men. All of my samples have some type of weak prescription in them of -.50 -.75 and -1.00. I use them as test glasses. Anyway because I have around 75 samples I found several years ago that i could also help other people get glasses at a cheap price. I soon found out that many of the young ladies working in the restaurant business don't have health insurance so that also means they don't have vision insurance either. I was shocked at how many told me that they knew they needed to be wearing glases but they couldn't afford the cost of and eye exam and even worse the cost of glasses. So they did without or the were wearing glasses that a friend gave them. I quickly found a local optical store that was willing to do eye exams for $35.00. Within several weeks a number of them took advantage of my offer and got their eyes examined and had me order their glasses for them. Total cost was only $50.00 to $55.00. So from then on whenever a new girl was hired the other girls would introduce her to me and they always added in that if she needed glasses I was the person they needed to talk to. Shannon was this new girls name. She told me that she was wearing contacts and that she really did need new glasses. We arranged meeting a few days later before she started her shift at work so she could look through my samples and pick something out. She ddin't want to go back to where she got her eyes examined at to ask for a copy of her glasses prescription and insisted that if I got her glasses the same as her contact prescription she would be fine. She said that her contacts were -1.75 for both eyes. As she was going through and trying on nearly every sample pair I had she soon realized that my samples had prescription in them. After she picked out the glasses she wanted she said that she could see better when she was looking through my sample glasses than she could with just her contacts. I asked knew which glasses had which prescriptions in them so I picked out one of each, a -.50 a -.75 and a -1.00 pair and asked her which one she could see the best wearing? She went back and forth a bit before finally saying the -.75 seemed to be perfect. So I ordered her glasses with what she wanted -2.50 lenses. After her glasses came in she was soon only wearing her glasses and not her contacts. I commented one night to her that I thought she looked really good wearing glasses but I was surprised that she wasn't wearing her contacts more often. She only said that she really liked her glasses and that they were very comfortable to wear and that she could see better wearing her glasses than her glasses. I figured it out then that her eyes probably had adjusted to her glasses and now her contacts were too weak for her eyes. After about 6 or 7 months with only seeing her wearing glasses I was surprised to see her not wearing her glasses one evening. I was afraid that she may have broken her glasses so I asked her where her glasses were? She told me that she had her eyes examined and she got new contacts. She said that she also needs to get new glasses if I don't mind meeting with her again so she can pick something out? When we met again she didn't take nearly as long with picking out the glasses she wanted this time. She told me that her new prescription was now -2.75. She said that her doctor was surprised that her eyes had changed so much in less than a year. But said it probably a growth spurt that caused the change. When she was finished she leaned over and asked if I could increase her glasses like I did before? She claimed again that as she was trying on my samples she noticed an improvement in her vision. I smiled at her and said okay but maybe this time only -.50 more? she was okay with that. This time she was a little bit better about switching between wearing her glasses and contacts more equally. She did this several more times before she changed jobs and I only saw her once after that. The last glasses I ordered for her were -4.25. To this day I don't know if she was intentionally inducing myopia or just liked how wearing stronger glasses felt to her eyes.               </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2018, 08:06</p><p>Antonio, </p><p> </p><p>Did you try to induce more myopia at any point in your life? I see people aiming for some extreme prescriptions here. I personally want to settle somewhere around -1.50 and definitely don't want to go above -3.00. My goal is to be mildly myopic so that I can alternate between nearsighted and corrected vision as I please, not to be dependent on glasses or contacts all the time.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Antonio</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2018, 08:03</p><p>Hi denden, </p><p> </p><p>I don't think it's of any use for your goal to wear them while sleeping. I guess it's much more healthy to give your eyes a rest from contacts during the night, right. </p><p> </p><p>My eyes tend to get worse on their own over time. I started with -1.5 at 14 and now recently reached -7.5 -0.5 asti. I hope they don't get any worse, but they usually do, perhaps I loose  or gain :-) one diopter per decade ?  </p><p>:-) </p><p> </p><p>Best regards  sntonio. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2018, 07:46</p><p>Antonio, </p><p> </p><p>I am 23 years old. My target prescription is a minimum of -0.50 increase in both eyes, although ideally I'd like at least -1.50 in both. My current prescription is: </p><p> </p><p>R -0.75 SPH -0.25 CYL 170  </p><p>L -0.25 SPH -0.50 CYL 170 </p><p> </p><p>I omit the CYL in my right eye when ordering glasses because I never had astigmatism in my right eye until my last eye test so I'm not sure how accurate that is. </p><p> </p><p>Currently I am wearing R -2.75 L -2.50 daily contact lenses full-time. I also ordered R -2.00 L -1.50 -0.50 170 glasses to use when, for whatever reason, I can't wear my contacts. After I finish my current pack, I will switch to R -3.50 L 3.25 contacts for 6 weeks. I ordered Acuvue Oasys contacts which have been approved for a week-long overnight wear. Although wearing contacts overnight isn't ideal, it is currently the only sustainable way of being overcorrected 24/7 in my circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>How about you?

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;24 Feb 2018, 05:35</p><p>Soundmanpt &amp; Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>You guys have been frequenting this forum for a very long time. I skimmed through the old posts for a bit looking for some success stories. I really need to hear some because, as you can imagine, wearing minus lenses for long enough to induce myopia requires a certain amount of commitment.  </p><p> </p><p>I already know about 'GoldenMan' who wanted to evade military service in Iran so he used massively overcorrecting lenses. His story is indeed inspiring, but are there any others who had success with inducing myopia here in Eyescene? Especially those with a similar starting position to mine or MROP's (i.e. in their 20s and with little to no initial myopia).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2018, 15:53</p><p>MROP </p><p>Well your only a few days away from getting your eyes examined . I know that you have really been pushing your eyes very hard trying to induce some myopia. Your eyesight clearly isn't as good as it was back in October. your eyesight has deteriorated some since then for sure. The question is how much? what prescription will you be given for glasses? You admit that your going to need glasses for driving at night now. But I think your under estimating your eyesight. I think that your eyes have just gotten so used to seeing everything with such strong glasses and contacts that when you aren't wearing anything you think what your seeing is nearly perfect vision when in fact it probably isn't as perfect as you think it is. But continue pushing yourself like you have been and in a few says we will both know.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2018, 15:52</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Yes I included the CYL in my order of glasses. I am thinking of ordering -3.50/-3.25 for my next set of contacts. Do you think I will tolerate the -0.75 increase well? </p><p> </p><p>Last night I went to the supermarket without wearing any overcorrection. My vision was more blurry than usual, both outside and inside the supermarket. I tried to focus my eyes to see even blurrier (and they've been trained to simulate around -2.50 with contacts so that's a breeze now) but even when I relaxed them, my vision was blurry. I am guessing that I had the equivalent of -1.25 / -0.75 vision last night.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;23 Feb 2018, 08:57</p><p>denden </p><p>Most of the on-line sites get your glasses to you within 14 days I have been using Zenni for about 15 years and they seem to get better and faster all the time. Now I get my orders usually within 9 or 10 days. But i'm certain that your glasses will arrive at some point soon. Until then you at least have your contacts to wear and wearing them is just as good as wearing over correcting glasses. Your eyes seem to be fine with being over corrected if you're able to wear your -2.75 / -2.50 contacts all day comfortably enough that you completely forget that your even wearing over correction except for your eyes drying out. I assume that you have drops to help with your dry eyes? Of course your eyes being dry has nothing to do with over correcting. I'm sure the same thing would happen if you were only wearing your actual prescription contacts. So over the past week or so have you been able to do everything you normally do wearing over correction, such as driving a car and going to school or work etc? You have only been over correcting your eyes for a short time. It would seem that if you're already seeing normal with this amount of over correction your eyes are probably ready for another increase either with your contacts or with glasses. You probably need to make the increases in your contacts if you have any fear that your partner might notice a difference in your glasses or your glasses lenses.  </p><p>When you ordered your glasses did you include your astigmatism correction in them? Increasing SPH helps to compensate for a lack of CYL in your contacts but it doesn't mean your eyesight will be completely perfect. In fact ECP's  (eye care professionals) will tell you that your vision won't be as clear doing that but usually acceptable. I look forward to hearing any updates.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;22 Feb 2018, 09:54</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>My glasses are still being prepared. I've been checking their status every day and it hasn't changed for 5 days now. Wearing my contacts full-time, I became very comfortable with the overcorrection. I genuinely forget that I'm wearing overcorrection nowadays, but the contacts themselves become dry towards the end of the day.  </p><p> </p><p>When I take out my contacts, I try to maintain the blur as long as possible. I can do that for around 5-10 minutes but then my eyes relax. Not sure if this is Pseudo Myopia, since I still need to actively try not to relax my eyes after taking out the contacts.  </p><p> </p><p>I can't wait to supplement my contacts with my new glasses once they arrive. They aren't as strong as my contacts but it's certainly better to wear some overcorrection than none at all if I have to take out my contacts in the evening. </p><p> </p><p>One thing I noticed is that my left eye struggles more with the overcorrection at times. Both the distance and near vision in my left eye is compromised compared to my right eye which sees crystal clear with the contacts. This is likely due to the -0.50 CYL in my left eye. Listening to my optometrist, I added -0.25 SPH in my left eye contacts to combat the CYL, but not sure if this actually did the trick. Should I order my next set of contacts with the additional SPH for astigmatism? (To make it clear, I use R -2.75 and L -2.50 at the moment, and if I decided to omit the additional SPH for astigmatism, my contacts would be R -2.75 and L -2.25).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;21 Feb 2018, 18:09</p><p>denden </p><p>Are you still waiting for your glasses to arrive? Many of the on line sites will send you an e-mail indicating that your glasses have shipped. Have you received that yet? Anyway I assume that your wearing your contacts on a full time daily basis. How are you doing with that? I mean how are you seeing wearing them? By now your eyes should be pretty well adjusted to them and you should be seeing everything nice and clearly.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Antonio</b>&nbsp;18 Feb 2018, 13:57</p><p>Wow MROP. Interesting sleep and awakening :-) </p><p> </p><p>Have you already tried to read the board bareeyed at uni above your glasses ? </p><p> </p><p>Still possible ? :-) </p><p> </p><p>Best regards, antonio</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>EyeTri</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2018, 12:17</p><p>MROP, </p><p> </p><p>If the frame of the glasses you slept in is a quality frame, fits well and is in good condition I wouldn't worry about sleeping in them. </p><p> </p><p>I have a life-long habit of reading in bed before going to sleep. Probably 3 or 4 nights each week I fall asleep with my glasses on and wake up 6 or 7 hours later with my glasses still on. This has been true for the last 7 or 8 years. At first I was a little concerned, but it has never hurt me or the glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I don't think sleeping in those glasses will do much towards helping you reach your goal, but I wouldn't worry much about doing it either.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2018, 08:45</p><p>MROP </p><p>I had to go back to find your first comments in here because I remember you first came in under a different name. "Molly Roger" So I am going to assume your name is Molly? Anyway Molly I know that you're trying everything possible to induce myopia and that your hoping to be prescribed with your first ever prescription for glasses on Feb 28th. And I have preached to you numerous times the importance of wearing your glasses / contacts constantly to get the results you're wanting. But you only need to wear over correction when your eyes are open. There is no point in wearing your glasses to bed because your room should be quite dark so your eyes shouldn't be able to focus on anything anyway with or without your glasses. Sleeping with your glasses could easily result in your glasses getting broke. But worse yet the frame could break and cut your face or even worse cut your eye. You want to be nearsighted not blind in one eye. If your wearing over correction for 16 or more hours a day that should be more than enough to change your eyesight.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2018, 08:17</p><p>MROP, </p><p> </p><p>Whoa! Not sure how safe that is tho tbh. Perhaps you could get night &amp; day contacts that can be worn to bed? Even that isn't ideal but it should be fine as long as you take them off once in a while. In high school when I was simulating myopia with plus contacts, I left them in sometimes because I wanted to see what it is like to wake up nearsighted. It was really nice and I didn't have problems apart from having to use refreshing eyedrops once a day.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;17 Feb 2018, 03:55</p><p>Denden/Soundmanpt,  </p><p> </p><p>So last night I tried something new and it worked well. I got my -3.50 glasses that I no longer wear, and wore them to bed. I slept in them. I did this as I wake up a lot in the night and without correction, worried itll have an adverse affect on what Im trying to do. Anyway this worked perfectly. It wasnt uncomfortable and when i did wake up, I was looking through some -3.50 lenses! It gave me a bit of a thrill to be honest! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2018, 08:53</p><p>Here are two paragraphs from "How to Study for an Eye Exam" that you might find helpful to prevent the situation MROP described below. </p><p>When examiner has completed checking both eyes, he/she will open the shutters and you will likely see two separate images.  This is intentional. This part of the exam is to check your muscle balance using some prisms that can separate the images both Horizontally and Vertically.  ECP will probably ask you to tell him when the two images are aligned Horizontally and then Vertically.   </p><p>While the images are separated, YOU have a very important check to make.  Compare the sharpness of the two images.  If they are not equally sharp, be sure and tell the ECP which image is clearer.  If there is a difference, the examiner will likely reduce the sharpness of the clearest image until they match.  The important thing at this point is that they match.  That lack of sharpness will be corrected in the next phase with both eyes working together. </p><p>You might find "How to Study . . . " helpful on your next eye exam. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2018, 04:30</p><p>Denden, </p><p> </p><p>Oh okay! Ill answer Red then! Im going to be fairly honest but with things like that Im going to try and change it a little. In my last exam I remember the optometrist doing the duochrome test with both eyes.  </p><p> </p><p>Im excited to go through my eye test and hopefully get a real prescription at the end. Im sure theyll tell me to wear glasses just for driving at night but the goal is to eventually be told that Id benefit from constant wear, so Im going to keep going until hopefully that point!  </p><p> </p><p>Im browsing for my -6.00 glasses that I want to buy as we speak, exciting! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2018, 02:58</p><p>One side effect of my overcorrection is that I make many more spelling mistakes when typing! I'm normally known as a grammar nazi so this is all new to me. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2018, 02:57</p><p>MROP, </p><p> </p><p>You have a very impression accommodation (and dedication!). To be fair I initially thought I couldn't handle any overcorrection but I'm fine with my current one, although I'm already experiencing problems with near vision and fatigue. It doesn't help that nowadays I'm having a fibromyalgia flare up which leaves me unable to focus. </p><p> </p><p>In the duochrome test, the optometrist will ask you to compare the clarity of the letters on the green and the red side. If the letters of the green side are clearer +0.25 D sphere is added and if the letters on the red side are clearer -0.25 D sphere is added. With optimal spherical correction, the letters on the red and green halves of the chart appear equally clear.  </p><p> </p><p>Therefore, if you want the doctor to add more minus than you need, you need to say that 'the red is clearer' even if they appear equally clear. Also, optometrists in the UK are trained to ask "does this lens make things clearer, or just a bit darker?" when you appear unsure. Saying the lens makes it clearer even though it's merely making the letters darker is another way to trick your optometrist to overcorrect you.  </p><p> </p><p>One risk with this strategy is that your optometrist may only apply these tests on one eye, so you will end up with one overcorrected and one properly (or under) corrected eye. In my first year of uni, I took a free eye test in Specsavers and I tried to implement this tactic. I ended up with a R -0.75 SPH L -0.75 SPH -0.25 CYL 170 prescription. As it turned out, my strategy only worked with my left eye, whereas my right eye was properly corrected. Knowing very well that my right eye is worse than my left eye, I ignored this prescription. </p><p> </p><p>If you want your progress to be measured appropriately with this eye test, then I'd suggest answering everything truthfully without second guessing yourself. However, if your primary concern is having a prescription to show your friends/family to prove that you need glasses, then try to make the optometrist add more minus.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;16 Feb 2018, 00:22</p><p>Denden.  </p><p> </p><p>Hey!  </p><p> </p><p>Im coping okay with my -6.00 lenses. Id say this is the first prescription that my eyes are taking time to get used to. My phone is about 6 inches from my face to read super clearly however Im holding it closer than this as I can just make out words, and want to push my eyes as much as possible.  </p><p> </p><p>Im completely comfortable with me -5.00 glasses do I guess thats my limit when it comes to complete accommodation however its getting better everyday, so my eyes are getting used to -6.00. Im trying to squint as much as possible even when wearing my contacts or glasses and Im limiting how much I look in the distance when I dont need to!  </p><p> </p><p>Im hoping my eye exam will be fine. Im not sure how to answer some questions. I know with red and green I say that green is clearer, yes? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2018, 12:46</p><p>denden </p><p>Okay I was wondering if her knew that you wear contacts. Otherwise he could easily see the contacts in your eyes when he is close to you. An of course he has no way of knowing how strong your contacts are. So when your glasses arrive he is likely going to want to try your glasses on the first time he sees you wearing them. You should probably even warn him that they are a little stronger than your previous glasses. Simply tell him that your eyes got worse so you needed stronger glasses. Then you can either wear just your contacts or just your glasses or when your eyes are ready your glasses and contacts together.  </p><p>Great that he likes how you look wearing glasses. So that should make it very easy for you to wear your glasses full time as well.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2018, 12:32</p><p>MROP </p><p>I have been wondering about you. No doubt the Christmas break was a bit of a setback for you because you really weren't able to do continuous wear which is critical. I think, or at least hope, that you will get a little stronger prescription than -.50 for driving at night. Remember after wearing -6.00 between glasses and contacts when you you're not wearing anything your eyes probably feel like they are seeing perfect when their really not. You could actually be closer to -1.00 or -1.25 even. But even if you somehow only get prescribed -.50 that's better than what you were a few months ago. Back then you could drive night or day perfectly without glasses. So no matter the outcome you should continues wearing over correction for a while longer. </p><p>Your eyes are sure to feel tired and fatigued after wearing so much over correction. But the strain is a good thing and means that your eyes are working hard to focus which can lead the blur you get. Getting booked late in the day is great and should give you plenty of til=me to read all whole day before you get your eyes examined. So yes good idea.     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2018, 12:02</p><p>MROP, </p><p> </p><p>Great to hear from you again! I am eagerly waiting for your eye tests results as I am curious to see how successful omeone in their 20s can be with this. I'm sure that your efforts will pay off and you will get at least -0.50/-0.75. Before you go, I recommend that you research how doctors try to determine whether their patients are overcorrected, so that you can circumvent these (such as the duochrome test). </p><p> </p><p>How are you coping with your -6.00 lenses? I'm wearing -2.50 / -2.75 lenses atm which overcorrect me by -2.00. I'm okay with them most of the time but today I was sleep deprived and lost focus a new times. I also struggled a lot when plucking my partner's eyebrows lol almost reached for some reading glasses if only I had any. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2018, 11:55</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>I told him that I went for an eye test to get contacts and that's why I've been wearing them recently. I didn't make a reference to any changes in my prescription.  </p><p> </p><p>He says even my current glasses give him a headache and he isn't too eager to try them on. He used to put them on randomly to take selfies but I think he lost interest now. Once he tested out how he sees with each individual eye and turned out that the left lens made a tiny improvement while the right lens made things smaller and harder to focus on. This is in line with his recent eye test results which were R 0 L -0.25 (the optometrist sent him off saying he had one of the best visions he even encountered lol).  </p><p> </p><p>I've already been wearing my glasses a lot around him and he says that they suit me. He even encourages me to wear them more because he doesn't want me to be deprived of the perfect vision he has unaided.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MROP</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2018, 11:49</p><p>Soundmanpt,  </p><p> </p><p>Hi, just thought Id update you. My eye exam is booked for 28th February so just under 2 weeks to go. Whilst Im sure Ill get prescribed -.50 glasses for nighttime driving (which is still an issue for me, Im pretty sure Ill always need glasses for driving at night now) the over Christmas period where I had to go without any overcorrection has meant that my eyesight in general during the day is barely different. I notice that things get more blurry when ai get tired and that my eyes are feeling strained looking in the distance, so Im wondering if theyre trying hard to accommodate and give up when Im more fatigued, hence the blur then.  </p><p> </p><p>Im not wearing -6.00 contacts regularly, and am ordering some glasses of ge same strength next week. In the meantime whilst I want to wear my glasses, I am wearing my -3.50 glasses over my -3.00 contacts. I also have a pair of -5.00 glasses that I wear on my own as Im not a fan of the style enough to wear around friends.  </p><p> </p><p>Im hoping that continuous wear of these contacts and or contacts/glasses combination will result in at least a little worsening of my eyesight before the exam. Ive booked it for late in the day and am free all day before so plan to spend all day doing some intense reading with as much overcorrection as possible. Im going to wear my contacts up until I leave for the exam, and then my glasses until I walk through the door. Good idea?  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2018, 10:07</p><p>denden </p><p>Okay now it makes more sense to me. If he has at tone time or another and actually wore your glasses for a short period of time which since your prescription is rather weak i'm sure he was able to see pretty well with your glasses on. And without a doubt when you get stronger glasses he is sure to want to try them on. Even though he has little interest in optics he is still going to notice the that your new glasses are a good bit stronger. I assume that you haven't shared with him any of your recent eye exam results? So You should tell him that you went for an eye exam and your eyesight has deteriorated a good bit and your new glasses are going to be stronger than your previous glasses. That will also provide you with why you're going to be wearing glasses much more often as well. You're probably right he is going to want to try your glasses when he sees them. But once he realizes that they are too strong for him to see anything wearing them he will return them to you rather quickly and not want to try them again. If you only ordered -2.00 / -1.50 -.50 170 glasses that's weaker then the contacts your eyes seem to have already adjusted to quite well. Are you planning on wearing contacts along with your glasses to increase the power a bit more. If you have an idea what prescription you want for your next glasses you shouldn't hold off with ordering them if you want to get the same frame so your partner won't notice any change. Many on-line sites sell surplus and over stock frames so their inventory is often limited.  </p><p>Even though your partner doesn't have any interest in optics,  is he going to be okay with you wearing glasses full time?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2018, 16:44</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>The only pair of glasses that I own are with my true prescription. Until now I have been overcorrecting with contacts only, and thankfully it never occurred to my partner that my contacts have a much higher prescription. I can easily get away with wearing my overcorrecting contacts around him but glasses will be more difficult. </p><p> </p><p>I just ordered R -2.00 SPH / L -1.50 SPH -0.50 CYL 170 glasses from selectspecs.com. This is not a dramatic jump so I don't think he will notice it that much even if he tries them on. He lacks an interest in optics so I don't think he will ask to try them more than once. That way, I can get away with getting even stronger glasses within the same frames after some time passes. </p><p> </p><p>I never considered coming clean to him and I don't think he would take it well. He'd probably think I'm crazy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2018, 15:52</p><p>denden </p><p>Everything you have been told by your optometrist is true. Also, it's fairly common for astigmatisms to fluctuate from one exam to the next and it is very difficult for your optometrists to get it perfect as well. So i would say all of your recent eye exams have been dead on. I'm not at all surprised that with your -.75 / -.50 contacts your vision is 20/15. Their are 2 reasons that it's so good. First because contacts are sitting directly on your corneas compared to your glasses that sit about 3/4" in front of your eyes. It;s only a alight difference but enough to make a slight difference. Also going up -.25 in SPH in your left eye is sure to make a slight difference as well. Now even though you're able to see the 20/15 line on the eye chart your vision might still be a little bit fuzzy compared to your glasses. I agree your CYL is likely closer to being -.50 than -.25. If it was closer to -.25 I think your doctor would have simply ignored your CYL in that eye. Most doctors if your CYL is -.50 will take half of that value and add it to your SPH.  </p><p>I'm sure that your partner even though he doesn't know anything about optics can easily tell the difference between your prescribed glasses and your -2.75 / -2.25 glasses. How have you managed so far with him not catching you wearing stronger glasses? Trying to induce when you're with someone and you don't want to tell or for them to find out what you're up to is very difficult. Have you considered just telling him the truth that you think your glasses look too weak and you really want your glasses to look like their strong enough to be worn all the time.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2018, 10:29</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>To be clear, this is my current glasses prescription (obtained in December 2016): </p><p> </p><p>R -0.75 SPH </p><p>L -0.25 SPH -0.25 CYL 180 Ax </p><p> </p><p>A recent (January 2018) eye test gave the following result but I decided to ignore it because it doesn't make much sense to me: </p><p> </p><p>R -0.75 SPH -0.25 CYL 170 Ax </p><p>L -0.25 SPH -0.50 CYL 170 Ax </p><p> </p><p>I told my optometrist that I wanted to wear contact lenses sometimes, and he said that my contacts prescription is: </p><p> </p><p>R -0.75 SPH </p><p>L -0.50 SPH </p><p> </p><p>When I went for a check up last week, I had 20/15 vision with these contacts on.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2018, 10:14</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>I can't find frames identical to my current ones online so I'll have to order a different one. I'm lucky in that my partner doesn't have a good understanding of refractive errors, for example he doesn't understand what -2.75 means. However, I think he is able to tell the jump from -0.75/-0.25 glasses to -2.75/-2.25 if he puts them on himself. With my current glasses he sees well but they give him a headache if he keeps them on for long (he is R Plano L -0.25). </p><p> </p><p>My astigmatism diagnosis fluctuates between -0.50 and -0.25 in each eye test. The axis is more or less consistent. I keep the CYL at -0.25 to err on the side of caution but I think it is more likely -0.50 as that is what I always get from the autorefractor. I never bothered with toric lenses as they don't cater for CYL below -0.75 anyway. My optometrist said that the astigmatism in my left eye can be catered for my adding an extra -0.25 SPH. Do you know why that works?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2018, 09:25</p><p>denden </p><p>It's very normal if you're going to have any problem wearing over correction it wouldn't the distance that will bother you but your close up eyesight will notice it more. So at first things like reading plucking your eyebrows and applying eye makeup will be more difficult but the more you wear the over correction the more your eyes will adjust for close up things. The only way you could get away with wearing stronger glasses would be to order the exact same frame as your as your -2.75  / -2.50 glasses. Your partner has by now already tried on your current glasses so he /she shouldn't have any reason to want to try your glasses on again if they appear to be the same.  </p><p>By the way if you decide to order contacts it would be abetter idea to only get your contacts with SPH and no CYL. You should always get CYL put  into your glasses because it doesn't cost extra in your glasses. Your CYL is so low you should be able to ignore it anyway. The extra strength of your glasses should more than compensate for the lack of such a small amount of CYL. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2018, 07:22</p><p>Cactus Jack &amp; Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>I am wearing my overcorrection (R -2.75 L -2.50) from my morning shower to just before bed. I am very comfortable with them in the daily course of life except when I need to do some grooming (such as plucking eyebrows or applying eye makeup). I will continue this routine until my current supply runs out and then I am considering to order R -3.50 L -3.25 night &amp; day contacts as well as glasses with R -2.00 SPH L -1.50 SPH -0.25 CYL 180 Ax lenses. Although I would love to order stronger glasses, it would be difficult to explain to my partner why my new glasses appear to be much stronger than my old ones when he (inevitably) tries them on.  </p><p> </p><p>Last Sunday I took a break from contacts because my eyes felt dry. I wore my -0.75 /-0.25 glasses full-time instead. During the day my vision was perfectly fine with them, although not as crisp as my overcorrected vision. At night, I was seeing halos around lights even with my glasses on and some street signs were not legible. It's great to see some Pseudo Myopia kick in already!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2018, 20:06</p><p>denden, </p><p>Keep wearing over correction and increase it a little.  That should work until you are in your 40s. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2018, 15:32</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>Let's say I add -0.75 Pseudo Myopia to my prescription by wearing overcorrection for so long. What can I do to make sure it stays that way? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2018, 12:32</p><p>denden, </p><p>I don't think a "Myopia Gene" has ever been identified there could be several involved. </p><p>I know of several families where the children are Myopic or Hyperopic and the parents are neither.  The study of trait inheritance by Gregor Mendel is interesting.  His pioneering work is what we now call Genetics and is the foundation of the science. </p><p>Lots of people who have had Myopia or Hyperopia for many years discover in later life that not all of it is Axial in nature and some of it is either Pseudo Myopia or Latent Hyperopia.   </p><p>Don't discount the value of Pseudo Myopia in needing significant MINUS in corrective lenses. It is still Myopia and your distance vision is still blurry without your glasses.  You have to be patient. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2018, 09:58</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for your explanation. Genetically it is good news that the Myopia gene is likely to be recessive. As I said before, my parents are a mere -0.50 but there are many prescriptions over -3.00 on my paternal side. Almost all my paternal uncles and aunts are nearsighted, and many of my cousins as well. On my maternal side, it's doesn't look as good. Having tried on their distance glasses, my maternal grandma and aunt seem to have Hyperopia and Astigmatism. Although they don't seem to understand refractive errors that well, they complain that their distance vision deteriorated due to age (which makes me think they are lifetime Hyperopes who never got diagnosed until Presbyopia kicked in). </p><p> </p><p>I actually used a DNA kit recently so I might find out for sure if I have the myopia gene (not sure if they test for that tho, I know they test for macular degeneration which I would NOT like to have).  </p><p> </p><p>It is true that I would prefer knowing if I have any chance of inducing any Axial Myopia so that I don't waste my time and effort with overcorrecting minus lenses. I know that you can't guarantee that for me, so I am willing to take the risk for 6 months. If I see no progression whatsoever, then I will go back to wearing my true prescription.  </p><p> </p><p>I suspect even my 'true' prescription may be -0.25 more than what I actually need. The autorefractor typically gives out R -0.50 SPH L -0.50 CYL 180 on my eyes, and when the optometrist asks "Are the letters clearer with this lens, or just a bit darker?" I know that is code for "Is this more minus than you need?" so I tend to answer with "the letters are clearer". Also with the red-green test I try to answer the way that would make the optometrist add extra minus. That said, next time I go for an eye test to measure my progress, I will refrain from answering in ways that will prompt the optometrist to overcorrect me, not matter how tempting that is.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2018, 08:03</p><p>denden, </p><p>The biggest difference between becoming more Myopic "naturally" and Inducing Myopia is the time period over which it happens.  Natural Myopia occurs over many years often starting in childhood and continuing into the mid 20s.  There is often a genetic component to Axial Myopia which MAY be triggered/encouraged by focusing close. </p><p>Most babies are born with Hyperopia because their eyeballs are small to dit in their eyesocktets.  Fortunately, they are usually equipped with very flexible Crystalline Lenses that have a very large accommodation range.  It takes about a month for a baby to learn how to use their Ciliary Muscles to squeeze their Crystalline Lenses to focus close with little apparent effort.  That is why you see young children happily coloring with their eyes very close to the page.  It may be very beneficial in vision development. </p><p>Some years ago there was some research done at Johns Hopkins University into the cause of failure of some peoples eyeballs to grow normally.  They are very Hyperopic.  It is believed that there is a specific Eyeball Growth Hormone produced by the Retina, but it has not, to my knowledge been isolated or identified. </p><p>There was some research many years ago where baby chicks were fitted with minus glasses.  They grew into adulthood being Myopic and requiring minus glasses to have normal distance vision. </p><p>There are instances where children are born very Myopic to parent who are not themselves Myopic.  If you look into their family history of Myopia, you find that there are grandparents or aunts or uncles who are Myopic.  This is beyond my pay grade, but it appears that extreme eyeball growth may be controlled by a recessive gene. If both parents carry a recessive gene, it can become active and some of their children may be extremely Myopic at a very young age, sometimes dangerously so. </p><p>People who want to induce Myopia typically want it to occur over a period of weeks or months.  If you do not have significant Presbyopia, you can Induce Pseudo Myopia almost instantly by wearing glasses or contacts that have more MINUS than you actually need.  What happens is that your Auto-Focus mechanism in your eyes (Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses) will add enough PLUS to compensate fo the excess MINUS.  The problem is that when you take off the glasses or contacts with the excess MINUS, your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses will quickly relax back to minimum PLUS power.  It is no different than reading something at 30 cm and then looking at a distant scene.  Your eye change focus almost instantly. </p><p>However, if you wear significant over correction for an extended period, your Ciliary Muscles will have difficulty relaxing.  If you do that enough and for long enough, when you take your glasses off, distant objects will be blurry until your Ciliary Muscles relax.  That can be a surprisingly long time.  Until they fully relax, you will, for all intents and purposes, be Myopic. </p><p>Pseudo Myopia and Latent Hyperopia are EXACTLY the same phenomenon.  If a person is Hyperopic and have corrected their Hyperopia internally for many years, they will often experience what is apparently increasing Hyperopia. when they start wearing PLUS glasses.  What is happening is that the PLUS glasses are supplying some of the focusing power they need, externally, and their Ciliary Muscles will begin to slowly relax.  As they happens, sometimes over a period of months, they will need more and more PLUSin their glasses until their Ciliary Muscles completely relax.  At that point their vision will stabilize and they will probably not need much increase. </p><p>Pseudo Myopia can happen naturally over many years of eye exams where a person choses stronger MINUS in their glasses at each exam.  Around age 40 when Presbyopia starts sneaking up on them, they will often experience a reduction in their MINUS prescription and their Pseudo Myopia.  If there is underlying Axial Myopia, it will not change very much, if at all. </p><p>I would urge you to do some detailed research on vision and how it develops to understand this better.  It takes a while to get your mind around how this works, but he math is pretty easy.  I believe you have fundamentally asked the same question repeatedly, hoping for a different answer that you want to hear.  It is a common technique used in the courtroom.  In this case, we are dealing with the laws of Optics and Physics which have been in existence since the Big Bang and applied to life for quite some time.  There have been requests for changes to those laws, but so far there has been no response. </p><p>C.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2018, 13:30</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>So what is the difference between becoming myopic naturally vs inducing it? I thought the logic behind overcorrecting was to force the eye to use the ciliary muscles more, even when looking at the distance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2018, 10:49</p><p>denden </p><p>Yes theirs a big difference in becoming myopic naturally and inducing it. Wearing over correction for 8 hours your eyes do of course adjust to the power of your glasses. But if you take the glasses off and go back to wearing your normal prescription glasses or no glasses at all your eyes refocus back to their normal state after a few minutes time. You want your eyes to constantly only be seeing through stronger lenses. It's the constant over correction that is changing your eyes.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;12 Feb 2018, 06:10</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>Could you explain more why it defeats the purpose if you only wear overcorrection 8 hours per day? People who become myopic naturally don't focus on nearby objects nonstop so surely it is possible to become myopic if your eyes are strained 8 hours per day? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2018, 12:37</p><p>Michael, </p><p>There are two kinds of Myopia, both require correction with - lenses.  As Soundmanpt said, you are probably too old to be able to induce any Axial or True Myopia, but you may be a good candidate for inducing Pseudo or False Myopia. </p><p>Axial or True Myopia is caused by a mismatch between the Total PLUS power of your eye's lens system and the length of your eyeball.  It is considered Permanent. Pseudo Myopia is caused by your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses having trouble relaxing back to minimal Plus power after doing a lot of close work or having compensated for more Minus in corrective lenses than you actually need.  Pseudo Myopia is considered to be Temporary, but don't be put off by that term.  Temporary can be a long time (years) if you nurture it. </p><p>It is very hard, even for Eye Care Professionals (ECPs), to tell if your Myopia is True or False without really extensive testing, but that is not very important, because both need the same type of correction.  The first step is, as Soundmanpt suggested, to get some glasses that are a bit stronger than prescribed, with a frame as near as possible to your present frame.  The reason for not changing the frame is that most people do not notice the difference in lens power, but they will notice a change in frame.  In some ways is it like changing your hair style, or getting new clothes. </p><p>Wear the glasses as much as possible, particularly when doing close work.  When the stronger glasses get very comfortable, then get some glasses that are say,R -2.00 / L -2.25.  In fact you might consider ordering both pair at the same time, with identical frames from an online retailer such as Zenni Optical, so they will be available when you are ready.  Then when those get comfortable go to R -3.00 / L -3.25. </p><p>It takes time to build up the strength of your Ciliary (focusing) Muscles and get them accustomed to not fully relaxing, but it will probably happen. </p><p>There are a few practical things you will need to do, but you need to get started on this as soon as possible.  One important thing, is that if you decide to check your progress by getting another eye exam, wear you prescribed glasses If you go to the ECP that did your last Official exam. </p><p>One thing to understand is that Vision actually occurs in the brain.  Your eyes are just Biological Cameras.  Your brain has amazing ability to correct slightly blurry images, IF it knows what something is supposed to look like. In fact, your brain can produce images without any input.  Ever had a dream? </p><p>When you get glasses, you should wear them full time for 10 days to 2 weeks.  It takes that long for your brain to learn that is does not need to expend the effort to correct blurry images.  Then is when you will notice that distant signs are blurry without your glasses, particularly at night. </p><p>Hope this helps. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2018, 11:21</p><p>Ginny </p><p>Actually I just saw her yesterday in fact. Like I said she only works at the sports bar on Saturdays and even she doesn't know until they post the schedule on Sunday afternoon if she is working the morning shift or the night shift. I happened to be at the bar on Thursday so I asked my server which shift she was working yesterday. She was the only server working and she wasn't busy so she came over and talked to me. I wasn't going to say anything to her about getting her eyes examined. But she right away told me that her bf isn't working because he does landscaping and the weather has been bad so he can't work until the weather gets better. The problem is she has vision insurance and he doesn't. So it was my idea for her to go where I have sent others to get eye exams for only $35.00. but I noticed they have a different doctor working their now and I don't know if they will still do that or not. but it would help if she got her eye exam using her insurance and they might be more willing to do his for the $35.00. I think I might stop in at the optical store anyway and ask if they are still doing the $35.00 eye exams for people without insurance? </p><p>She promised t e-mail me and let me know which shift she works next Saturday. I think I will let her borrow the glasses she likes for the following week. That way she can test her eyes by wearing the glasses. Remember they have -.75 lenses in them. And remember she loves how she looks wearing theses glasses.  </p><p>I know moving isn't much fun. So i'm sure that you have been very busy with doing that. Have you started your new job yet?  </p><p>When you get stringer lenses in your glasses your eyes really do seem to enjoy the increase don't they? I assume that's why it can be a bit addictive. I'm sure you wouldn't mind getting your glasses changed again in a couple months would you? Sorry I don't think that is going to happen. Your eyes should be fine with your glasses just the way they are for a while now. but you will likely need an increase in about a year or so. Too bad your mom doesn't have a better memory about her glasses history. But at least you know that when she got her first substantial prescription of -2.00 she was the same age as you and your glasses are considerably stronger than her glasses were. Interesting so was she also like you in that before she got prescribed with -2.00 glasses she only had very weak glasses that she wore? That part sounds very much like you. Didn't you say that when her vision became stable her glasses were around -5.00 and she was around 30 years old? So if your eyes don't become stable until your 30 years old even with a small increase of -.50 per year you could easily be wearing around -6.00 to -7.00 glasses by then. Would that be okay with you? That extra -.75 increase in you glasses really seems to have made a difference in your ability to see without your glasses. Before you got this increase you seemed to be able to function pretty well without your glasses. Not perfect of course but good enough. Now you don't seem to be able to do anything without your glasses anymore. I'm not surprised that it's becoming harder for you to read without your glasses. Once anyone starts wearing their glasses full time their ability to read without glasses usually goes away and even more so if you keep your glasses on when reading because your eyes get adjusted to reading with small print with your glasses so it makes sense that after a while your eyes can't focus as well close up. I'm sure your eyes are much more comfortable now that your keeping your glasses on when reading in bed now. So the last thing you do before turning off your light is take off your glasses and put them on the night stand beside your bed and the first thing you do in the morning is put your glasses on. Now your truly a full time glasses wearer. But something tells me that you're loving every minute of it.         </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2018, 10:20</p><p>Michael </p><p>Honestly based on everything you say about your life style I don't think you stand much of a chance of inducing any real myopia. First problem is your age. You're probably about 9 years past an age where it would be possible. Next is as you already know wearing stronger glasses than your prescription calls for. And wearing them constantly. Wearing stronger glasses for 8 hours and then going without for just 30 minutes defeats everything you had done for those 8 hours.  </p><p>Now if you're just wanting your glasses to be stronger your eyes should be able to tolerate wearing stronger glasses and your eyes should be able to adjust to them okay as well. If your total prescription is R -.25 / L -.50 you might want to go on line to Zenni (zennioptical.com) and order yourself a pair of glasses with R -1.00 / L -1.25.   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

Even with the same BC different brands of CLs can have different levels of comfort. </p><p>If your contacts feel uncomfortable after several hours of wear, you need to take them out and let your Corneas rest. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2018, 18:16</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>Based on my past experimentations with soft contact lenses, the higher the BC is the more uncomfortable it feels. If I wore contacts with a BC of 8.3, would that still leave enough space between the contact and my cornea? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;08 Feb 2018, 14:35</p><p>denden, </p><p>Contact lenses are designed to float on a film of tears between the CL and your Cornea.  The Cornea does not have a blood supply, but gets its oxygen from the air and both oxygen, lubrication,  and nutrients from tears.  Lenses that fit too tightly do not allow the tear film to form and also do not move around as you blink, which helps the circulate the tears. </p><p>Often, when checking the fit of CLs the ECP will use a drop of Fluorescein, an Orange colored dye and check with a weak blue light for the dye between the CL and your Cornea. </p><p>Base Curve is a measurement of the curvature of the inside surface of the CL. It needs to be a little greater than the measured curvature of your cornea so tears can get between the CL and your Cornea.

Probably doesn't even realise how much her vision is compromised in daily life. </p><p> </p><p>I went to get my contact lens fit checked by my optometrist, wearing my 8.4 BC -0.50 / -0.75 lenses. He told me they seemed to fit really well on my eyes, but I asked him to measure my corneas with a machine just for a peace of mind. The machine gave the number 7.67 for both eyed and he said that makes 8.4 a perfect fit. I want to understand what these numbers may mean and how he concluded from them that 8.4 was my  perfect fit. Do you know how it works?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2018, 18:39</p><p>denden, </p><p>Mono vision can be annoying.   </p><p>Probably, because my eyes did not have to work as a team until I got glasses, I started having some serious headaches when I was in University and doing a lot of study for engineering.  I had an acquaintance a bit older than I was, but wore bifocals in classs for being to see the board and his notes easily.  I asked a school ECP about bifocals, but he refused to consider them for anyone under 40.  After I got out of school I started having trouble with headaches doing some very close work and saw a different ECP.  He suggested that I try what he called "Functional + 1 bifocals", not that I actually NEEDED them. (I think he said that in case I had some vanity issues).  I got them and no more headaches at work. There were a few comments, but the commenters were not having the headaches. Away from work, I wore single vision glasses. </p><p>A few years later I was in a training program that involved a lot of study and I started having headaches again and got some +1.50 bifocals and wore them full time at 26 because they were just convenient.  By the time I was 30 I was wearing +1.75 bifocals and involved in work that involved what are called "D" size drawings that are 22 x 24 inches.  I discovered that I could not read the text at the top of the drawings without almost climbing up on the drawing table.  Getting caught on the drawing table is a bit hard to explain so I found an ECP that would reluctantly prescribe trifocals for a 30 YO.  That solved that problem.  I went back to bifocals when I moved on from that job.  I switched to trifocals full time when I was 37 and have worn them since. </p><p>My point in all this, is that your friend with mono vision, might be having trouble with her eyes working as a team, and she might find reading glasses, functional bifocals, progressives or even trifocals, useful. at least for close work.  If I am doing a lot of very close work, I have some single vision reading glasses that are very comfortable. </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2018, 17:39</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>I remember you raised the possibility that my parents and I may merely have Pseudo Myopia. My mom is 50 and she had an eye test yesterday. Turns out that she is still -0.50 in both eyes and needs +1.00 for presbyopia. She absolutely hates glasses so she refused to get a pair until now even tho she obviously needed them for driving at night. My dad (54) is R -0.25 L -0.50 and he also uses his distance glasses at night. I almost never see him use reading glasses. </p><p> </p><p>The good news is their Myopia is most likely Axial and they must have passed it onto me. The bad news is our genes may be limiting us to -0.50, judging by the fact that we all studied Law and were bookworms as children.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2018, 17:15</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for giving me a bit of your history, it was indeed fascinating to read. I have a friend from law school who also has natural monovision (R -2.50 L P or -0.25) and yet she complains about struggling with both distance and reading.  </p><p> </p><p>I am originally from another country and I have a driving licence from there, just never had the opportunity/need to actually get a car. Back when I got it my prescription was R -0.50 L -0.25. The doctor did not put on my licence that I needed to wear correction but he still advised me to wear my spectacles at night. That said, the test was done in a sloppy way - I could have gotten away with it if I went in there with contacts. </p><p> </p><p>My reasons for desiring a stronger prescription are complex. In the beginning (when I was 12) it was just me wanting glasses for vanity purposes, but then it morphed into a strange fascination with distant things being blurry and putting on glasses or contacts to make them clear. I like being able to tune out of the outside world by taking off my glasses and putting them back on if I want to see clearly again. Also I like the look of minus lenses that are between -2 and -3.  </p><p> </p><p>I am wearing my overcorrecting contacts religiously now. Let's see where that takes me in 3 months!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2018, 16:22</p><p>denden, </p><p>I forgot to comment on the Plus contacts.  If you do a lot of reading, wearing Plus contacts has the same effect as wearing reading glasses of the same power.  They make close focusing easier, but they relieve your Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lens of some of their focusing work load. </p><p>C</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2018, 16:16</p><p>denden, </p><p>The reason I emphasize getting a driving license is that it is an acceptable way to get an official requirement for wearing glasses.  An official government  requirement for glasses or stronger glasses is magic for getting past all the questions about needing glasses.  I believe you said that you are in the UK.  I understand the "vision test" if being able to read a number plate from a certain distance is all that is required.  All you have to do is "flunk" that test with your glasses (or without) and you can't continue until that problem is solved.  The person administering the test does not know exactly how well you can read the number plate, only what you tell him/her. </p><p>I actually got a drivers license when I was 14.  I grew up in South Texas which is farming and ranching country. Lots of young teens had to help out with chores and duties.  Some involved driving trucks on the farm/ranch and it would be helpful if they could drive on the public roads.  If you could go before a judge and demonstrate that you had a need to drive to help the family, financially, and were a responsible young individual, the judge would authorize it, your family did not have to be directly involved in farming or ranching.  I had actually been driving farm machinery during the summers, on my grandfather's farm from he time I was about 8 or 9.  By the time I was 14 I had a small business going, fixing TVs and other Electronic Equipment. Mother got pretty tired of driving me around, so when I turned 14, my dad applied for an age exemption. I aced the written, but flunked the vision test and had to get glasses before I could take the practical test to get my driver's license.  </p><p>At that time, I had natural mono vision which was the reason I flunked.  Mono vision was not an acceptable condition at that time. Today, it is.  My first prescription was R Plano and L -1.50.  I did not understand exactly what that meant, but I knew that I was reading with my Left eye and using my Right eye for distance.  I really liked having 3 D vision with my glasses and was amazed at the sharpness seeing with both eyes. </p><p>I remember my next eye exam by an Ophthalmologist, because my mother insisted on it to make sure that there was nothing major wrong with my eyes,  That one resulted in a 0.25 increase in both eyes.  From then on I became very sensitive to my quality of vision and at the slightest distance blur, I would get an exam and new glasses.  The actual wearing of glasses became 2nd nature and fundamentally, no big deal as long as I was corrected to 20/20 or better,  The actual prescription was of no particular consequence.  Before i had cataract surgery my prescription was about R -2.75 L -4.50.  Note that the difference had not changed much from 14 to to about 64.  Until the cataracts developed, I was correctable to 20/20 or better with trifocals.  The actual prescription was of no real consequence.  The results are what counted. </p><p>To me, glasses are merely tools.  Not much different than other tools I use such as shoes, clothes, hammers, screwdrivers, etc.  I use tools because they make my life better and/or more convenient. </p><p>Please understand that I do not make judgements.  I fully understand the desire for the best possible vision.  When I was your age, I really looked forward to getting stronger glasses and the associated sharper vision.  One thing to remember is that 20/20 or 6/6 is "normal" vision, not necessarily the best possible human vision.  If you get a chance, look up the history of the Snellen fraction, what it means and how it was developed. </p><p>I would like to suggest that you need to screw up your courage.  I don't think you have ever said why you would like to wear stronger glasses.  It is not important and I don't really care other than wanting to see you NOT frustrated.  If you can ever get over the vanity hump (I suspect that it what it is), you will be able to do what ever you want to.  If you always get the same frame  you can gradually work your way up to a significant prescription and few people will even notice the increase or even ask any questions about it. </p><p>One thing I have noticed is that you seem to quickly find a reason for my suggestions not working in YOUR situation.  There are work arounds for almost any situation, except one, TIME.  You are wasting valuable time.  The longer you put off getting stronger glasses or lenses, the harder it will be to start wearing the glasses you want to wear. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2018, 14:15</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>Having had worse than 20/200 distance vision in the past, do you prefer having 20/30 vision? 20/30 is what I have atm without glasses, but I preferred it when I had 20/70 with my plus contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2018, 09:05</p><p>Karen </p><p>Actually I only wear readers. But I am certain that I have a cataract in my right eye. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2018, 08:33</p><p>denden, </p><p>Not particularly. I still need correction to see really well,  My vision without correction is about 20/30 because of mild astigmatism.  I can function pretty well without my glasses for many tasks, but if a lot of reading or precision work is required, I wear my glasses.  Either single vision for extensive reading or trifocals. </p><p>My biggest issue is esophoria.  I see double without my glasses much of the time.  I can fuse the images if I concentrate, but if I relax, my eyes will try to converge and I will see double.  If that happens and I am not doing something that requires near perfect vision, I just close one eye.  For driving, I wear glasses, alway. </p><p>For me, mono-vision is primarily a convenience.  If I need to get up at night, I don't need to put on my glasses to read a prescription bottle. I have a friend who had cataract surgery and opted for 20/20 distance vision in each eye including astigmatism correction (a supplemental procedure) and now he needs to find reading glasses for doing almost anything close such as reading or using the computer or smartphone.  I have suggested trifocals, but so far he has declined.  Trifocals are for "old" people, and he is only in his 70s.  I just smile while he fumbles for his "reading glasses".  </p><p>C. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;07 Feb 2018, 06:53</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>I remember you mentioned before that you opted for monovision in your cataract surgery. Do you miss your old myopic vision? Or do you prefer not needing correction to see well? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2018, 18:01</p><p>Yes I took a photography course in the past which certainly helped my understanding of vision. My myopia is much more pronounced at night, and I'm enjoying it! During day time, on the other hand, my left eye still has almost perfect vision (my right eye's a bit blurry). </p><p> </p><p>I don't have a car so the driving excuse won't work, but I will set the scene by occasionally complaining about not seeing distant objects well with my glasses/contacts on. Until it is the right time to get new frames I'll stick with contacts.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2018, 15:14</p><p>denden, </p><p>Congratulations.  Usually, blurring distance vision at night and in low light conditions is the first sign of needing a new prescription because of increasing Myopia.  Your efforts are beginning to pay off.  You have induced some myopia.  It is probably Pseudo Myopia, but accept any small gifts with appropriate thanks. </p><p>Have you ever done any photography with a high end camera with an adjustable Iris control?  Often these cameras have indicators on the lens that show the depth of field - range of useful focus - for a particular "f" stop or lens opening. The higher the "f" stop, the smaller the lens opening and the broader the depth of field.  The lower the "f"stop the wider the opening and the more narrow the depth of field. </p><p>You experience the same effect between bright light and dim light.  Your pupils contract in bright light, extending your range of useful focus and expand in dim light which reduces your range of useful focus. This is the perfect excuse for getting another pair of glasses for driving, particularly at night. </p><p>My suggestion is to order some glasses from Zenni with their lowest cost Anti-Reflective coating and start wearing them for driving at night.  You can conveniently forget to take them off.  If anyone asks, all you have to say is that you were having some problems reading small signs at night and your ECP suggested some driving glasses to see if that helped.  If there are further questions, you can say that you think you see better with them, even in bright light. </p><p>You can "break the ice" by commenting to no one in particular that you are having some trouble seeing at night with your new glasses. Then after two or three weeks appear with some stronger glasses. </p><p>Do your present glasses have an Anti-Reflective coating? </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Karen</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2018, 13:59</p><p>Soundmanpt, Having read your posts for some years, I am curious. Do you wear glasses? If so, what's your prescription? Have you been a life-long wearer or did you start more recently?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;06 Feb 2018, 05:23</p><p>Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>I do want to get overcorrecting glasses as well, but I only recently changed my frames so it may raise eyebrows if I get a new pair again now. Also I am afraid people may notice how strong my new glasses are compared to my old pair. </p><p> </p><p>Even after 1 week of overcorrection I am already noticing that my distance vision is becoming more blurry, especially at night! </p><p> </p><p>Following your advice, I will keep doing this until I work my way up to -3.25 / -3.50 contacts. How long do you think it will take me to induce (at least) some Pseudo Myopia if I keep overcorrecting 8 hours per day?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2018, 10:54</p><p>MROP </p><p>Were into Feb. So when is your appointment to get your eyes examined? You should be counting down the days. Do you notice much blur when you first wake up before you put on contacts or glasses? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>CactusJjack</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2018, 17:56</p><p>denden, </p><p>Maybe.  Glasses or contacts are equally effective as long as they have the same power and are worn all the time you are awake. It would be better if the glasses had the same prescription as the contacts.  Focusing as close as you can with your regular glasses is helpful. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>denden</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2018, 15:16</p><p>Can I still induced myopia if I wear my overcorrecting contacts for 8 hours per day? I can't tolerate wearing contacts any longer than that. I wear glasses with my real prescription after I take the contacts off and try to keep the computer screen as close to me as possible.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2018, 17:36</p><p>Johns, </p><p>Causes and Sources of pain are very difficult to determine, even for train medical personnel who have immediate physical access to the person experiencing the pain. </p><p>I doubt Corneal thickness was a factor.  The Cornea is very sensitive, It is possible that the pain was caused by something as benign as the solid remained of evaporated tears, such as the "sleep" you find in the corners of your eyes on awakening, becoming trapped between your eyelid and cornea.  If you rubbed your eyes under those circumstances, you would probably feel some pain. </p><p>Thanks for asking, but I have no idea what could have actually caused it.  I don't think the weak prescriptions had much to do with it.  If it was particles of dried tear component, tears would have dissolved them. </p><p>C.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Johns</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2018, 14:39</p><p>Hey Cactus Jack, </p><p> </p><p>I've had a question that I've been wondering about for a while. Before needing glasses when my vision was 20/20 if I rubbed my eyes I could rub the sides without discomfort but if i moved my finger over the front of my eyes I had pain. </p><p> </p><p> Then as a kid I got prescribed what should have been -0.25 glasses for my right eye only but they turned out -0.75 because of the opticians writing and I got used to them after only one day of them feeling too strong and with the newly acquired and permanent blurry vision the eye never hurt anymore when I rubbed it all over. But my left eye that was still perfect remained in discomfort, even years later with a -0.25 starting prescription but as soon as it got to -0.50 years later the pain stopped like with the right eye. </p><p> </p><p>What is the pain, was it just having a thin cornea when you have perfect vision but as you get more myopic it thickens up and the pain goes away?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;01 Feb 2018, 20:52</p><p>alex, </p><p>The is no way for a person to Induce Hyperopia.  Hyperopia occurs when there is a mismatch between the total PLUS power of the eye's lens system and the length of the eyeball.  Hyperopia is caused bt the eyeball not growing quite enough for the power of the eyes lens system.  To Induce Hyperopia, it would be necessary for the eyeball to SHRINK after it has grown to its present size.  That won't happen. </p><p>Lets talk a bit about Myopia and then I have a couple of questions. </p><p>There are two kinds of Myopia.  Axial or True Myopia is caused by as mismatch between the Total PLUS power of your eye's lens system and the length of your eyeballs.  Myopia means that your eyeballs are too long for the power of your eyes lens system.  it is considered permanent because eyeball growth is a one way trip. </p><p>Pseudo or False Myopia is caused by the Ciliary Muscles and Crystalline Lenses having trouble relaxing after adding extra PLUS to focus close or compensate for too much minus in contacts or glasses.  It is considered temporary, but temporary can be a long time if done properly.  It is also possible that Pseudo Myopia can lead to Axial Myopia, if started at an early age and it is done with a plan that maintains focusing stress. </p><p>Your asked how long it takes to Induce Myopia.?  How about 30 seconds if you do it right.  How long will it last?  Initially, about 10 seconds after you take off your over corrected glasses.  However, that can be changed. </p><p>I need to ask a few questions that I believe would be best answered, privately.  Please contact me at cactusjack1928@hotmail.com </p><p>C</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>alex</b>&nbsp;01 Feb 2018, 18:28</p><p>cactus jack </p><p> </p><p>Thank you very much for your answer. </p><p>I cant belive im actually hyperopic ,but I was relieved when you said I can still induce myopia it makes me rather happy.  </p><p>about astigmatism test . </p><p>lines around 12 and 6 are sharper and darker with both eyes which I believe means I have astigmatism. </p><p>I wanted to ask how long will it take to induce myopia with my current hyperopia and can I induce hyperopia if it takes really long to induce myopia? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cactus Jack</b>&nbsp;01 Feb 2018, 17:02</p><p>alex, </p><p>This may take a little thinking to get your mind around, but here goes. </p><p>Glasses or contact lenses are the opposite of your refractive error after adjusting for Vertex Distance effects. </p><p>If your refractive error was 0.00, the +1.50 readers would have resulted in a focal distance of 66.6 cm using the most fundamental formula of Optical Physics codified by Sir Isaac Newton over 300 years ago.  Focal distance = 1 meter / Lens Power in Diopters or 1 meter / Focal Distance = Len Power in Diopters.  In this example 100 cm/ 1.50 = 66.6 cm. </p><p>If your result is further away than 66.6 cm, your internal refractive error is MINUS, requiring a PLUS lens to correct. </p><p>If your result is closer than 66.6 cm, your internal refractive error is PLUS, requiring a MIUS lens to correct. </p><p>The results you got indicates that the effective power of the +1.50 readers were: </p><p>R 100 cm/ 85 cm = +1.18 diopters </p><p>L 100 cm/ 105 cm = +0.95 diopters </p><p>Your calculated refractive error would be the difference between the two: </p><p>R -0.32 </p><p>L  -0.55 </p><p>because your internal refractive error reduced the effective power of the OTC Readers by that much. </p><p>All this means is that you need to work a bit harder to Induce some Myopia.  It does not mean that it is impossible. </p><p>Some years ago, I had a client who badly wanted to wear minus glasses.  He had several eye exams that resulted in no prescription.  I asked him to perform the same test you did.  It turned out he was also mildly Hyperopic and was relating the symptoms for Myopia, which caused the examiner to look for Myopia, which the examiner did not find.  The result was no prescription. </p><p>Before continuing, I would ask you to follow this link for an Astigmatism chart: </p><p>https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct;=j&amp;q;=&amp;esrc;=s&amp;source;=images&amp;cd;=&amp;cad;=rja&amp;uact;=8&amp;ved;=0ahUKEwjh2O6v84XZAhWuq1kKHZAwD2kQjRwIBw&amp;url;=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.optoplus.com%2Fen%2Feye-health%2Fvirtual-eye-test%2Fvirtual-astigmatism-test%2F&amp;psig;=AOvVaw0NA01-4B3ZGHpCD1TP2W7r&amp;ust;=1517615213487258 </p><p>Look at the chart with each eye individually and notice if any of the spokes look blacker and sharper than the others.  If so, please let me know. </p><p>With that information, I may suggest an eye exam, with the appropriate complaints.  The idea is to get a prescription, but not order glasses at that time.  We will use the prescription to order glasses with MINUS sphere, but based on your actual prescription.   </p><p>Could this work, maybe.  In the situation I mentioned above, he started by ordering two pair of inexpensive glasses one with -1.00 and the other with -2.00 over correction. He worked up to -3.00 over and I suggested an exam by a different ECP wearing the -1.00 over, glasses.  He got his first official - glasses prescription.  I lost contact with him when he started University wearing -4.00 glasses. </p><p>Hope this helps some.  Don't even think of another exam until we talk some more. </p><p>C. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>
