She mentioned on a video "I got them just for reading a couple of years ago, but now it has become something that I can't live without". By looking at the video published date I found she must have started wearing reading glasses at the age of about 35. </p><p> </p><p>Can you find any info about others from the band who wear glasses? </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2018, 12:44</p><p>if you read earlier news about the spice girls, they all needed glasses from the start.  but not everyone wore glasses.  so nothing has changed.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2018, 17:41</p><p>Okay! since I started this by asking a simple question I certainly didn't mean to cause all this fuss. So I am sorry for saying I thought she had a Spanish accent. My mistake! I do thank Carrie and others for advising me where I cold find the pictures I was interested in. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;31 Jan 2018, 14:35</p><p>"Like most of us here?"   </p><p> </p><p>WOW.  How would you presume to know the ethnicity of the group here?  Might be a bit conceited, do you think?  This is a worldwide site.  Only Americans are typically dull enough to not recognize the difference in foreign accents.  Anyone from an Asian country sounds the same to them.  Anyone from a Spanish heritage country sounds the same to them. </p><p> </p><p>How about we pick an American with a strong redneck Southern drawl and say "that's how all Americans sound?"  Or all Americans sound like Doctor Who?  No?  They all speak English, right?  What's the problem? </p><p> </p><p>Do you get the point?  Open your ethnic eyes.  A Cuban accent is a Cuban accent.  It is not a Spanish accent.  People from Spain have a Spanish accent. </p><p> </p><p>  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2018, 17:04</p><p>Cubans speak Spanish but I presume the accent is slightly different than Spanish in Spain itself, like American English is similar but slightly different to British English. To someone who is neither Cuban or Spanish, like most of us here, her accent *sounds* Spanish. I believe many non-English speakers can't always work out if a speaker is English or American. Sometimes a native English speaker can be mistaken for a native German speaker to a non-English or German speaker! </p><p>(Sorry everyone for being off topic briefly)</p><p></p><hr>

Her prescription doesn't look very strong. She is Cuban, which explains the Spanish accent.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2017, 09:41</p><p>Pseldonymov </p><p>I couldn't agree with you more. In most pictures I have seen of her she doesn't look even slightly attractive. So seeing these 4 pictures of her looking this attractive is s nice surprise. And not just because she is wearing glasses. but even her choice of glasses are a nice look for her. They really showcase her eyes, In these pictures her eyes look amazing as well. She should stay with this kind of look all the time. She did look rather nice in a video I saw of her signing with Tony Bennet. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2017, 15:37</p><p>Pseldonymov </p><p>Thanks for posting the pictures of "Stefanie Joanne Angelina Germanotta" otherwise known as "lady Gaga" With a name that long it now makes sense why she goes by Lady Gaga. Anyway I have seen pictures of Gaga wearing glasses before but was never able to tell if they were prescription and if so what her glasses might be for or if they were just another part of some her often strange outfits. But the very first picture  when enlarged clearly shows some nice minification in the right lens of her glasses. So she is without a doubt nearsighted. She even looks quite attractive in these pictures and not just because she is wearing glasses, but even her glasses look very nice on her as well.  </p><p></p><hr>

Really hard to get any idea what her prescription might be since the pictures don't enlarge.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;13 Feb 2017, 16:28</p><p>Carrie </p><p>She looks really good wearing those glasses doesn't she? The glasses she is wearing looks like a pair of Art Craft or Shuron glasses. I have a very old pair that looks exactly like the ones she is wearing and they were made in 1941. They are in perfect condition and many things you don't see with glasses today. They are 14ct gold filled. The lenses are real glass. the nose pads are made from ivory. All the etching on the thin temples was done by hand. They have cable temples which you seldom see anymore. And the oddest part is that the prescription is just a +.25 in both eyes. This was during the war and I can't imagine why anyone would even prescribe anyone glasses for such a small prescription and the cost was probably more than a weeks pay in those days. I intend to keep them but I several years ago I did loan them to young lady that really loved them. She was an optician at a local optical store and her manager was getting on her because they had a rule that everyone working in the store had to wear glasses. She didn't need glasses and even worse she was very petite and she really was having a terrible time finding glasses that fit her small face. But my old glasses fit her perfectly and she since she loved them I agreed to let her borrow them to wear until she found glasses that fit her. It turned out she did order a pair the next week but as luck would have it they were on back order and they didn't come in for well over six weeks. When I went in to get my glasses back she tried hard to get me to sell them to her because she liked them that much. She wore them everyday she worked she said. She said they were comfortable and she soon hardly even noticed that she was wearing them. Her glasses looked very nice on her as well and she was good about wearing them at work. I'm sure your glasses must look really cute on you as well. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;20 Sep 2016, 09:10</p><p>Last night Ariana Grande was the musical guest on The Late Show with Jimmy Fallon and she was wearing a really nice looking pair of gold aviator glasses that looked really nice on her. I suppose that the reason she had glasses on was because she maybe had the lyrics to the new song she was singing on a monitor nearby. As soon as she finished the song she took her glasses off. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2016, 06:51</p><p>Was quite a sighting wasn't it Carrie, I'm glad you like it!  </p><p> </p><p>She sure was cute and geeky in a way and I certainly wouldn't say to no to her. With regard to Adele's language, it was dreadful and there was no need for her to use such uneducated language when she is such a role model for so many worldwide.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2016, 13:13</p><p>gwgs - I saw that live last night and I thought to myself how can Eyescene readers who aren't in the UK see that (The BBC's catch up website iPlayer doesn't work outside the UK). Thankfully someone (you?) recorded on something so it could be made available to everyone. Hopefully the BBC won't mind. I'm not a super-fan of Adele's but I do like a lot of her songs and I like her as a person. She seems genuinely friendly and down to earth. She just can't control her "potty mouth" when she's chatting. Apparently she swore 33 times during her performance (mostly the "F" word)! We were laughing so much we were crying and lost count of the "f"s! It was after 10pm so it didn't matter and BBC presenter did warn the tv audience beforehand that Adele might swear a bit. (I think I would swear if I walked on to a stage in front of thousands of people!) </p><p>There were quite a few attractive glasses wearing ladies in the crowds at the different stages and different times but only seen for a few seconds. I think it was during the performance by one of my favourite bands, Wolf Alice, a girl probably in her late teens was shown several times. She was wearing Wayfarer style glasses with a mild minus in one lens and a moderate minus in the other. I have watched the Wolf Alice performance back a few times but I can't remember during which song the girl was seen because I have watched performances by some of the other bands that played Glastonbury (thank you BBC!)and I might be getting the audiences mixed up. </p><p>I suppose these sightings should go in the "Sightings" section because it wasn't the musicians wearing glasses but members of the audience. I don't know if any female musicians wore glasses during Glastonbury.</p><p></p><hr>

A few years ago she tried on a British tv presenter's glasses and she said they were the same prescription as hers when the presenter told her his prescription.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;08 Mar 2016, 08:38</p><p>gwgs </p><p>I don't recall seeing any pictures before of Beyonce wearing glasses so a nice find indeed. Not only is she wearing glasses but her glasses look like they are quite necessary as well. She appears to have a fairly decent prescription based on what you can see through the left lens of her glasses. So she is clearly not wearing fake glasses just to keep from being recognized. Not surprising that she looks as good wearing glasses though. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2016, 10:48</p><p>Something I did some research on and found to be interesting. Musician Glenn Frey died a couple weeks ago. He being one of the founding members of The Eagles. I remembered hearing a local sportscaster talking on air about attempting to get The Eagles to play a private function at the high school he had attended many years before and now his son was attending. The name of the school was C,B.C. High School located in the St. Louis area. The date they wanted was to be this year in the spring, but in talking with the manager of the Eagles he was told that the band would not be available at that time because they would be on break from doing an extended tour. The manager offered them the date at after the final tour date which was July 31st 2015. They agreed on that date and this was a private affair and they would be playing for less than 500 people. Everything of course was kept secret of course to prevent any gate crashers. The manger said that this was to be their last job before their break. Glenn Frey was already sick and only got worse until he died. I looked up the band's show schedule and it showed all the cities and big stages they were playing on in front of thousands every night the schedule showed dates starting back in April of 2015 and sure enough the last date shown was July 31st 2015 at CBC High School. Very hard to believe that a band as famous as the Eagles last performance would be at a high school in front of less then 500 people.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;22 Sep 2015, 13:57</p><p>I've been enjoying watching Gareth Malone on TV, conducting a cappella singing groups he has trained. He's a neat-looking guy of almost 40 with 'dirty fair' hair and a pleasant smile, usually in classic NHS-style glasses with flesh-coloured frames and minus lenses - showing a bit of minification but no power rings or cut-in. He's worth seeing - and hearing!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2015, 14:53</p><p>I have not opened the picture of her wearing glasses but just by how hard she was straining and squinting to try and see I think Val is probably much closer than Ari. Is she only needed -.75 correction I don't think whatever she was trying to see was that far away from her that would cause her so much trouble with that weak of prescription. But -1.50 or -2.00 she would have a very hard time seeing anything more than just a few feet away without her glasses. Remember the letters on a teleprompter or monitor aren't that small. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Val</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2015, 11:55</p><p>About Ariana Grande. I would say -1.5...maybe -2. </p><p>The lenses look like high index, but the minification is big enough. </p><p>But I'm not an expert... </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ari</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2015, 10:14</p><p>My guess would be -.75 with a slight astigmatism. Anything wrong with that guess? Experts?</p><p></p><hr>

After her struggling with trying to see the first song Jimmy must have saw that she couldn't see it and he read off the next songs to try and help her. She must be too vain to be seen wearing glasses on stage, but it looked far worse when she was straining and squinting so badly. If she is that vain and has such poor vision I wonder why she wasn't wearing contacts?

It's interesting here in my own country when I tell many of the younger generation the ones in yur age group and i am bragging about knowing the lead singer and keyboard player of The Doobie Brothers not only don't they know my friend from the band but they don't even know who the band is. But he actually has sold over 65 million records. His name is Michael McDonald. He was very recently in town for a fund raiser which was a complete sell out and I got a chance to visit with him on his tour bus.  </p><p>If you want to hear his music go to You Tube and look up "What a Fool Believes" or "Minute by Minute" or even Takin it to the Streets" all by the Doobie Brothers and written by Michael McDonald.</p><p></p><hr>

They are best known for their song "Cool Kids" which probably got loads of radio play in the States as it got loads over here.

Any idea if she is a full time glasses wearer? Judging by theses pictures all taken at different times she must wear glasses at least most to the time and she doesn't bother taking them off for the camera which is even more proof how much self confidence she must have in her good looks. Great find. Sadly I have never heard of her band or her. I assume she just hasn't made her way to this side of the pond. You know i will be watching for her now.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2015, 06:11</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Oh and I almost forgot good luck at the optometrists today. I assume by now since your some 6 hours ahead of me you have already had your eyes tested. My guess is that your going to come away with a prescription close to your cousin's old glasses and maybe a touch more. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;20 Jun 2015, 06:06</p><p>Carrie </p><p>I totally agree with you. It's a music video with the same old thing we have seen so many times before. A girl, or in this case a group of girls, start off as seemingly uninterested in their looks and how their dressed. So its simple hair, little or no makeup, jeans, loose tops and glasses of course. Then "hot" girls never wear glasses and are always dressed as if there on a date. Then like magic, in this case a magic book hits them and they are transformed into the hottest girls at school. A change of hair, some makeup, nice outfits and of course the glasses have to go because no "hottie" would be caught wearing glasses. I assume the reason the glasses always have to go is because glasses indicates poor or weak eyesight or better put an imperfection. So to be a "hottie" you can't be wearing glasses. At least that is the way it appears in movies and other shows.  </p><p>Wouldn't it be nice to see a movie where a "hottie" or at least a very attractive girl that is say the prom queen graduates and discovers that guys only like her for her looks. But as shes heading off to college she decides she wants to be more than just a pretty girl and she decides she wants to be a doctor. S Even though she is very attractive she also was in the upper half of her graduating class. The strain of so much studying late into the night with less than perfect lighting takes it's toll on her eyes and her once perfect eyesight is gone. She first considers getting contacts but she always thought that glasses looked really nice on most people so she got glasses. And from there you could take the story any way you wanted. By point is go the other way and have the hot girl start wearing glasses. I think that idea would be a big confidence builder for many young women getting their first glasses. Carrie you were the exception because you really wanted to wear glasses even before you ever got glasses, but look at how reluctant some of your friends are about wearing glasses. Your cousin tried her best to go without glasses until she finally gave in. Your college friend was reluctant when she got her first glasses. So I think they the writers just need to be more creative with how they handle the subject of glasses wearing.   </p><p></p><hr>

She is sometimes seen wearing them out and about. I would like to make it quite clear that I am not into their music! The only reason that I decided to look at the video was because I heard them being interviewed on the radio and it was mentioned that they were dressed as nerdy girls in the video, so I thought they would likely to be wearing glasses. Two of them are wearing glasses but the other member of the group is wearing fake glasses. Here's the link to the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZD55SwZVnI and here's a behind the scenes video where she wears her glasses before filming. </p><p>The "nerdy with glasses" thing is getting a bit tiresome now as I feel that most glasses wearers are not nerdy, especially those in their teens and 20s. It could put people off wearing their glasses and I wonder how Jade feels about the "nerdy" thing. Her glasses are not nerdy and she certainly isn't. </p><p>Off in to town very soon as my eye test is this afternoon.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eyestein</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2014, 02:45</p><p>Below is a crude and awkward translation of some information about Diana Cazan. Note that her gender becomes lost and her surname becomes "boiler". </p><p> </p><p>For procurer boiler is affected in a proportion of 90 %.   The world through glasses with dioptres of 19 to read and 14 for distance.  It has a life as soon as normal in his 25 years, with joys and troubles specific age.  And he found, as he likes to call it, a medicine for my soul - music, this is the hardest thing that holds it to the float line in the moments when you feel that everything is now falling apart.  One gram of bad luck was not enough for that Diana to be born with serious problems.  "I think it is something wrong during pregnancy.  Parents are normal people, without health problems.  I wore goggles when I know what I did, I'm lucky, though, I fail to see, I can tend to myself.  At present, it is very poisonous affected eye are very high voltage, already had may keep under control, even with treatment.  On February 18 are programd to a hospital in Iasi for surgical intervention.  There is a risk that I can lose my and the last ten percent in view", told me Diana.  </p><p>Even if only appeares, Diana felt the man, he felt his intentions of voice tone.  High school followed the art of Craiova, then emigrate music from the Faculty of Letters of the university Craiova, specialisation music interpretation.  In 2007, it is a contributor to Berlin Philharmonie Oltenia is part of institution's choir.  He played on the piano, started singing popular songs, and for more than three years interprets light music.  He has won numerous competitions light music organized by the National Association of blind in Romania.  It has a warm voice, which transmits emotion, kindred spirits perfectly into your songs interpreted by Celine Dion or Lara Fabian, and the Romanian interpreters admired Paula Pantelimon.  On Diana boiler you have had the chance to see her and to the "X factor", where it was purr "angel X factor" by Dan Bittman.  Experience and confidence which they have acquired as a result of the music competitions in which he participated have invented it and more and want to participate in other competitions and music. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Owlish</b>&nbsp;11 Oct 2014, 04:16</p><p>Eyestein I think it was +19 for reading.  Here is another video in which she is reading the lyrics while singing.  If I'm not mistaken she's wearing strong readers, sort of half lens style.  +19?  Unfortunately the camera is fixed throughout and doesn't zoom in at all.  8-( </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m1DjoNrdyk" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m1DjoNrdyk</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eyestein</b>&nbsp;10 Oct 2014, 21:24</p><p>Perhaps it makes sense if +19 is her contacts prescription. As it would be the opposite of the rule for minus lenses the number would be larger.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eyestein</b>&nbsp;10 Oct 2014, 20:48</p><p>Diana is awesome. Some time ago there appeared a Romanian article which seemed to say that Diana Cazan used two different prescriptions of +14 and +19. I can't read Romanian and so I wasn't sure what to make of it.</p><p></p><hr>

I will keep to myself what I'd like to do with her and her tongue but I am curious to see what she looks like wearing her own glasses with her current image. It is quite scary how many fans she has. I know she is trying to shake off the squeaky clean Hannah Montana image and showing she is a woman now but she is overdoing it. Britney Spears had a similar change from the innocent image to the adult woman image. Britney wears her glasses a lot in public and has done for a long time. Hopefully Miley will also start wearing her glasses in public.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2013, 00:57</p><p>Curt </p><p>About 20 years ago I saw Stevie Nicks in concert at an out muny teather and and as most people know she has a thing about changing outfits after nearly every song. Mostly just a different schol. Anyway when a song was done she was being lead back by an attendent. It seemed very strange but the next day a local TV station reported that the reason she was being lead was because she had lost or had a damaged contact lens and her vision was so bad that she really couldn't see well enough without help. I was very surprised that someone that needed correction so bad didn't have a spare pair of contacts with her. Of course when she was younger she was very pretty.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;08 Sep 2013, 18:25</p><p>Soundmanpt - I'm not really in to rap either but she won the Mercury Music Prize in the UK a few years ago. She stood out for me because she was a British female rapper and there's not many of them. I don't know if that style of frames would suit me. They suit Speech. </p><p>I really need to decide on some frames soon as it is, as you say, getting close to when I was going to get my eyes tested. </p><p>My cousin still only wears her glasses when she feels she needs them (which is more than she used to). She hasn't gone full time yet although I think she tends to wear her glasses all day at college but I think she often did that last term.</p><p></p><hr>

The glasses she is wearing even though they are very simple would look much more real than your big frame plastic glasses.  </p><p>Have you found a style that suits your fancy yet?

<p><b>Revolver</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2013, 13:33</p><p>Interesting discourse on Nana Mouskori.  While it is a fairly low minus, it appears to be in the -2.00 to -3.00 range, and it seems unlikely that if she wasn't nearsighted in 1966 it wouldn't have gotten that high quickly.  Next to the youtube clip posted by Astra are several other clips, clicked on one randomly, it was called Adeiu Angeline and while undated it appeared to be of the same vintage.  Black and white, similar hair, etc.  It's possible that in the 1966 clip (hosted by the late great Danny Kaye) that early in her career she'd go bareyed and using glasses as her signature didn't come until later.  As mentioned, an interesting discourse, there are a few options.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2013, 10:50</p><p>No she likely wasn't that short sighted yet. For someone whose glasses were always seen on her and so defining of her image, she's fairly low minus.

<p><b>Anon</b>&nbsp;07 Jul 2013, 17:41</p><p>She definitely wears contacts, she's tweeted about it many times. And will talk about that and her glasses in interviews from time to time. That's why I always wondered why I hadn't seen any pictures of her in them. Seems like if you talk about it that much, you'd wear them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2013, 14:30</p><p>unknown </p><p> </p><p>Just like Carrie says if you look and listen at 4 minutes in she says she wakes up and thinks that she doesn't need to wear her contacts for an awards show and then she gets there and can't read the prompter.  </p><p>Not sure what she is making up???</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2013, 12:03</p><p>Carrie </p><p> </p><p>Good find! I know once she commented something about going into an optical shop and she picked this, as she called it, "ugly pair of super big glasses that she knew no one was ever going to buy" I think they are the ones in one of her videos. She has commented also that when she isn't preforming she is always wearing her glasses.  </p><p>One thing a little surprising is that her prescription isn't stronger than -1.50 if she has been wearing glasses since she was really young. We all know that is usually when the eyes change the most is from youth and through your teens.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2013, 06:27</p><p>Taylor Swift has a prescription of -1.5 and usually wears contacts.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;24 Jun 2013, 18:56</p><p>Guido </p><p>My first thought was that they are probably props for the video without any prescription, but a close look it appears they are a weak plus prescription. Lasik does seem to bring on the need for reading glasses at a quicker rate, but not usually that fast. Really it would make more sense if the glasses were minus since she may have had the lasik done even if her eyes hadn't become stable yet. </p><p>There is no law that says you can't have lasik even if your eyes haven't reached the stable point. Thye of course want your eyes to be stable for 18 -24 months for the best and more lasting results, but I am sure as long as your18 years old or older and you sign a release saying that they are not responsible for any vision changes you may have after the surgery.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2013, 18:05</p><p>I don't normally watch The Voice but did flick through it on the BBC iPlayer later just to see who did win. I was pleased Andrea won as she has a beautiful voice. Her glasses looked great on her. It's great that her reduced vision isn't going to hold her back from doing what she wants to do. </p><p>I had seen Andrea on trailers for the final but couldn't face watching the whole show. I'm not keen on tv talent shows, so I avoid The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent. Simon Cowell is responsible for these 2 and has made a lot of money selling the format around the world. The Dutch guy who created The Voice also created Big Brother and Deal Or No Deal - he has also made a lot of money. Even if you don't like the shows (like me)you have to admit that they are clever - Fairly cheap to make and millions of people love to watch them so advertisers will gladly spend a lot to get their ad shown during these shows (except for the UK version of The Voice which is on the BBC, so no ads.)which in turn makes a lot of money for the tv producers. </p><p>The only way I'd watch a tv talent show or the other shows I mentioned would be if a drop dead sexy woman with great glasses was on it. Even then I'd probably watch it on demand later and fast forward through it. (By the way I thought Andrea was pretty, but not sexy. I'm not being cruel - I wasn't put off by her strong glasses prescription. She's just not my type.)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;23 Jun 2013, 08:49</p><p>Well the guy's nickname is nickweymouth so maybe he's from Weymouth which is in England. The girl in question is from Northern Ireland which is part of the UK. Nickweymouth also appears to be a native English speaker. If I was to have a wild stab in the dark, I'd guess that the version of The Voice being referred to is unlikely to be the Kazakhstan version and is probably the UK version. There, not exactly rocket science is it? </p><p>The girl who won is called Andrea Begley, she's 27 and apparently lost most of her vision through congenital glaucoma. She wears fairly strong plus lenses, probably in the +8 to +10 region which presumably give some improvement to what vision she has. She has to be helped on and off the stage and so is clearly severely vision impaired.</p><p></p><hr>

They don't get it, that when they kill someone that person isn't ever going to come back, there gone for good. Real life isn't a video game.

<p><b>Juicebox </b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2013, 19:49</p><p>chrisb, </p><p>Couldn't agree more, they're producing some great stuff. Brittany has definitely given me more confidence to wear my glasses out in public more. Hopes she doesn't give in and switch to contacts, though she seems very self-confidant so I doubt she will. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Juicebox</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2013, 19:46</p><p>Carrie, </p><p>I know what you mean. Not many indie bands are fronted by women, let alone those who wear glasses! She has quite a few pairs I think. As I said I've been a fan for a while and she changes them up which is pretty rad. Not many frontmen wear glasses either though. I dont know what I'd do if I ever saw Julian Casablancas in a pair of hipster specs...probably faint as his sunglasses are pretty much glued to his head. But that's where Matthew Gray Gubler in series two of Criminal Minds comes in...haha. I listen to a *lot* of older music too and of course people like Buddy Holly and Morrissey wore them. It's funny cos those styles are what's popular now, it's kinda gone full circle! I'm in the Uk too :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2013, 16:57</p><p>Juicebox - you have the same sort of music taste as me! My brothers got me into it when I was quite young (I love the bands that were around when I was too little to appreciate them properly like Elastica and Garbage. I have copied their cds from my brothers!) I first saw Brittany in the NME a while ago (for non UK Eyescene readers NME is a well known rock/alternative music paper in the UK). Great voice. Good to see a "well covered" lady in a band in addition to wearing glasses. Both of these are unusual, even in the more alternative bands. Can't think of a female fronted band where that female regularly wears glasses in public.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>chrisb</b>&nbsp;20 Feb 2013, 14:02</p><p>Juicebox, </p><p>I'm really glad I found them on youtube and that they're known to the ES crowd. For me, as an aged white mal,e  its great to hear some new black R&amp;B; music (been into it since the 60s with Motown, stax, etc) Its odd you can almost hear Janis Joplin in her voice. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway to keep on topic, lets hope the band does really well and we get to see her Brittany in many different new frames over the coming months. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Juicebox</b>&nbsp;19 Feb 2013, 16:25</p><p>Brittany is such a great role model, I love her style. She's what I consider rock and roll because she doesn't care about anything but the music. She doesn't need a leather jacket and skinny jeans to back up a rock aesthetic because man - that voice is pretty unbelievable! So jealous! She can rock up in pretty casual clothes and glasses (love her frames) and still blow people away. Alabama Shakes have been up there in my favourite bands for a while, I'm not normally one to enjoy female singers (more of a Strokes, Arctic Monkeys, Libertines kinda gal myself) but she's got me sold with that voice. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2013, 09:23</p><p>Melyssa, thanks for the compliment to Marieke. I will share it with her. Mind you, she posed in the falling snow without any extra protective underwear, just the same underwear she used when we went to that gala party eight years ago. One photo of Marieke in the snow is now part of my portfolio on Mayhem Model and it will be fun, asking freelance models for future photo shoots if they have that kind of stamina :). About my collection of glasses: I was in an optician's shop just a few days after being on television (about my first exhibition with catwalk) and the staff said straightaway, "here's a man who has more glasses than we have in the shop". On the other hand, if I would tell my partner Nel about your glasses collection she would probably be jealous. She always had only one pair of glasses until we met. Now she has some more but nothing compared to your collection with up to date prescription!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2013, 06:48</p><p>You're welcome, Crystal Veil.  By the way, if I had in my possession as many pretty pairs of glasses as you have for your models, I would be changing frames every hour.  Also, I am jealous that Marieke could pose sleeveless in the snow.  I need an overcoat just to look at the photos.  :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2013, 18:06</p><p>Carrie </p><p> </p><p>Your choice is pretty much in line with what more than half said they planned on doing. Of course there were a few that planned on getting contacts just before the wedding and a few that said they could probably get by without the aid of glasses or contacts. Some said they would keep them on for the ceremony and just take them off for pictures. That one seemed a bit strange, but at least they will pictures both ways. but generally most said it like you did, that you wear glasses full time and everyone now knows you with glasses so that makes good sense to be as well. Also interesting that you said you would get new glasses for the big day. That was something that a good number also said they would do.  </p><p>Same sex marriage here in the states is still a hot topic as now they it is going state by state as to where it is legal now.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2013, 17:33</p><p>Great story, Melyssa, thanks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2013, 15:02</p><p>Carrie, </p><p> </p><p>It's more important to be able to see your surroundings on what could be the greatest day of your life.  And if you wear glasses full-time, that's what everyone else remembers you by. </p><p> </p><p>I had worn glasses for 37 years before my wedding nearly 12 years ago.  (It's been that long?  LOL)  That day I wore my white cat's-eyes while getting ready with my entourage.  Not wanting my eyewear to be the focus of the whole shebang, I switched to unisex clear frames for the photos, the ceremony, and the reception, and I wore red drop-temples for the honeymoon night -- the first glasses my husband ever saw me in a couple of years earlier on our first date.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2013, 14:48</p><p>Rihanna is incredibly hot. So jealous of her amazing body! Not really into her music, though. I like the fact she is wearing glasses but I'm not to keen on her choice of frames. </p><p>I probably would wear glasses for wedding photos. They are part of me now. People are more used to seeing me with them on than off. It's the same with Gemma. We have discussed marriage (well Civil Partenrship - Gay marriage is not legal in the UK yet) with each other as several people have suggested as we have been together for 2 years now. But we feel we are still a bit young as we both turn just 20 this year. We are very happy together as we are and we are really looking forward to moving in together later this year. If we ever did get married or the equivalent I would want to get new glasses for the ceremony and the reception just as I would want to get new clothes for the day. "Sensible" glasses to go with the "sensible" clothes for the ceremony and then some more casual or fun glasses to go with my party clothes at the reception.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2013, 09:43</p><p>I agree, she seems to be a bit of a 'rebel' in terms of how she has portrayed herself over the last couple of years - what with the various different haircuts, scantily clad/half naked instagram shots and as you quite rightly said, the acceptance of the scandalous behaviour of Chris Brown. I am almost embarassed to like her music! </p><p> </p><p>Having said that, she should be congratulated on forgiving him, not many people would've done so, and we don't the background behind this, but let's not digress too far off the original subject matter.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2013, 08:36</p><p>gwgs </p><p> </p><p>I would agree it does seem to show some distortion in her lenses which certainly could be due to a prescription.  </p><p>I have to admit that I am not much of a fan of hers anymore since she is back with Chris Brown. I lost a lot of respect for her when she went back with him. She would have been a great spokes person against abuse when he beat the heck out of her, but sadly like so many she doesn't get it that people that do that will do it again and again. There is no excuse for any man to ever beat a woman period.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2013, 05:38</p><p>Here's a link to a few photos of Rihanna wearing glasses which seem to have a hint of a prescription to them; </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2272690/Rihanna-shows-shape-figure-hugging-minidress-set-video-shoot.html#axzz2JvhPo9Qf" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2272690/Rihanna-shows-shape-figure-hugging-minidress-set-video-shoot.html#axzz2JvhPo9Qf</a> </p><p> </p><p>It's the first time I've seen her wearing glasses, but after searching "Rihanna glasses" on the above site, there are several other articles with her wearing bold black frames similar to this. </p><p> </p><p>I must say the partially shaved head look is a real turn off for me, but nice to see her in glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2013, 12:37</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Being 64 I well remember those glasses. Yes they were the in thing back then. </p><p>And as much as I hate to tell you but your probably right in 30 years or so you probably will be looking at pictures of yourself and asking "What was I thinking"? Nothing you can do about that though. I'm sure there are many that look back at old pictures and laugh at the glasses they were wearing. </p><p>There is much talk if you go to some of the web sites talking about whether they should wear their glasses or not on their wedding day. Some interesting comments both ways.  </p><p>So their is a good question, if you were to get married tomorrow would you or wouldn't you wear your glasses. I think for you since you could probably see well enough without but just if you prefer wearing glasses or not, but for Gemma she probably wouldn't have a choice anymore and would have to wear hers to see.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;03 Feb 2013, 06:32</p><p>The BBC have been showing 1970s editions of music chart show Top of the Pops. I find these really interesting as I'm really into music and a lot of acts in the 70s influenced modern musicians even if like me it was way before they were born. Thankfully most of the fashions stayed in the 70s. As an example I give you Althea &amp; Donna <a href="http://porchofthemystics.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/54bb4c8f-efb2-4ec5-ae24-332549187ce2.jpg" target="_blank">http://porchofthemystics.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/54bb4c8f-efb2-4ec5-ae24-332549187ce2.jpg</a> I like big glasses but those are not nice at all! Some of the male musicians I've seen on the show have been pretty awful too. Maybe in 30 of 40 years time I'll look back at photos of myself and think how awful my glasses were!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2012, 19:06</p><p>Crystal Veil </p><p> </p><p>That does surprise me because i would have thought my the great quality of your photos that your camera was most likely a much more expensive one than a simple digital one. Your right that does give me hope. As you say it can't hurt to try and see how I do. Like anything the more I try hopefully the better I may get at it. When i start I may well take you up in asking for your help or suggestions to make them better.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2012, 13:13</p><p>Soundmanpt (Oct 25th), </p><p> </p><p>you may be surprised to hear this but my camera is digital and it was ultra cheap ( 80). Your digital camera is probably better than mine.  </p><p>I knew little about photography when starting the "Ladies behind crystal veil" project and even at this stage my technical knowledge is very limited. It was - and still is - simply a process of "learning by doing". </p><p>Fortunately the technical aspects are just one of many factors involved in GWG photography. Being fascinated by the combination of ladies and prescription glasses is quite instrumental. It's also quite important to reassure the model at the very start of a photo shoot, then to monitor closely if she is feeling at ease or getting tired, and so on. Being clear about the effect you are seeking is another factor. This helps the model to play her role in an (inter)active way. A good photo shoot is the product of team work between equals. </p><p>Another factor is speed. There is nothing so boring for a model as a photographer fiddling endlessly with the umpteen options of his camera. If you work fast, the model will go with the flow.  </p><p>I would greatly welcome it if you give it a try. Aviator 0-0 puts a completely different "feel" in his portraits than I do. No doubt you will put yet another kind of "feel" into it when you start taking pictures of GWG's. That would enrichen this community. </p><p>If you have specific questions about photo shoots I am ready to share with you what I have found out so far. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark</b>&nbsp;31 Oct 2012, 03:55</p><p>Danny, yes you are correct, the lenses would be thicker. </p><p> </p><p>However when your vision gets past a certain point, using high index lenses gives you worse vision than with low index. </p><p> </p><p>The question becomes: </p><p> </p><p>Do you want to lose even more vision (strong plus glasses already restrict vision and cause distortions) than you've already lost just to have your glasses look a little thinner? </p><p> </p><p>The problem is the optical companies make more profit from high index lenses, so they're pushed on customers and abuse the vanity of most glasses wearers with "oh they'll look so thick and ugly" instead of "well if you go for those lenses yes they'll be thinner but your vision will be worse" </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eyestein</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2012, 08:14</p><p>Re: Diana  </p><p> </p><p>In the other thread there were two numbers mentioned in connection with her glasses - +14 and +19. I think she is wearing +19 where she performs with her sister. It looks like maybe she wears +14 at times to widen her field of vision when quality of close range focus is less important. Her field of vision must be extremely narrow with her full prescription. </p><p> </p><p>She seems like a very nice girl. Her sister looks nice too. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Owlish</b>&nbsp;26 Oct 2012, 06:56</p><p>The Romanian singer, Diana Cazan, has been discussed on the "Seen on the web" thread, and I'm still somewhat obsessed with her, so, here is a nice video of her and her sister doing a traditional Romanian song a couple of years ago: </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FceTjAIrI4s" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FceTjAIrI4s</a> </p><p> </p><p>+14?  Oh, yes. I believe it! </p><p> </p><p>In the following video, I think her real personality shows forth.  The video quality isn't great. She is singing in a Bucharest pub with a male vocalist who is blind. She joins him at about the 17:30 mark in the vid. </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOZm61Xv6nE" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOZm61Xv6nE</a></p><p></p><hr>

I didn't even know she needed glasses, just hoped she might. During my searching I read she normally wears contacts. I'm not really in to their music. It's not bad, just not my sort of thing. The current line up is completely different to the original one as each girl left she was replaced with another one just as if the record company had spare girls ready to join the group. Apparently the original members have now reformed using their first names as the group name! </p><p>Heidi is the most attractive of the current line up and always seems to be smiling which makes her more attractive.

We kissed and made up. If I had been caught with another woman (or even a man!) rather than just a video of one I think that would have probably been the end of our relationship. She said "When we are together and you feel horny and I am asleep, just wait until I wake up and we'll have sex! What we each do when we feel horny but can't be together is up to each other." We didn't go out but had a quiet night in and several glasses of wine later we fell asleep together on the sofa. We didn't hear my parents come in. They were probably surprised to find us in! One of them took a photo of me and my girlfriend asleep on the sofa and printed it out and put it on the coffee-table in front of us. Such a cute photo! They had then taken our glasses off and put them on the table and went to bed without waking us. It wasn't until I woke up at around 3:30 am needing a pee I realised what happened. I woke my girlfriend up as I moved and said we should go to bed. I showed her the photo and she loved it. I'll get my Dad to email it to her. We both fell asleep again when we went to bed but I woke up again because I was too warm and needed to pee again. As it's now nearly 6:00am I'm going back to bed before my girlfriend (currently sleeping deeper than a hibernating bear!) wakes up and catches me on Eyescene - now that would be awkward! </p><p>To the anonymous poster - My girlfriend would be even more annoyed if I was masturbating over a man's picture! I would still say I was bi but definitely more in to women than men now. Only Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt could tempt me back to being with a man! I don't ever look for photos or videos of men in glasses, only women in glasses. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2012, 22:00</p><p>Carrie </p><p>Maybe its just me, but its not like you were caught with another woman. God forbid what she would do if she were to catch you with someone else having sex. There would likely be bloodshed. You can't tell me that most men watching a Kate Uptown video wouldn't be doing just what you were doing. Really its only fantasy land anyway. My chances of ever being within 50 feet of Kate Uptown is about the same as being struck by lightning 50 times. And I am sure your odds on being with Carly is about the same odds. If anything I think she should have just got a laugh out of it. Whats the difference if as you say you go off to the bathroom or if your sitting in front of your computer monitor? I guess next time you will need to find a magazine with Carly's picture in it and take that to the bathroom with you. In short your girlfriend is making a big ol' mountain out of a very small mole hill.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>minus5wholuvsgwgs</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2012, 14:21</p><p>good luck Carrie I remember meeting a client who I rather fancied nothing happened but she was a nice fantasy when next I was intimate with my other half </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2012, 14:00</p><p>Good for you Carrie, I'm sure you're gorgeous anyway. </p><p> </p><p>She sounds really surprised but will probably get over it. It's natural to find others attractive, but still feels like shit when this happens to anybody. We're hard wired to be upset whenever happens though since "true love" makes other normally attractive people less attractive. IT's only something that becomes more bearable with age</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;28 Jul 2012, 11:40</p><p>I've just got myself into trouble with my girlfriend! </p><p>She was snoozing on my bed and I decided to watch the Youtube videos of Carly Rae Jepson I linked to last month. Now, as you probably remember, I quite fancy Miss Jepson and seeing her with the big glasses again got me turned on. Unfortunately for me my girlfriend woke and caught me watching the video (bad enough) but also touching myself in an "intimate area". She was seriously unimpressed (major understatement - she was livid!)! She asked me why I was masturbating with a video of another woman and why that woman was Carly Rae Jepson of all people! I mumbled a few excuses but they either weren't good enough or she just chose not to listen. She knows I fancy CRJ but maybe she didn't realise how much. I know I shouldn't have done it but I was feeling horny and needed to do something about it. I could have gone to the toilet to pleasure myself or waited until my girlfriend woke up but I didn't know how long she was going to sleep and she gets grumpy if I wake her (even for sex). Anyway she went off in a huff and locked herself in the bathroom. She can't go back to her house without coming back to my room as she left her bag and her glasses in here. She might be shortsighted but she could see well enough without her glasses on to see what I was doing to myself and then looked over my shoulder to see the computer screen. That must be just close enough for her to see the screen. </p><p>Surely most, if not all people masturbate occasionally even if they are in a relationship with a good sex life? I did when I was with my past boyfriends and my girlfriend does, she does know I know - her bedroom "toys" aren't always in the same place when I go over to hers. It was bad of me to do it without her. I'm not sure what she is more pissed off about - the fact I was masturbating whilst looking at another women or that it was CRJ or that I was pleasuring myself and she wasn't part of it. </p><p>Hopefully she will calm down soon. Every time I try to talk to her through the bathroom door she tells me to "F**k off!" I know she's seriously angry when she says that as she doesn't swear much. I don't think she'd break up with me because of this but you never know. I'm going to do some serious apologising and grovelling as soon as she comes out of the bathroom. I love her so much. I don't want anyone else, not even CRJ.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;03 Jul 2012, 20:14</p><p>Amanda Warner has fielded some questions about those specs: </p><p> </p><p>Women's Wear Daily (May 2011): </p><p> </p><p>&gt; Not surprisingly, after wearing the same custom Seventies white-framed prescription eyeglasses almost constantly for the past five years, she says she's really more about accessories. She counts Zana Bayne's leather harnesses and Shape Shiftr's tights and leggings among her current favorites for the stage. But it's her beloved glasses that complete her ensemble. </p><p> </p><p>&gt; "If you don't have any money or anything to wear, it's a really great thing to make a look," she says. "There are a lot of glasses in this shape, but there's something very special about these." </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.wwd.com/eye/people/warner-s-way-3613159" target="_blank">http://www.wwd.com/eye/people/warner-s-way-3613159</a> </p><p> </p><p>Esquire (August 2010): </p><p> </p><p>&gt; ESQ: How did you get started with the glasses? </p><p> </p><p>&gt; AW: I've had those for about four years. Honestly I just thought, "I'll wear really garishly loud jewelry and eyewear." I always have. I never learned how to put on makeup, and these seemed kind of like putting on makeup. I was playing minimal techno, and I thought, "Oh, that'd be cool, because people will recognize me." But they have my real prescription.  </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://www.esquire.com/the-side/qa/mndr-bio-081310" target="_blank">http://www.esquire.com/the-side/qa/mndr-bio-081310</a></p><p></p><hr>

At least I don't see any signs of lenses. In the past Katy has been photographed wearing several different styles of glasses and most are retro and they have had lenses in them, not sure if the lenses were prescription or not but at least they had lenses. I am not a fan of plano glasses but I really hate the idea of glasses without any lenses even worse. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2012, 15:05</p><p>Carrie </p><p> </p><p>Not long after I found that version there was a story on an entertainment show talking about that girl. Seems that Justin Bieber heard the song and liked it so much he signed her to a recording deal with his company. They interviewed her about being signed by him and she was thrilled and was really surprised when someone told her about that video you are referring to. She wasn't in that video but Justin and his friends made that just because they liked it.  </p><p> </p><p>Glad you got back in.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;27 Apr 2012, 14:42</p><p>I've seen the alternative video for Carly Rae Jepson's "Call Me Maybe" that Soundmanpt mentioned on 14th April. The girl wearing real glasses in the video isn't Carly but she is good looking (I don't know who she is). </p><p>I can't believe I'm saying this but I do actually like Call Me Maybe a little bit now. It is so bloody catchy! I have watched the official video several times too! In my mind, at the end of the video when the guy she has been trying to get the attention of walks away from her and gives his phone number to one of the male members of her band (mouthing "Call me maybe" to him)I would go over to Carly and give her my number and ask her to call me! </p><p>I am not telling my girlfriend or anyone else I know about how I would like the video to end or that I like the song a little bit, my rock-chick image would be ruined forever!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Apr 2012, 10:19</p><p>It would seem that Eddi Reader is wearing reading glasses. That would explain why she is looking over the top of them but keeps them on so she can read what is in from of her.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Apr 2012, 12:13</p><p>Carrie </p><p>The pictures there you can't tell anything from. But I went looking about and I found a version of that song you hate "Call Me Maybe" and it has quite a cast of performers on it. Several young guys that I heard of except Justin Bieber, but the young ladies in it I recognize all but Kim Crossman. The other girls are Selena Gomez, Ashley Tisdale, and of course Carly Rae Jepsen. In the video there is a girl that is wearing real glasses and I think it is either Kim Crossman or Carly Rae Jepsen. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;13 Apr 2012, 19:43</p><p>I found these pics of Carly Rae Jepsen with glasses on her head <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelhurcomb/4435731593/in/set-72157623627512568/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelhurcomb/4435731593/in/set-72157623627512568/</a> </p><p>I can't tell if they are real or not but I would like to see her wearing glasses properly. Her "Call Me Baby" song is annoyingly catchy and is getting played loads on the radio as it's number 1 in the singles chart over here. Not my sort of music, I'm more into guitar bands as I'm bit of a rock chick but she's not bad looking! Just to be clear I am interested in her physically and not musically!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;19 Dec 2011, 17:30</p><p>Thanks Chris for posting this. Being a musician of sorts myself, her fine looks in glasses soon kinda faded in the distance when I zoomed in on the song. If there are two musicians in the clip it escaped me. I was under the impression that she did a "Mike Oldfield", singing and playing all the instruments including the bass (Beatle Paul McCartney used to play one like this). The clip is attractive and the song is nice because the arrangements are simple, without overdoing anything. Sorry if this music talk is off topic - so yes, a nice GWG. Thank you!</p><p></p><hr>

I then went on YouTube and she wore her reading glasses on the Oprah show a few days back.  She seems to have several pairs and is defenitly dependent on them.  She has picked out some really good looking frames and they appear to be readers but on the Oprah show she wore them for a while after she quit reading.

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2010, 23:48</p><p>Jennifer </p><p>If your wanting your lenses to have a thick look they are great for that. I think that may be the one thing that may keep the bigger frames from becoming too popular with the young ladies. That style is fine for people with rather light rxs, but if your rx is very high and you don't want thick lenses it will force you to pay extra to get high index lenses. I've ordered the same style frame as Miss Duff is wearing for several young ladies, but they have all had very weak rxs. I doubt that they would be happy with that frame if their rxs were around -5.00. Don't get me wrong, at first I didn't like that look, but after these ladies got them I actually think they look very nice.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2010, 13:32</p><p>I think you're right, Val.  I've been noticing more and more teen girls wearing the Joe Jonas glasses.  Those frames are very bold.  I have yet to see a girl wearing those frames with a significant prescription.  So far, it's only been low minus. Who knows, I may go for those frames, too...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Val</b>&nbsp;25 Aug 2010, 13:24</p><p>FaNaTiKX, I like also very much the pictures with Demi Lovato. After Joe Jonas started to wear glasses almost everywhere he went, I think that Demi is another powerfull role model, that can persuade teenagers to wear glasses more instead of contacts, because it's "cool".  </p><p>Maybe this one has been posted before, it's about Hillary Duff: <a href="http://oceanup.com/2010/07/07/hilary-duff-rocks-joe-jonas-glasses" target="_blank">http://oceanup.com/2010/07/07/hilary-duff-rocks-joe-jonas-glasses</a> .

Those frames are hot, certainly more than Ma-donut's choice. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2010, 12:24</p><p>Madonna looks like she's wearing glasses normally worn by 80-year-old men (well, at least through 1980).  That's one frame I would never want.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Aug 2010, 12:13</p><p>Jennifer </p><p>Pretty sure her glasses have a prescription. If you notice she has sunglasses hanging from her top as well. I doubt she would bother with fake glasses and have shades as well.  </p><p>We must remember she is not all that young anymore, they could easily be bifocals, not saying they are. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2010, 21:36</p><p>Anya </p><p>Thanks! I kinda wondered if that might not be the case. I would have been surprised if Melyssa didn't know who Katy Perry was because they both tend to favor retro style glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Crystal Veil </p><p>Honestly I had never heard of the group before. It was more of a guess on my part that if one wore glasses the other two maybe did as well. I am not too young not to remember Sandie Shaw. I think I have a record of hers. For the youngsters thats a round thing bigger than a CD with a big hole in the middle.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2010, 13:46</p><p>@ Soundmanpt, Val, 4 iiii, </p><p> </p><p>Re your discussion about "Pussycat": as far as I remember, they were three sisters from Limburg, in the south of Holland, although a name ending with "stra" would indicate their family came from the north. And yes, their biggest hit was "Mississippi". I never met them in person, only saw them on TV. I am sure that none of the girls ever wore glasses on TV, not when performing, not during interviews. </p><p> </p><p>Some great female singers from the 1960's and 1970's did wear glasses off stage and I remember seeing pictures of Sandie Shaw in glasses (a rectangular black frame and a John Lennon frame). I estimate her Rx was around minus five</p><p></p><hr>

This shows up as vertical lines in the lens, to the right hand side for base out, and to the left side of the lens for base in, i.e. to correct inward or outward turning of the eyes. </p><p> </p><p>At an extreme angle prism correction can give the impression of power rings even in plus correction lenses. </p><p> </p><p>I would hazard a guess that Britney has a slight turn-in of her right eye needing about 3 degrees of base out prism.</p><p></p><hr>

And yes, despite the bare-eyed look in her recent photoshoot, she was wearing her great-looking black specs throughout. She's definitely a person who is better looking in person than in photos.

<p><b>Speximann</b>&nbsp;04 Jan 2010, 14:26</p><p>  The great thing about the renewed interest in the larger plastic frames is now GWGs have the option of either the smaller style frames or ?and the larger frames seen on the younger stars.

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2009, 08:03</p><p>Last night the biography channel did an hour special on Carrie Underwood.  There was about a 20 second clip on her giving a speech at what looks like her college graduation.  She was wearing some silver semi-rimless glasses that looked like they had a slight prescription in them.  I'm trying to find photos of this.  Could someone else help me look for them.</p><p></p><hr>

I just turn the sound down on the tv if she comes on but I keep watching! I read somewhere that she has astigmatism in one eye and the other eye she has pretty much perfect vision. I don't know if she wears contacts when she's not wearing glasses but I would guess she does if she wore glasses full time at school.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;04 May 2009, 09:50</p><p>Diva spotted the 'context'. Tim and his supporter did not.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;04 May 2009, 09:48</p><p>If 'your saying he is wearing full time now' is the subject (which grammatically it could be) that would express the idea that Marie was getting excited about the fact that Julian passed on this information, not the fact that Marie finds Justin Timberlake (whoever he is) exciting wearing glasses. If, as in the context of this forum one might reasonably expect, Marie is excited by the fact that the chap wears glasses, rather than being excited by the fact the Julian told her the chap wears glasses, then the grammar would definitely need to be 'you're'. Marie's initial 'apology' and Diva's post are correct.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;01 Apr 2009, 06:52</p><p>All4Eyes and Jen, </p><p> </p><p>There is another great concert video of Roy Orbison called "A Black and White Night".  It was obviously filmed in only those colors. </p><p> </p><p>If you get Sundance Channel, it often airs a couple of documentaries concerning the Traveling Wilburys.  There is some great stuff about Roy.  Unfortunately, he suffered his heart attack and passed away during that time. </p><p> </p><p>Also, Elvis Costello has a weekly show on Sundance that you might enjoy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2009, 16:02</p><p>Jen: I should add that I first fell in love with Roy watching that very video you mentioned. Up till then I'd heard "Pretty Woman" on the radio, of course, but I didn't really know who he was and I'd never seen him. I was really taken in by his hyper halos, they had this hypnotic effect on me I'd only felt from power rings before (but power rings and minus lenses are still my favorite overall). </p><p> </p><p>I ALWAYS make passes at guys who wear glasses (especially if they can sing!), Marie 8-)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;31 Mar 2009, 15:45</p><p>Jennifer: I LOVE Roy Orbison and have spent many an hour gazing upon his glasses. My best guess as to rx would have to be somewhere in the +8 area.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;22 Jul 2008, 07:56</p><p>VFL, </p><p> </p><p>I've always been able to spot hard lenses pretty easily.  Since soft lenses are larger, cover the entire iris, and seem to be self centering, they are much more difficult to notice.  I'm certain that vitually all professional photographers would ask to have contacts removed for a close up photo for magazines, books, CD covers and such.  They are way too concerned about "blemishes" and often "air brush" the photos for perfection.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;10 Dec 2007, 01:32</p><p>Did anyone else see Lesley Garrett on BBC1 yesterday at 10am? It was a pretty crappy programme but she looked fantastic. She wore some lovely dark frames for much, though not all, of the show. She really does look good in specs. Anyone hazard a guess at her rx? I thought she was presbyopic but she appeared to wear her glasses comfortably while interviewing guests at a distance. On the other hand she dispensed with them for part of the programme. I used to think she was arrogant but she came over as rather nice yesterday. And she is one incredible gwg!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2007, 17:11</p><p>I don't know how many of you are country music fans like me, but the other day I was listening to Kenny Chesney's Greatest Hits and when "She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy" came on, a light bulb appeared over my bespectacled head and I thought if I tinkered with the lyrics a bit I could turn it into a song about, well, something even sexier than a tractor. Then after I wrote it I realized this song is about me-I am SO that girl staring at the nearsighted guy in thick spex and drooling over every little detail of his visual experience! And so, without further ado, here is "She Thinks My Spex Are Sexy" (it's highly recommended that you listen to the original as you read this, next best thing to actually hearing someone sing my version (there wouldn't happen to be anyone here who'd like to try it and put it on the Net somewhere, would there?) ): </p><p> </p><p>Sliding down my nose in the hot summer sun </p><p>my thick, heavy spex, lordy here she comes </p><p>staring at my plastic frames and the lenses I need to see  </p><p>I tilt my head a bit and the white rings gleam </p><p>push 'em up my nose and the girl just beams </p><p>Just look at her face, she ain't a-foolin' me </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She thinks my spex are sexy </p><p>they really turn her on </p><p>She's always staring at me </p><p>while I've got glasses on </p><p>She likes the way they shine just like a coin fresh from the mint </p><p>she's even kinda crazy 'bout my bare-eyed squint </p><p>She's the only one who really understands what gets me </p><p>she thinks my spex are sexy </p><p> </p><p>She likes for me to tell her all about my sight </p><p>how I can't read the signs or see well at night </p><p>everything's a fog, I need a guide dog if my spex aren't on </p><p>She says she's got a dream and I ask what it is </p><p>She wants a little house full of myopic kids </p><p>and one more teeny-weeny squint before I take her home </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She thinks my spex are sexy </p><p>they really turn her on </p><p>She's always staring at me </p><p>while I've got glasses on </p><p>She likes the way they shine just like a coin fresh from the mint </p><p>she's even kinda crazy 'bout my bare-eyed squint </p><p>She's the only one who really understands what gets me </p><p>she thinks my spex are sexy </p><p> </p><p>Well, she ain't into legs or a cute, tight butt  </p><p>but if your eyes are bad, man her eyes light up </p><p>She thinks my spex are </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She thinks my spex are sexy </p><p>they really turn her on </p><p>She's always staring at me </p><p>while I've got glasses on </p><p>She likes the way they shine just like a coin fresh from the mint </p><p>she's even kinda crazy 'bout my bare-eyed squint </p><p>She's the only one who really understands what gets me </p><p>she thinks my spex are sexy </p><p>she thinks my spex are sexy </p><p>she thinks my spex are sexy </p><p> </p><p>Hmm, I wonder what Kenny'd think of that?

<p><b>Tod</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2007, 21:27</p><p>Kisal, glad you got to see the Pipettes in person and up close. BTW how strong would you guess Riot Becki's glasses are? I know she is nearsighted. I have heard she is now wearing plano glasses over contact lenses. Did her glasses have a Rx in them?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>kisal</b>&nbsp;04 Jun 2007, 08:05</p><p>I just had the wonderful opportunity to see The Pipettes in concert in Washington, DC.  It was sublime!  RiotBecki is so amazingly, absolutely, sexily gorgeous in her short shorts, tight polka-dot blouse and black-rimmed specs.  It was a small club so I was able to get really close.  The sound was great and the dancing was great and the best thing was that since she was on stage in front of us, I could stare and stare at her to my heart's content.  It's never possible to stare so long at a stranger or even someone you know without embarassment, and in a movie they keep cutting away from the GWG.  But in a concert I could keep my eyes glued to RiotBecki, who is just as beautiful in real life as in her pictures.  (And the other girls are great to look at too, although not in glasses.) </p><p> </p><p>If any of you live in England or California or Japan or Finland or any of the other places they will be touring this summer, you should certainly check them out:  <a href="http://thepipettes.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://thepipettes.co.uk/</a></p><p></p><hr>

Someone put her video on another EyeScene page and I know that I have fallen in love with her!  She was a runner-up on the Canadian Idol program a few years ago and has released two albums.  She is in specs in every picture and nearly every video.  I haven't found any good, large high resolution images yet but I'm sure they are out there.  I think she has a new official page:   </p><p><a href="http://www.theresasokyrka.com/" target="_blank">http://www.theresasokyrka.com/</a> </p><p>and they don't yet have the pictures up. </p><p>Her myspace page is great: </p><p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/theresasokyrka" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/theresasokyrka</a> </p><p>Her songs are very good (country-rock that is not really my style, but I'm willing to overlook that).  But definitely check out the video on that page.  She wears fantastic glasses in most of it.  Its kind of sad that in the fantasy section she doesn't wear glasses, but that's allright.   </p><p>There are also many videos on YouTube including her Idol performances: </p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Theresa+Sokyrka&amp;search=Search" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Theresa+Sokyrka&amp;search;=Search</a></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Katy</b>&nbsp;17 Jan 2007, 14:55</p><p>I just remembered an article about Robert Smith of the Cure that I read ages ago - found a copy of it: </p><p> </p><p>"Ross, when he first met me, was surprised at how unaware I am of the world around me. And on a very practical level, it's because I'm short-sighted. I don't wear glasses because I've found it's a very good defence mechanism. If I'm in public, I don't know if people are looking at me. But I can't actually see very well, I'm out of focus beyond my arm. And he thought I'd taken it too far, that I wasn't noticing the leaves on the trees. So I've started wearing glasses a lot more since I met him." There's a pause. He must think I look worried, because he adds hastily, "I always wore glasses to drive." It's a bit like Martin Amis, spending 25 years not smiling because he didn't want people to see his teeth; it sounds like a trivial, physical point, but you do wonder what it does to a person, to live the bulk of his adult life not seeing properly, just to evade the necessity of having to confront attention. It's another signal of his flexibility, as well, that he could adopt that modus operandi for so long, yet allow someone to call him on it, and then think, OK, maybe you're right, I'll change it.  </p><p> </p><p><a href="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1236945,00.html#article_continue" target="_blank">http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1236945,00.html#article_continue</a> </p><p> </p><p>Has anyone got any pics of him with glasses? :-)</p><p></p><hr>

You can also burn them to DVD after you save them.  </p><p> </p><p>First download and install RIVA FLV Encoder 2.0 at this link <a href="http://rivavx.de/index.php?downloads&amp;L=3" target="_blank">http://rivavx.de/index.php?downloads&amp;L;=3</a> </p><p> </p><p>When you find a video on youtube you want to save, copy the URL for the video to the right of the video on the web page. Open a browser and go to the following link </p><p><a href="http://keepvid.com/" target="_blank">http://keepvid.com/</a> . At the top of the page there is a place to paste the URL and you have to pick youtube as the site then start the download. The full instructions are on the web page. You have to save the with a FLV ext. </p><p> </p><p>Then you can play the file in the RIVA player or convert it to a mpg using the RIVA flv encoder".  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;30 Jun 2006, 12:14</p><p>Does anyone know if Canadian country singer Aaron Lines ever wears/needs glasses? Ive never seen him wearing any, but it seems to me in most of his pics (go to www.aaronlines.com to see) and TV appearances he has a serious power squint going. Hes absolutely gorgeous and Im madly in something with him (love seems a bit strong considering he doesnt even know me, but I think about him constantly and I feel all funny when I do-like I get butterflies in my stomach and then they decide to fly south!) anyway, but to see him in a nice pair of minus glasses (and preferably nothing else, but Im trying not to get overheated here!)-WOAH! The very idea gives me hot flashes! *Sigh* BTW, I wrote a poem about him, nothing to do with glasses, except of course I suspect he needs them, but I think its pretty good and hot anyway and Id love to share if yall care to see it (thought Id ask first, though, because I know sometimes off-topic posts are a nuisance, although I think some of our tangents are rather interesting, the people in this group are so wonderfully intelligent, witty and diverse in viewpoints). OK, now please excuse me while I go take a cold shower. ;)     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;08 May 2006, 02:41</p><p>Re Nicola from Girls Aloud, those photos were from the Paul O'Grady Show in UK. She walked on wearing them &amp; he complimented her, then when they had all sat down, he raised the subject again asking her about her glasses &amp; how it was nice that she wasnt wearing contacts like most other celeb singers. She replied that she had only just had then &amp; didnt want contacts in case she had to rely on them. I would say they are around +1.50 and she seems to wear them more now than not. </p><p>On a different sighting, check out one of the singers from all girl band The Pipettes. They are from Brighton (UK) and she is hot - never seen photo or video where she isnt wearing glasses - check out their video on their official website www.thepipettes.co.uk    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2006, 09:28</p><p>Lesley Garrett is indeed an insufferable woman. But I love those specs. And she is rather attractive if she keeps her mouth shut. I wonder why she's taken up as a gwg at 50. Maybe there was some latent hyperopia there which surfaced as she became presbyopic. Quite nice for the middle aged among us how our female contemporaries pile into specs in their 40s and 50. I was always a "minus" man myself! But I must confess that reading specs, and plus lenses generally, are growing on me with age!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Maverick</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2006, 05:04</p><p>Phil : Lesley Garrett appears to have gone full time.She wore them all the time on 'Countdown' the other week, where in the past she has only used them to read. </p><p> I just this minute flicked the TV over to 'Loose Women' (a prog I hasten to add I usually avoid like the plague!)where she is a regular and, yes, she was on and wearing her red framed glasses. </p><p>She is long sighted not myopic, by the way.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;30 Mar 2006, 00:02</p><p>Saw photo of Lesley Garrett in Hello wearing an outrageously lovely pair of red square-framed specs. I didn't know she was a gwg! She's same age as me so it could be presbyopia. But if she's fulltime it's more likely to be hyperopia or even previously uncorrected myopia? Anyone know? Whatever the lenses she looked yummy. Odd how so many people take up specs for myopia around age of presbyopia. Maybe they get sorted by optician for first time when problems become more complex than just a bit of blur in the distance.</p><p></p><hr>

The price has gone quite high on most of them, but each is accompanied by a hand written note from her about the frames, a note of her exact prescription and a picture of her wearing them.

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;09 May 2005, 02:28</p><p>Yes, I'd have thought John Lennon's Rx was a lot more than -2. In his introduction to 'John Lennon in his own write' Paul McCartney wrote about their early acquaintance and said something like: </p><p>Was he deep? He wore glasses so it was possible, and without them there was no holding him. "What bus?" he would say, to roars of delighted laughter.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>justme</b>&nbsp;08 May 2005, 23:40</p><p>Lennon described himself as 'blind' without his glasses- he wore them from quite a small child( he and his ex wife Cynthia had similarly poor eyesight- it's how they got together in college, everyone testing how far they could see.He also wore hard contacts for some time before 'outing' himself in public. Though I don't know I would say his prescription was considerably higher than -2, there are lots of pics out there through the years, both his sons are also shortsighted.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LG</b>&nbsp;08 May 2005, 18:04</p><p>Contacts in the 60's were known as "hard lenses" and were about $400 per pair. They were very uncomfortable. My sister, who is about -7, got them in 64. PITA !! As they did not flex, any tiny grain of anything resulted in a scratched cornea. Most people, like Lennon, would probably prefer to go bare eyed at -2. As his focus was his music, most of his activities would be occurring within 2 feet of his face. (Trust me, on stage, you don't see anything beyond the front of the stage anyway!) Another factor is the progressive nature of most myopia. It could very well be that he did not develop that Rx until he was in his 20's.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;08 May 2005, 16:08</p><p>Do any of you have any idea what John Lennon's prescription might have been? I'd guess -2 but I'm not sure if I can tell from his glasses. Old glasses tend to look thick even if they are not strong. But more interesting would be to know if he used contact lenses before going public with his glasses? I really have no idea how common contact lenses where back in the sixties. Maybe it was more normal to go around in a haze if you weren't very nearsighted (and Lennon probably wasn't). </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Terri</b>&nbsp;07 May 2005, 09:58</p><p>I'm sure someone has asked before (but my computer goes funny when I click on "View all posts") what do you estimate Kylie Minogues prescription to be? Also any links to good photos of her in glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SLB</b>&nbsp;22 Apr 2005, 14:42</p><p>Its the same effect with cameras - for a given focus the smaller the aperture the greater the depth of field about that focus point - squinting is effectivly just reducing the aperture.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daffy</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2005, 17:51</p><p>gwgs - i discovered that too. That's how pin-hole glasses work. I remember a little about the physics of why it works, but don't have time (if you're wondering).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>gwgs</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2005, 08:51</p><p>Guest - here's a quote i took off a Lisa Loeb site years ago, as you are aware, most spec wearers prescription increases over time so she is more than likely to be - as you say - nearer -6 or even higher now :) </p><p> </p><p>Q:  </p><p> </p><p>So, what's the prescription on those bad boys? Are we talking legally blind? Would you know a loved one past 5 feet?  </p><p>Does squinting really help myopics or is it just an endearing way to tell us sighted people you have no idea what we're  </p><p>showing you?  </p><p> </p><p>A:  </p><p> </p><p>Squinting does help to a certain extent. Also, making a tiny triangle- 1mm x 1mm with your fingers and looking  </p><p>through it also helps (seriously). My prescription is -4.75 +0.50 x 8 in my right eye, and -5.75 + 0.50 x 24 in my left..</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2005, 08:47</p><p>That same site also has pictures of Lisa Loeb.  Any guesses as to her Rx?  I think about -6.  I've heard that her hunky boyfriend Dweezil Zappa also wears glasses.  Has anyone ever seen him in glasses?  If so, what is his Rx?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chloe</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2005, 01:58</p><p>Their eyesight is bad, sure, but that would still leave them the choice between glasses and contacts. And I guess that in many areas of "showbiz" particularly women are still supposed not to wear glasses. So if they do, this could be interpreted as a sign (the unexpected/unusual creates meaning, semiotically speaking). I assume (or fear) that in many cases it is just a marketing strategy, marketing meaning, among other things, to create differences to comparable "products" (probably, this is true of people such as Anastacia, whose musical style IMHO is pretty mainstream and thus similar to many others, it might not be true of Eddi Reader or Catie Curtis). I do not really believe that Solo have not thought about this (there is at least this one photo of Susanne without glasses). Well, probably they have come to the conclusion that they want to present themselves "just the way they really are" (the quotation marks are supposed to indicate that I doubt the concept), because authenticity is a major theme in their self-presentation (their bios, their lyrics, their music).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2005, 17:47</p><p>I have to agree with Julian on this one.  A simple click to enlarge any picture and it's obvious that Erich has some plus power in his glasses and Susanne has some minus power in hers.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;11 Feb 2005, 17:11</p><p>You don't think it's just that they both need glasses?</p><p></p><hr>

You can see from the Posh Spice photo that she is short sighted and I know that Sporty (Mel C) &amp; Scary (Mel B) Spices are/were short sighted and I think Ginger(Geri) is also short sighted as I've seen her put glasses on to see something clearly in the distance.

<p><b>Karen X</b>&nbsp;01 Feb 2005, 14:08</p><p>I have seen an old photo of Kylie wearing glasses. The photo was taken around 1993/4 and she is wearing glasses that were quite fashionable at the time - largeish metal frames. They seem very big compared to her current frames - small delicate ovals in wire. </p><p> It's difficult to work out the strength of the lenses as she is facing the person who took the photo and you can't see the sides of her face through the lenses to work out the magnification. Her eyes do look big but this may be my imagination. They are probably weaker than her current glasses but strong enough for her to wear them (probably) instead of contacts. I didn't know she had been wearing glasses for so many years. </p><p>If you want to see the picture go to <a href="http://www.sayhey.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.sayhey.co.uk/</a> (you will have to register as it's a username + password site). When you have registered go to Kylie Picture Post and click on the topic subject "Glasses" (I actually started the thread to request photos of Kylie in her glasses). There are some nice pics of Kylie in her prescription glasses but also several of her in sunglasses. The old photo is near the bottom of page 2.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>eric</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2004, 06:41</p><p>I don't think Elton induced his myopia from nothing. In various places I've read that he needed glasses to see the blackboard, but wore them all the time because he wanted to look like Buddy Holly. His eyes did get worse - up to about -5, I'd guess - but there's no way of telling what degree of this was induced by over-wear. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;20 Dec 2004, 17:24</p><p>Interesting that someone would write about Elton John inducing myopia. I was examining his glasses when down at the Hard Rock (some grainy pics I took here- <a href="http://www.geocities.com/likeglass55/ej.html" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/likeglass55/ej.html</a> ), and they appeared to be more prism, low index, and thick lens stock, then actually minus in the Rx. There is no doubt that there is correction but it looked like a refract in the -4 or -5 range.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>leelee</b>&nbsp;27 Aug 2004, 21:17</p><p>Cazals - Aren't those the kind of glasses Spike Lee wore in his first movie: "She's Gotta Have It" I read the autobiography he wrote about making it, and there was this whole thing about how he had to get those glasses. It seemed like it was the biggest thing (or maybe just to me)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;27 Aug 2004, 19:50</p><p>Well, yeah, I'll probably get around to deleting this. Plenty of rudeness on both sides. </p><p> </p><p>I did get a laugh out of the 'split you into the dork and the nerd' line. That's creative! </p><p> </p><p>However, without dorks and nerds we'd be scratching pictograms in the sand, at best. There certainly wouldn't be any internet to post on (or to search for porn). </p><p> </p><p>Finally, read up on Cazals. Hip-hop has been around awhile and glasses go with it just fine.</p><p></p><hr>
