<p><b>ric</b>&nbsp;17 Dec 2017, 04:50</p><p>I hate people try on my glasses, but when it happened, always comments "omh, you must be blind" or "how could you see with this..."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Weirdeyes</b>&nbsp;16 Dec 2017, 05:06</p><p>How do people generally react when they try on your glasses? Most people say they have an instant headache when try mine on.  They never call them strong or say I'm blind though. I assume it's the difference between my eyes that causes the headaches. Since most people are probably right eye dominant they probably mainly see through the mild right lens and don't consciously notice the stronger left lens. So they don't really register my glasses as "strong", but they still get a headache. My RX is currently R +0.75 -0.75 L +4.25 -1.50. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stan</b>&nbsp;31 Jul 2017, 23:54</p><p>Here's one that happened to me quite recently about a week ago. There's this new girl at work who's cute, a little younger than me, and wears glasses. We went out for coffee the other day, and as we were sitting down and talking I told her I liked her glasses. After telling me where she got them I asked her if I could see them. Thankfully she wasn't one of those people who get weird about that. She took them off and handed them to me, they were strong enough that I couldn't see any details on her face. I really wanted to wear them for more than a few seconds so I asked her if I could take them to the bathroom to look in the mirror. I walked across the blurry coffee shop to the bathroom. I observed myself in the mirror with them on, they were somewhat feminine but I liked the way they looked on me. I went back to where we were sitting and was pleased to see that she was on the phone because I knew she wouldn't ask for her glasses back. I sat down and played with my phone, still wearing the glasses. After a few minutes she hung up and apologized. She seemed upset, so I asked what it was about (and also to distract her from asking for her glasses back). She vented a bit about family drama, before laughing and realizing I was still wearing her glasses. I jokingly told her they were my glasses now and she responded by saying in a false sad voice "fine I guess I'll just be blind from now on". I then gave the glasses back to her. I had a bit of a headache afterwards, but hey, who on here hasn't experienced that.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;26 Jun 2017, 08:23</p><p>Years ago when I was around 19 or 20 my friends band was booked to play at the neighborhood movie theater between movies. Of course we had to come in and set up earlier in the day well before the first movie came on. After getting setup I went to use the bathroom and as i past by the front desk area I noticed happened to notice the "Lost and Found" box. It was just a small cardboard box with various items in it such as a single glove various pins sunglasses and a few pairs of glasses. One of the glasses was clearly from a teen girl based on the style at that time. They were in a pink glasses case that opened at the end. I couldn't help myself so i put them in my pocket and left with them. I couldn't wait to get home and really have a good look at them. Once at home I put them on. They weren't very strong I could even see okay wearing them. I always wondered what the girl looked like that the glasses belonged to. I did feel bad because I knew that this girl probably only put her glasses on to watch the movie and after the movie she must have taken them off and tried to put them maybe in her pocket and they fell out without her noticing. Now she can't see things as well because she doesn't have her glasses anymore. I always wondered if she ever came back to the theater looking for them? I kept those glasses for a really long time and I had to hide them because I was still living at home. I don't even know whatever happened to them. I think I hid them somewhere and accidently threw them out.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Ty</b>&nbsp;25 Jun 2017, 20:01</p><p>Growing up I was always attracted to my friend Tony's sister, Katie. She was about a year older than us and wore glasses. One time when I was about 18, their family were out of town for a week and they asked me to come over avery day to feed their cat and bring in their mail. The first day I did so I went into Katie's room and found an old pair of glasses in her desk drawer. I know it was wrong, but I couldn't resist. I put them on and they were pretty blurry. At first I put them away but I didn't want to stop wearing them so I wore them while I fed the cat and then put them back carefully. The next day I took them out of the drawer again, only this time I hung around the house for about an hour while I wore them. </p><p> </p><p>On the third day however after wearing them for awhile, instead of putting the glasses back I pocketed them. Once my parents went to sleep I put Katie's glasses back on and wore them for the rest of the night. I even took them off and set them on the bedside table as if they were my glasses. </p><p> </p><p>The next day I went across town to where I knew that nobody I knew would run into me. Once I got there I started wearing Katie's glasses. It wasn't until I wore them outside in broad daylight that I realized how bad her vision really was, everything was really blurry which was even better. I probably walked around for about four hours wearing them. By the time I got back, my eyes had gotten so used to the glasses that everything was blurry after I took them off. </p><p> </p><p>I wore them a few more times that week until they got home. I've looked in the drawer since, but the glasses weren't there anymore. I sometimes wonder if I should've just held on to them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stan</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2017, 16:25</p><p>Here's another more recent one. About a year ago I went to a party with Kenny and his new girlfriend Amy who had glasses, but only really wore them while driving or for distance. Afterward we went back to my apartment and hung out, I ended up letting them spend the night because it was late and we had all been drinking. The next morning they had to leave early for work. Shortly after they left I noticed a glasses case next to my bed, I opened it and lo and behold Amy's glasses. I immediately put them on, they had almost no strength but enough to notice a difference. I got a text from Kenny an hour later asking if I had seen Amy's glasses. I lied and told him that I would be gone all day, but would check when I got home. I ended up wearing them pretty much all day, walking around the park near the river with them on. At first I was nervous that someone I knew would see me wearing them, but I quickly got over it and just enjoyed myself.  </p><p> </p><p>At the end of the day, I texted Kenny and told him I found the glasses. I was hoping he would wait to come and get them the next day, but they stopped by only a half hour later. </p><p> </p><p>Since I've known Kenny all my life, he knows about my glasses fetish. I've wondered if he ever suspected that I lied about not finding Amy's glasses until later, but he's never said anything about it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stan</b>&nbsp;11 Apr 2017, 00:22</p><p>I have a few more stories. One time when I was about 15 I spent the night at my friend Kenny's house. Kenny's mom was the young hot mom all of us had a huge crush on, she was only 18 when she had him I think. She wore a really sexy pair of glasses that I was really drawn to. Anyway,  I remember that night Kenny and I were playing video games. It was about 10 and she had already gone to sleep. I excused myself to the bathroom and to my immense pleasure, there were her glasses sitting on the shelf. I picked them up and tried them on, they were pretty blurry which made it even better. I probably spent about 20 minutes in the bathroom just wearing those glasses. After awhile I went back to Kenny's room feeling embarrassed at having been gone so long, but he didn't seem to notice (he gets like that when he's focused on his games). We played for another hour, the whole time I wanted nothing more than to wear the glasses more. Eventually he fell asleep while I continued to stay up. After making sure he was fully asleep I went back and wore the glasses some more. I even chanced bringing them into Kenny's room for awhile, wearing them as I played video games. I probably wore them for another two and a half hours before falling asleep. I had returned them to the shelf in the bathroom very reluctantly. </p><p> </p><p>I remember the next morning we were in the kitchen eating breakfast and was pleasantly surprised to see Kenny's mom walk in without her glasses. She was squinting pretty hard, something which turned me on, and asked Kenny if he'd seen her glasses. She eventually found them about ten minutes later when she went into the bathroom, but it was really enjoyable watching her go without glasses especially after knowing how bad her vision really was. </p><p> </p><p>I've spent the night at his house many other times, but that was the only time she left her glasses for me to play with.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Stan</b>&nbsp;03 Apr 2017, 01:15</p><p>I've definitely had my experiences with these. I've always had a weird obsession towards glasses that I couldn't explain. </p><p> </p><p>In high school there was this girl I had a crush on named Miranda who wore large hipster glasses. She also had a crush on me, but nothing really happened for some reason. Anyway, one time we were hanging out during study hall when I asked if I could try on her glasses. She took them off and handed them to me, they were reasonably strong, but not too bad. A few minutes later the bell rang and she asked for them back, but I told her they were mine now. I left still wearing her glasses. What surprised me is that she didn't really protest. For a good chunk of the day I wore Miranda's glasses. I enjoyed the slight blurriness they gave to everything, though since I sat in the back of my math class I had trouble reading the board. Strangely none of my teachers commented on the glasses. My fun came to an end three periods later when Miranda approached me at my locker (squinting) and asked for her glasses back, which I gave back to her. By that point my vision had gotten so used to the glasses that everything looked blurry for a few seconds after. </p><p> </p><p>This wasn't the last time Miranda let me wear her glasses, though she always made sure to get them back before leaving. I still find it strange that she was so willing to let me wear her glasses for half the day, but I was really pleased that she did.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2016, 09:22</p><p>I told a short story about Nicole and Jenny in July. </p><p>Yesterday I met Nicole (unfortunatly not with Jenny), but she told me that Jenny wear glasses more often. But not her old one`s. </p><p>She wanted to get a more stylish pair, so she asked family and friends for glasses she could try. So she got a pair from a cousin with some minus powers. The cousin she told, that she need them for school-theatre. </p><p>Now Jenny wear them sometimes after school or in the evening. </p><p>I hope I will meet her soon.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;13 Aug 2016, 08:37</p><p>When Anne opened her eyes she didn't want to think to what she was seeing. The strong blur all around meant both her contacts were fallen out when she was sneezing! Everyone around her was in the blur, the signs were disappeared from her sight, the people around her were only coloured spots moving here and there. She was really afraid, it never happened to her to be forced to manage without glasses since her vision had deteriorated so much. She tried to look for her contacts on the floor but neither the eyes, nor her hands helped hem finding them. With her glasses inside the registered luggage, there was no way for her than managing finding her connecting flight in the blur, walking through an unknown airport. She took all of her courage and went walking in the direction she was walking before when she was still reading the signs. Her eyes was good enough to avoid her walking into walls, for sure, but not to the point of allowing her to read signs in the distance. She was walking strongly squinting here and there from time to time to recognise a sign, a direction, something that could help her finding the gate she was heading to. A couple of times she walked close to advertisements on the walls thinking they were signs, while there were not. Finally she spotted a white panel that seemed promising. A dark spot in the middle of the sign seemed a text to be read, but no way of figuring out the letters from there. She walked closer and closer and the blur was gradually disappearing, but when she realised she was ridiculously close to the sign, with her head pointing up to the ceiling, she was still unable to read the sign. She had to squint as much as she could and concentrate for several seconds on the text before realising it was exactly what she wanted to see: a pointing arrow with the text "connecting flights". She felt a little bit relaxed and took that direction, trying to look around the people in the blur to hide her enormous troubles navigating like that in the airport. After all, she was managing in some way and was sure no one around her was realising she coukd not see a thing. After few other signs read more or less in the same way, she finally got to the right terminal. Now another challenge was waiting for her: finding out the number of the gate where her plane was expected to leave from. The screen was completely out of her range even squinting hard. She had a look around thinking of what could be the best thing to do, when her eyes noticed a figure quite close to her that seemed a guy looking at her. For a few seconds she wondered what she could do, then she decided she needed to understand more about the guy that apparently could not take his eyes off her. She squinted gradually to obtain some details on his face and finally she recognise a very nice boy, with brown hair and eyes, tall. He thought the see he was bespectacled, but didn't have time to elaborate all the information her nearsighted eyes were gradually providing when she heard him gently asking: " may I help you?" She was astonished an unknown boy could talk to her in that way, but she had no doubt he was talking to her. Did he notice she could not see a thing?! She was too much shy to admit and decided to pretend everything was fine so replied with a smile:"no, thanks, I'm OK". She was even more surprised when she heard him going ahead, ignoring her answer : "it seems you are nearsighted, aren't you?". There was no doubt she saw her squinting and realised she could not see properly. She was caught. No need for her to go ahead lying, he had perfectly understood the situation. After all, she needed some help, so she gave up and walking towards him to see his face better she admitted:" I'm nearsighted and lost my contacts, I don't see that much". He asked about her glasses, she explained they were in her suitcase and he asked what was her prescription. She was a little bit irritated by this personal question, she didn't want to reveal exactly how nearsighted she was to an unknown guy, but he insisted so at the end she told him she was -6. "Wow - replied the boy - that's a good defect! I understand you can have some troubles functioning without correction. Do you want to try these on?" and in the meantime he took his own glasses off and was handing them to her her. He seemed so resolute and she didn't have nothing to loose, at the end, so she accepted. She put them on and "Oh my God - she thought - this is the vision I need! Why on hell I can't see like this without correction?! My damned eyes are badly rotten and pretty unuseful without glasses or contacts. How I wish I had good or even much better eyesight..." but she didn't say to him but "I can see OK now, thanks. Just checking the screen than I'll give them back to you". He asked if she could read the screen (she replied yes, of course) and when she took out her boarding card from the purse to check the flight number he asked again if she could read properly with his glasses on and she replied they perfectly fit her eyesight since she was seeing really sharp with them. When she gave them back after checked the screen she thanked him so much and admitted she was really lucky to find another person with her same prescription to help her since she was quite helpless without correction. He answered she had been even more lucky than she thought since she also discovered she actually needed stronger glasses than she actually had. She didn't understood what does he meant until he revealed his glasses were -7. She was astonished since she never realized she could not see well with her present lenses. When she got home she went to her optician to get new contacts to replace the ones she lost that day in the airport and had confirmation that she had lost one diopter more since her last prescription. She never forgot the boy met at the airport and the unexpected way she got help when in the deep blur that day.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 09:20</p><p>Michael </p><p>What happened between Nicole and Jenny you might be surprised is not that unusual with teen girls. There are many reasons but one is that they are often experimenting with their looks wearing makeup and such. Glasses is no exception. If their best friend happens to wear glasses and she thinks her friend looks really cute wearing glasses you know she is going to want to try her friends glasses on to see if she looks cute wearing glasses too. Of course her friend will tell her how cute she looks wearing glasses and now that girl wants glasses herself even though she doesn't need them. The friend if she has been wearing glasses very long might tell her that she can have her previous glasses if she wants or that the glasses she's wearing when she gets new ones in a few months. Anyway it was a nice gesture fro Jenny to offer to wear glasses herself, even though she didn't need glasses, if Nicole would go with her to the party. But I have a feeling a part of her wanted to wear glasses anyway. At first the glasses would have felt rather strong to her but after a few minutes her eyes would focus with them and her eyesight in the distance would be razor sharp and crystal clear. But if she had tried to read from a book that would have proven nearly impossible if not impossible, but going to a party she wouldn't be doing any reading anyway. once at the party and getting some nice complements on how nice they both looked had to help her feel very confident about wearing glasses. While at the party and having a good time her eyes got very comfortable wearing glasses. If she has been wearing them more often now in public it seems Jenny enjoys wearing glasses now.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Michael</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2016, 07:59</p><p>A short story I heared from a friend (Nicole): </p><p>Nicole is shortsighted since she was ten y/o and her eyes get bad and bad since then. Now the prescription reached around -5 diopters. In public she don`t wear glasses, only contacts for a few years. </p><p>Two month ago, she was told by her doctor to gave her eyes a rest for contacts. In this time, she was invited to a party but she didn`t like to with her glasses on. Her friend Jenny was invited too. Jenny wanted that Nicole came with her and said to Nicole that she will wear glasses too, if she come with her.Jenny don`t wear glasses by herself but she wanted to borrow a sparepair from Nicole. </p><p>Nicole told her that her glasses are very strong for someone who don`t need any glasses, but gave Jenny the pair she got two years before. Jenny put them on and first her sight was only a lot of blurry. She said that was impossible to wear them at the party. </p><p>Nicole remember that she had an old pair in an old bag she never saw last five years. After searching a long time she found it, the glasses were a little bit out of fashion but the lenses had a weaker prescription, only round -2,5 diopters. </p><p>Jenny put them on and after a while she managed to see quite good. So she decided to wear them just for her friend to go with her to the party. Both girls got a lot of compliments for her look in glasses. And both girls decided to wear the glasses more often when going in public together. </p><p>I hope I will meet Jenny by myself to have a look how the borrewd glasses looks on her and how good she can see with them on.... </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;17 Jun 2016, 15:46</p><p>I did not ask to try them on, they are probably -.75 and I already know how that feels</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Apple77</b>&nbsp;16 Jun 2016, 20:19</p><p>MinusDude, </p><p> </p><p>Does he really need them much? Have you tried them?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;15 Jun 2016, 16:05</p><p>One of my coworkers recently got glasses for nearsightedness and in a short time decided to wear them full time. He mentioned that some of his friends who tried them on didn't think there was much to the prescription and wondered why he wore them mostly all the time. He explained he'd simply lost his patience in hunting them down from where he'd taken them off to where he needed them again. What a smart kid!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;10 Jun 2016, 09:56</p><p>no name </p><p>Sadly your probably right. Honestly English wasn't a very good subject for me. When someone is right there is no point to argue. </p><p></p><hr>

But I should probably go back to something like -2 as these would be a lot easier for beautiful girls to try on;-)  </p><p>I will try to keep you updated on her but I don't see her very often. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2016, 16:05</p><p>omg jesus christ.  have you ever heard of punctuation and paragraphs?!?!?!?!!!!  This looks like it was written by a 5th grader.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2016, 08:48</p><p>til </p><p>She obviously liked the looks of your Ray-Ban glasses and many Ray-Ban frames are unisex so she already probably knew your glasses would look good on her. So your suggesting she needed a handicap gave her the perfect excuse to ask for your glasses to wear meaning that by wearing your glasses her vision would be somewhat impaired making it more difficult for her to win if she wasn't able to see so well. Of course her wearing glasses wasn't going to stop her from winning even if she wasn't seeing perfect. Now if you had been throwing darts where she would need good eyesight in order to see the dart board wearing your glasses would have likely blurred her vision enough that she wouldn't be nearly as good at darts if her vision were off a bit. But for a dice game even if she couldn't make out what numbers she had when she threw the dice others were there to tell her and see her roll. But she clearly just wanted to wear your glasses. The fact that she continued to wear them even after the joke was over clearly meant that she had a desire to wear glasses. I'm sure you expected her to return them rather quickly after everyone had a laugh. But i'm sure you didn't mind at all letting her continue to wear them. I'm sure she enjoyed the complements on her looks wearing your glasses and almost every woman looks great wearing Ray-Ban for some reason. They tend to look great on every woman. When she was commenting on her vision with your glasses were you surprised that she was able to see pretty well with your glasses considering that your glasses are not what you would call weak and she apparently has perfect eyesight? But several things are important here. First of all having had a few drinks would surely relax her as well as her eyes. And even someone not drinking with good eyesight if they were to keep your glasses on for a short while would soon find their eyes slowly beginning to adjust to them. So at first i'm sure she found your glasses rather strong, but by the end of the evening she was seeing nearly perfect with your glasses. When she admitted to you that she would like to wear glasses that wasn't the beer talking but what she really wanted. She did say that your glasses were a little too strong for her eyes to always wear them. So when you told her that you had a another pair of Ray-Bans, which she clearly probably already liked the looks of Ray-Ban glasses, that were more narrow, your glasses were a bit too big for her face, with a weaker prescription she was more than ready to head to your house with you so she could try them. So if she was still wearing your glasses so you didn't have your glasses so who drove to your house or was it in walking distance? No surprise that if they were a better fit on her face and she loved how they looked on her that was the most important thing to her and the prescription didn't matter nearly as much. It would have been nice if you had gotten the lenses changed to a weaker minus but as long as the distance part is just a weak plus and if she in college she must be still young so her eyes should be able to adjust to them pretty well. Almost certainly whens she's spending long hours reading and studying she should find the add to be very relaxing to her eyes. So she wore them to her university this morning and has already texted you telling you she loves wearing her glasses, so she must not be having any problem with her eyes adjusting to them. I'm hoping you will be providing follow up on her wearing glasses and how she is doing wit her glasses. Giving her those progressives reminds me about something that happened about 30 years ago or more. Being a member of a non profit vision group part of what I did was make pickups at optical stores of donated glasses. One stop on my list was a Macy's Dept. store optical area. They had a very attractive young college girl working their in the evenings. I would be stopping their on my home from work. Anyway we became friends and with no doctor she wasn't busy so we would always talk for a good while until she closed her area. Anyway one evening when I stopped by she was busy trying on frames. She was glad I came by because she wanted my opinion on what glasses she should get. I was thrilled to her that she was getting glasses and would soon be wearing glasses when I came in. I asked her what her need for glasses was and she said that she had just gotten her eyes examined by their doctor earlier that day and her vision was perfect. But because she had been working their for a year she was entitled to a free pair of glasses. So she needed to pick out the frame she wanted to wear. After trying on about 20 frames that she had narrowed down to we both agreed on a very nice looking gold metal frame that went well with her dark her and dark eyes. I asked her how much she thought she would actually wear her glasses when she got them? She said that she would for sure wear them at work since they would help promote sales by her modeling glasses on her face. But she said that she really thought glasses look very cute and she would probably wear them when she went out as well. Anyway I stopped in the following week hoping to see her wearing her glasses but was disappointed when she wasn't. She told me that when she sent her order in for her glasses they rejected it because she didn't have a prescription lenses. It seems the company has a stupid rule that you only get free glasses as long as the glasses have prescription lenses. Even her manager didn't know about that rule and felt bad for her. They talked about what kind of prescription they could fit her with that wouldn't maybe cause her to need glasses. As it turns out this was about the same time as progressives were starting to be made. Her manager suggested that she should order her glasses with the new progressive lenses and jsut have the add segment way down in her lenses so she wouldn't hardly even notice it being there and the top part as plano (no prescription) So she sent her order in that way. But when her glasses came in as soon as she put them on she could tell the add segment was not down like she requested. On the paperwork that came back along with her glasses the lab had decided that the position of the add must have been a mistake so they corrected it. At first she was going to return them and try and have them do it as she had requested, but her manager convinced her that if she sent them back she might not even get them back at all. So the first time i saw her wearing her glasses she was wearing them down her nose a bit, not way down but they just looked like they had slid down slightly from where they really should sit on her nose. Anyway the next time I stopped by to see her I noticed that she had her glasses up in the correct position on her nose. I quickly pointed out that she was wearing her glasses like they were supposed to be worn. She said that was finding that replacing screws on glasses was easier to see if she used the add portion of her glasses. And she said that being slow she usually did a lot of her college reading while at work. Fun y thing for an optical store but the lighting really really wasn't very good. She started noticing that reading was also easier using her glasses, so she decided to wear them properly. Several years went by and I had a doctor's appointment at a medical center. as I was getting on an elevator i looked up and recognized this young lady that I hadn't seen for years. They had closed the optical center where she was working so I never saw her again back then. But here she was on the same elevator as me. She also recognized me and we both hugged each other. She was wearing glasses and still looked amazing. She asked if I was still doing the thing with the vision group which I told her I was and she said needs to send some of her old glasses. She took off her glasses and said how she really needs her glasses now. She said after the optical store closed she still wore her glasses nearly all the time because she really did like wearing glasses. She said after the optical store she worked at a retail store. While working there she started having trouble seeing things at a distance and she went and got her eyes examined and she needed -.75 SPH and her add had also increased a little as well. She said  her current glasses were -1.50 both eyes and +2.75 add. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>til</b>&nbsp;09 Jun 2016, 01:30</p><p>Last night I went to a bar with a friend for some beers. She's rather good looking and attracted other people's attention right away. At one point we were playing a dice game and she was just always winning so I jokingly said she might need a handicap. Let me wear your glasses then was her answer. I wore some black -3.5 ray bans last night. I don't need them and was fine without but she couldn't know that. Now -3.5 is pretty strong for someone who has never worn glasses but she seemed eager to give them a shot. The glasses were a bit too wide for her face but she nevertheless looked quite hot in them. I complimented her on her looks and she seemed pleased and admitted that she had already thought about wearing plans glasses for fashions sake. She commented that seeing things close up was not a problem at all and just the medium distances challenged her eyes. As they are moderate minus lenses I have no explanation for that. Anyway we continued the dice game with her taking down the scores while wearing my glasses. Other guests complimented her on the glasses as well what probably made her eager to keep them on. I was in heaven. After an hour or so the game was finished with her winning and I expected the glasses to come off straight away as it only had been a joke. No such thing happened, she just kept them on for the rest of the night. I was truly amazed,  -3.5 D too strong and wrong pd on top of that. She kept commenting on her vision and asking glasses related things what made it easy to keep making her compliments. At some point (and after quite a few beers) she stated that she would really like to wear glasses but these would be too strong for her to always wear them. I told her I had another pair of black ray bans, much more narrow frame and lighter prescription. They actually are very weak plus progressives I bought on ebay some time ago. Suddenly she wanted to go to try them on so I paid and we went to my house with her still wearing the glasses. I found them and told her they belonged to an ex ex girlfriend of mine and she may as well have them if she wanted to. She tried them on and looked marvellous in them, especially with slightly magnified eyes. I had once intended to have then reglazed with -2 lenses and now regretted to not have done it. But anyway she was fine with the prescription and even found it appealing that the lower part of the lenses made letters even bigger.  </p><p>End of the story is she went to university with the glasses on this morning and texted me thank you and she loves wearing them.  </p><p>I guess that only happens to me once in a lifetime.  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;09 Apr 2016, 08:50</p><p>He put minus or plus, not minus only. My sexuality makes no difference. Anyone would find it weird if someone only found them attractive because they had a strong prescription.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;09 Apr 2016, 08:43</p><p>Carrie, you are a lesbian with a plus prescription. He is referring to straight women with a minus prescription. You have no experience with that. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Carrie</b>&nbsp;09 Apr 2016, 08:16</p><p>Gerry - it's probably not very unusual as there seems to be several men who use Eyescene that have a preference for women with a strong prescription. I think most women with a strong prescription would find it weird if the only or main reason you found them attractive was their strong prescription. They would probably find it flattering if you found them attractive despite the prescription that they might be slightly embarrassed about. Anyone who felt less attractive because they wore glasses would feel much better about themselves if someone told them that the glasses didn't make them any less attractive. </p><p>When we were first dating my own girlfriend was worried I wouldn't find her attractive if she wore her glasses. Her prescription wasn't strong but even if it was I would still find her as incredibly attractive and sexy. She clearly doesn't think glasses on me are unattractive either. I would class her prescription as moderate and mine as borderline low-moderate.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>grimon</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2016, 16:31</p><p>When I was about 12 years old, i participated in a theaterproject. My part was to play a fuzzy professor. To give me the right looks our teacher suggested to get some glasses for me. I asked my aunt Priscilla, she was shortsighted, if she had some old glasses that she could borrow for this purpose. She gave me one of her too weak glasses, that she wouldnt need anymore. Wearing these glasses for the first time on a rehearsingdate was quite difficult, they were that strong, I could hardly see a thing. But everybody said, that this was perfect for my role and so I wore these glasses practically all the time I spent with the theaterproject. My eyes got used to the glasses the more I had to see the world through them. On our premier public date I put them on when arriving backstage and dressing as professor. Arriving on stage my eyes had adapted almost perfect to the strength of the glasses. For the first time I experienced to get sexual arroused by wearing the glasses.  </p><p>My aunt never asked me to give back the borrowed glasses and I kept on wearing them whenever my family and friends werent around.  </p><p>Through summer I was sent to a holidaycamp at the sea, where nobody knew me. for 3 weeks I had my aunts glasses on from morning to evening. Coming home I had to take them off and found out, that I was unable to see clear without the glasses. This was a shock. The blury seeing didn't go away and I had to tell my parents, that I needed to go to the ophtalmologist.The glasses I got prescribed were not as strong as auntis glasses, so I went with these on to an optometrist in a neighbourtown and asked to make new glasses with the same prescription which looked like my weaker glasses. Throgh this I found out, that auntis glasses were -4.75 left and -4.5 on the right lens, almost double to what I got prescribed.  </p><p>From then on I wore these glasses constantly.  </p><p>Visiting aunt Priscilla later that year, she wondered, why I got so shortsighted. In a four eye-talk she wanted to know, what I did with the glasses she borrowed to me. I am a bad lyer and she found out what happened and was very unhappy about this. I told her, that I am absolutely glad to have changed to be shortsighted and asked her if she had some stronger glasses for me. After longer discussion she gave in and gave a stronger(-5.5/-5.25) pair of glasses to me. Over the years I managed to become used to -9.5 glasses and I'm very happy to live as a shortsighted person</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;15 Feb 2016, 08:47</p><p>Likelenses </p><p>Who knows you could be right. I do every so often think about some of the people I have encountered through the years and wonder about them today. Like this young lady it was interesting because she didn't seem to have great desire to wear glasses and she never ever said anything about always wanting to wear glasses like others I have come across. Honestly when I first suggested that it might help her in getting hired if she were wearing glasses I think her main thought was in getting a better job that would better herself. I'm sure she realized that working in a medical profession was a big step up from working as a server at a bar &amp; grill and retail sales. Even when I went and brought in the sample glasses for her to try on she never did seem very excited about wearing glasses, but she did like any young lady would do took some time in picking out the ones that she thought looked the best on her. She told me about going to her mom's a few days after she had met me to do some laundry and her mom was shocked to see her wearing glasses. She told her mom all about me coming in at her work and informing her about the optical job and that her wearing glasses might be a big help in getting hired. Of course mom wanted to try them and noticed they had a prescription. Of course mom wanted to know if she could see okay with the glasses and she told her mom that she actually sees better with the glasses on. She told her  that she was wearing them because she had her final interview coming up with the regional manager and if she got hired she would be starting work within a few days and she would be wearing her glasses all day long so she needed to get used to having them on. She said her mom was very pleased to her that she might be getting a much better job and not working so many hours. She told her that  she really did look cute wearing glasses. I guess by now mom has gotten used to seeing her daughter wearing glasses. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Likelenses</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2016, 21:14</p><p>Soundmanpt </p><p> Perhaps she increased to -3.50,or more,married an optometrist,and lives happily ever after.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2016, 15:53</p><p>Anyway she was still happy about being able to pick out new glasses. I actually thought she looked really cute with the semi-rimless pair I gave her. But with women I think the idea of something new is the big thing and even better when it won't cost anything. No surprise that she decided on a really expensive pair of designer glasses with the best AR coating. The only thing that was driving her crazy was how long it took to get her glasses. Just like eye exam the glasses for employees get done last, customers first. So it was well over 10 days to get her glasses, but once she got them she loved them. She noticed the increase in her prescription but said it wasn't anything that would cause her any problem adjusting to. I must admit when i saw her wearing her new glasses they really did look nice on her and fit her face great as well. She made a very good choice. It turned out that she was one of the best employees they ever had. In fact the company was so happy with me for not only finding this jewel but the others before her also all worked out very well that I was invited to dinner as a thank you. Sadly this young lady was so good that she moved up the racks in the company and was soon an asst. manager at one of their larger stores and then she was hired away by another company out of town making much more money. But I have a feeling where ever she is she must be very happy that I helped her get into the optical business even if it meant that she has to wear glasses as a result which I don't think she even minds at all.  </p><p>And yes I do always wonder what happens from here on out with someone like her? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2016, 15:31</p><p>She said that a few days earlier she was filling the frame board with new frames that had just come in and she really liked some of them. So she took her glasses off and tried on several to see how they would look on her. Her manger saw her trying on the frames and told her that after about 90 days she would be able to get her eyes examined and a free pair of glasses. The manager asked her if she had any idea what her prescription is and she said no and that her glasses were her first glasses and she needs them for distance. With the manager had her come over with her glasses and she put the lenses in the lensometer which indicated what the prescription of each lens is. The manager wasn't too surprised that her glasses were really quite weak. She told her that her glasses are only -.50 and that she doesn't have any astigmatisms so they are really quite weak, but even being weak they still do make things nice and clear for her. She already knew that after she was there for a while she would be given an eye exam and glasses but she was sure by that time she would need at the very least the same prescription she was already wearing which was perfectly fine with her because she already loved her new job and the manager was very nice to her as well. Now she was worried if she were to get her eyes examined and be told that she doesn't need glasses at all. How would she explain that? I told her not to worry and that maybe when she had been there for 2 months she should test her eyes by seeing if they still go back to her normal vision if she leaves her glasses off for a while. I continued to see her every so often over the weekend at the bar &amp; grill and after she was trained and was working one day week alone when there was no doctor I visited her at the optical store. I had not paid much attention to the calendar but on one visit to her at the bar &amp; grill she told me that she had done as I suggested and on the day she worked alone she left her glasses off from the time she got to work until after lunch time and she tested her eyes on the eye chart in the contact room. She couldn't manage any better than the 20/50 line without her glasses and she missed several of the letters on that line as well. She put on her glasses and she could see everything perfect including a few letters on the 20/15 line. So she was actually happy with the results because she now feels confident that she won't do any better when she gets her real eye exam which was now only about a month away. It was funny because only a few months before she knew nothing about glasses and now she was actually happy that she is going to be told that she needs glasses and she is having fun trying to pick out her new glasses. That month seemed to come and go and she wasn't sure when exactly she would be called in to get her eyes examined because if your an employee they just work you during an open appointment time. When the doctor came an d got her she was a little bit nervous but at the same time excited as well. She was hoping that her own self test was at least close to being right. But she relaxed as soon as her glasses came off because she could tell things were blurry. At the end of the test the doctor told her that her eyes are nice and healthy and that there was only a little change in her prescription. He said her new prescription was -.75 in both eyes. She was a little bit surprised that she needed slightly stronger glasses when she was working hard just to get to where her eyes needed her -.50 glasses. I convinced her that the extra -.25 isn't a big deal and that she wouldn't hardly notice any difference in her glasses. I told her the doctor was probably just trying to help you thinking tat you have likley had the same -.50 glasses for about a year and the extra -.25 would just be a nice little bump to sharpen things up a bit for you. </p><p>continued    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2016, 14:33</p><p>She called me and she so excited. I asked her if she was going to continue working at the bar &amp;grill; and she said they were okay with giving her a Saturday night as long as she worked the Sunday day shift too. It was a couple of weeks before I had the chance to go to the bar &amp; grill to see her and I was interested in hearing all about the training she was getting at the optical store. It was great as soon as she saw me come in she came running over and I got a really big hug from her. It was so much different from the first time when I met her and she just looked like she was very down and very unhappy with life. Now she was bubbly and so full of life and she couldn't stop smiling. She had other customers to take care but said she would be back as quick as possible to tell me how everything has been going. I was pleased to see that she was wearing her glasses, the ones I had given her, and she really did look good wearing glasses. They really looked very natural on her. After a short while she came over and she began to tell me all about what she has been learning about vision and glasses. She was impressed with how much there is to know. I told her that she must be pretty used to wearing her glasses by now and she said she hardly notices them anymore and she said at first when she saw herself in the mirror wearing glasses it really seemed very strange, but now she really likes how she looks wearing glasses now. She said that vision must have changed some because the night before on her way home from working the Saturday night shift as she was driving home there was some smudges on her glasses so she just took them off rather than tio stop and clean them, but road signs were much more blurry without them and she jsut didn't feel safe driving without them so she pulled over and cleaned and put back on to finish her drive home. She said she knew at some point her glasses would start to have an effect on her eyes. I told her most likely if she had kept her glasses off her natural vision would have soon returned. I told her that she right that at some point your eyes may need that prescription but even with wearing your glasses as much as you are you still haven't had them long enough to have really changed your eyesight. I explained to he that her eyes have adjusted to her glasses but after she has them off a few minutes they go back to her normal vision. </p><p>continued</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2016, 13:54</p><p>For someone I had just met you have thought we were long time friends. When i went to leave she couldn't stop thanking be and I got a very nice bear hug as well. I had given her my number to let me know how everything went. I was very happy that only a few days had past when i got a call from her. She had met the manager and she said the manger seemed to like her and she was to meet with the regional manger the following week, but it looked as if she was going to get hired. She said she was sure that wearing glasses did in fact help because the manager even commented that it was nice that she wears glasses. Apparently the girl before must not have been a glasses wearer and didn't like being told to wear a pair with clear lenses. She wanted to know if she needed to return the glasses or if she could continue to borrow them? I told her she should keep them as a gift from me. She told me that she was wearing them quite a bit just so she could get used to having glasses on. I agreed with her and told her that if she gets the job that she will be wearing glasses everyday she works from open to close. She said that she was wearing them at both jobs and of course her co workers were very interested seeing her wearing glasses, but she just told them all that she just found out that she was a little bit nearsighted and that was why she got glasses. But everyone complemented her on her looks in glasses which she admitted she enjoyed hearing. Anyway her interview with the regional only lasted a few minutes and she was hired.  </p><p>continued </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2016, 13:31</p><p>She loved the fact that the hours were Monday - Friday 9 - 5 except on Tuesday and Thursday which was 9 - 7. Saturdays were 8 - noon and no Sundays. And i gave her and approx. of what the job pays which she loved even more. But she was still concerned and again was pointing out that she didn't have any type of experience for that type of job. She said again that she doesn't even wear glasses. With that I said that I might be able to help her with that. I went to my car and brought in several of my sample glasses that I use for the vision volunteer group I am with. Nearly all my samples have very weak prescriptions of -.50 or -.75 bit I do have a few with -1.00, -1.25 and -1.50. I only brought in the ones with -.50 lenses. To be honest I wasn't sure how she would react when she saw the glasses. She seemed to like the samples I brought in and I told her that it probably would be a help if she were wearing glasses when she was interviewed. I told her I was nearly positive that she went in and told the manager that I had sent her she would probably be interviewed at the same time. She tried on all the samples and the one we both seemed to agree that looked the best on her was a nice semi-rimless pair. She did notice that the glasses all had the same prescription but she said she could see just fine with them. I told her the best days to go was when they didn't have a doctor because she would be slow and more likely to give her an interview on the spot.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Soundmanpt</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2016, 13:12</p><p>Reading Cooper's story reminds me of a true story that happened about 4 or 5 year ago. I was at a local bar &amp; grill. As it were I was the only customer in there at the time. The young lady that was waiting on me seemed happy to have company and so she sat down and we talked about all sorts of things. She wasn't very happy and said that she was really tired because she was working 2 jobs at the time. On top of that she was a single mother so it was clear life wasn't all that good for this young lady. besides working at the bar &amp; grill she also worked at a retail store at the mall. That job only paid minimum wage and the bar &amp; grill she got less than $2.50 an hour and really depended on tips which weren't all that good either considering she didn't get the busier days to work. I had just been at one of the optical store locations where I picked up the donated glasses from and the manager and i were rather friendly. She asked me if I knew of anyone looking for a job? She was short a person that she needed to replace. I told her I would see what I could do. So when this young lady was clearly not happy with the long hours and poor pay I decided that this might be the perfect young lady for that job. The hours would be so much better and since they closed early on Saturday if she wanted she could even still keep her job at the bar &amp; grill. I had already found a several others that were hired from the same company but different locations so I knew about what the starting pay was and it was considerably more than she was making at either job put together. I told that I knew of an optical store that was looking for a person to train as an optician. Of course her first words were that she nothing about glasses and didn't even wear glasses herself.  </p><p>Contined </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2016, 12:26</p><p>Cooper </p><p>Great start! I will be looking forward to the next installment. I assume this is a fiction story and not someone in real life?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Cooper</b>&nbsp;14 Feb 2016, 09:42</p><p>Belinda was looking for a new job. She heared about that a big optician shop are looking for employees. </p><p>Her mother said that it could be better for her to wear glasses in the interview with the manager. She offered her a pair of her reading glasses, but Belinda had very bad eyesight with them on. So Belinda asked her friend Betty, who wear glasses since childhood for trying a pair of her glasses. Betty said that her glasses are quite strong, but she had three older pair with a little bit lower power for trying. </p><p>Belinda first tried the oldest one, Betty said there had 2,5 diopters. Betty could manage them quite good but she didn`t like the color. The next pair had 3,00 diopters and it was a rimless pair that Belinda liked very much. But the power was a little bit stronger. The third one are the nicest but with a power of 3,75 diopters too strong for her. </p><p>So Belinda asked Betty for borrowing the second pair and she did. Belinda now wears this pair every minute to train her eyes to see well in the interview. </p><p>Continued next days...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bensmith</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2015, 01:37</p><p>Heather's story, part 3/3 </p><p> </p><p>Jamie encouraged me to visit an optician. He told me I looked cute when peering at things but enough was enough, he didnt want her girlfriend suffer for such a ludicrous reason. It took me a few months to give in. During this time, I often secretly wore his glasses when I was alone, since he mostly had his contacts in. I enjoyed watching TV and being on the computer without squinting and craning my neck toward the screen. I'd examine the faces of people passing by the window in the street. It was amazing - I'd become used to only imagining what people farther away looked like. I'd examine myself naked in the mirror with Jamies glasses on, as I hadn't seen myself clearly in the mirror for about ten years. His glasses were such a guilty pleasure. </p><p> </p><p>Then I got glasses of my own. Black, square plastic frames. They didnt suit me especially well: I chose them hastily because I felt very uncomfortable leaning into the mirrors at the optician. After all, I had found myself in the situation I had avoided and dreaded for years. At the eye exam, I lied that I had lost my previous glasses, since I could not bring myself to confess that I had walked around half-blind since childhood. I had just turned 18 and my first prescription was -4.25 and -4.50. The thought of contacts made me ill at the time and I was very timid about wearing my glasses after such a long period of denial, so I only wore them when I absolutely had to. At first I even had to remove them when reading up close because the clarity made me dizzy. However, I immediately noticed that I was becoming dependent on the clear vision.  </p><p> </p><p>"Wow, finally!" Anna exclaimed when I hesitantly put my glasses on at school. I had to let her try them on, it was only fair after all. "Don't worry, Heather," she said, "the frame is awesome. They dont even look that strong. I think I might need new glasses myself." I know she tried to be encouraging, but I was depressed to hear that my glasses indeed looked strong. That was the worst part. I hated how they made my eyes dismally small. I even avoided looking in the mirror whenever I had them on. If anyone asked, I told that my prescription was "around minus three. </p><p> </p><p>Yet it was amazing to see everything so easily and in such detail, without the tiring struggle. During my relationship with Jamie, I often swapped glasses with him just for the fun of it. Sometimes I made him go without glasses or contacts to experience what I had gone through. He became so helpless then, completely reliant on me. We often made love with our glasses on. It was strangely unfitting, arousing in a strange way. I loved it that I now had two other people, Jamie and Anna, who I could confide in about things related to vision. Anna began wearing her glasses all the time after getting her second, slightly stronger pair. I maintained my ability to go bare-eyed for a long time. Later I found out that contacts didn't get along well with my eyes, and I hadnt even started saving for Lasik. However, I rarely went anywhere without the glasses in my purse anymore. I missed wearing them whenever I didnt have them on my face.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bensmith</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2015, 01:33</p><p>Heather's story, part 2/3 </p><p> </p><p>Once, when we were alone in her house joking around, she told me to try on her glasses. I would never have admitted it, but I had been waiting for the moment. I put them on, avoiding her gaze. The lenses took away some of the usual blur. Things in the distance were still fuzzy, which was disappointing, but I could see clearly almost two feet in front of my eyes. I enjoyed it more than I wanted to. Hesitantly, I told her that the glasses probably were probably a little weak for me. When looking in the mirror, I though the slightly round frame made me look nerdy and unsexy. They looked all right on Anna, but she wasnt very pretty anyway. Glasses, I thought, werent really an option for me. We spent the evening talking about getting contacts and Lasik in the future. It turned out that with Annas glasses on, I could see about as far as she could see without correction. My vision was that bad. </p><p> </p><p>I began wearing Anna's glasses now and then when we were alone - on the computer, shopping downtown, cooking, playing video games, whenever Anna didn't need them. With them on, I didn't have to lean in unbearably close to things, and it was a welcome break from my daily blurry world. When Anna handed her glasses to me, she often referred to me as "her blind little friend." Initially, I was embarrassed by this arrangement, but I could still publicly keep my "no glasses" image, and that was most important. The only restriction was that I couldn't wear her glasses when I had to read something actually far away, as they didn't help me that much. That was when Anna needed them herself, and I resorted to pulling my eyes or seeing fuzzy blobs. </p><p> </p><p>However, at some point my borrowing of Anna's glasses started getting on her nerves. She said she was getting dependent on them and wanted to wear them more. She didn't always give them to me anymore when I struggled to see and told me to get ones of my own. She could even get mean, discussing things in the distance which she knew were difficult for me to see while wearing her glasses. Once she got back at me by offering her glasses to me publicly in class, which she knew was awkward for me for two reasons: first of all, in public I pretended I didn't need any glasses, and secondly, her glasses were far too weak for me. </p><p> </p><p>By then my half-blind state was known to pretty much everyone, even if I preferred not to think about it. I hated to admit it but I had become dependent on Anna's glasses. I was jealous of her opportunity to simply put them on when she couldn't see something. Wearing them, she could make out everyone's face, which was something I sorely missed. I mostly talked to vague blobs, not seeing if people looked at me when they were more than six feet away from me. Unlike Anna, I also had to endure the constant fear of being found out and ending up in embarrassing situations. My only consolation was that at least I didnt wear glasses. I thought I looked much prettier without them - as ridiculous as it sounds now, especially with all the squinting I did. </p><p> </p><p>Things finally changed when I met my first proper boyfriend, Jamie. I couldn't hide my nearsightedness from him for long. He actually wore glasses, too, even though he mostly had contacts in. His prescription was -3.50 in both eyes with a little astigmatism, and he was appalled to find out I didn't wear any correction. I thought his prescription was awfully high and I was apprehensive about trying on his glasses - I knew even they would be too weak for me. We had compared our vision bare-eyed and he could read things a little farther away than I could. And true enough, I couldn't see perfectly with his glasses, but they were pretty close to what I needed. Jamies glasses didnt suit my face at all and made my eyes awfully small, but his frame was too large for me anyway. </p><p> </p><p>(to be continued)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>bensmith</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2015, 01:30</p><p>Heather's story, part 1/3 </p><p> </p><p>As a teenager, my vision was terrible but I absurdly resisted getting glasses for years and years. I didnt even tell anyone and just coped the best I could, pretending I didnt need glasses. I dont know why I was so much against them. I guess it was mostly embarrassment. And I managed rather well, although as I said, it was pretty bad. When looking at people on the other side of the room, I could only guess their identity based on their clothing and walking style. I had to bring things 10 inches from my face to see them clearly. Therefore, I spent my days looking at blurry people and objects, getting close to signs whenever possible. I could improve my eyesight momentarily by squinting, and when I had to see far away in detail, I could focus by painfully stretching back either of my eyelids. My plan was to avoid glasses until I was 20 and then get Lasik. </p><p> </p><p>When I was 15, I was thrilled to make friends with Anna, a new classmate of mine who turned out to be nearsighted like I was. She didn't have glasses yet but squeezed her eyelashes almost closed to see the whiteboard at school and often complained how she couldn't see. I thought she could actually see enviably well - she could sort of read the board from the front row or use the computer without leaning noticeably close to the screen, both of which had been impossible for me for years. When I sat in the front row, I had to pull my eyes into slits to see anything. Compared to me, she had the eyes of an eagle. </p><p> </p><p>We became best friends and she soon noticed my poor eyesight. I didn't admit it at first, but she could tell from the signs. After my vision problems had become totally obvious to her, I told her my vision was "sort of crappy far away." It felt so good to be finally able to share my embarrassing secret with someone who could relate to it. Anna seemed delighted, too. We used to compare how far we could see, bemoaning how people were supposed to see things in the distance and why our teachers bullied us with colored fonts. My vision was always way crappier than hers. </p><p> </p><p>The fact that we both needed glasses wasn't a secret for her, though. She often complained to others how we were "blind as bats." I was so embarrassed. I thought the whole point was not to tell anyone. "Boy, my vision is bad," she would tell our friends, "but not nearly as bad as Heather's." She used to tease me, probably thinking it was good-natured. "Look at that, Heather - oh, never mind, I forgot that you probably can't see it anyway." </p><p> </p><p>It was true that I often could not see what was going on. Anna's vision was so much better that I gradually learned to rely on her. She'd recognize people for me and guide me in unfamiliar surroundings. I, on the other hand, could read her the whiteboard at school and make out distant signs with my special squinting trick. It was sort of fun, helping each other out. </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, unlike me, Anna was desperate to get glasses since she couldn't really see the board at school. We were 16 when she eventually got them. I was devastated and thought it would be the end of our vision companionship. But she said she'd only wear them in class: she told me she only needed them for distance and didnt think they looked very good on her. I thought they looked like glasses - not flattering but not ugly either. And actually, from that on, things only got more interesting. She told me her prescription was -2. I was intrigued about this piece of information and at the same time embarrassed because I thought Id probably need stronger glasses. She often made fun of my leaning blindly into things, and she was astonished about my resistance to get glasses. She said I probably needed a hefty prescription, like minus five or something. I feared that indeed was the case. I didnt even want to imagine it. </p><p> </p><p>(to be continued)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom1</b>&nbsp;14 Nov 2015, 17:04</p><p>The blond girl girl needed to know if the boy she invited to the conference was in the room, too, between tens  of unknown people from the same college. She was so nervous in missing him, since she took opportunity to go to that conference mainly to see him again. However, she was aware that since her eyes have gone that bad, she would have never able to recognise his face. And this made her more nervous, since she had no intention to go to an eyedoctor and start wearing glasses. Since then she had been lying to herself for years pretending to see, but that afternoon she realized for the first time how bad her eyesight was, and simpler it would have been for her with a damned pair of glasses. </p><p>She noticed a girl sit close to her which was cleaning a pair of glasses, took her courage (after all she didn't know her) and said to her neighbour: "could you please borrow me your glasses? I forgot mine and need to look for a person around the room". The bespectacled girl replied "my dear, unfortunately my glasses are quite strong and I doubt you could see through them, for sure you are not as blind as I am". The poor girl was really helpless, so insisted to try and so she did. When she put the glasses on, she was really astonished since she could see just a little better, but most of the blur was still there! She tried squinting strong behind the lenses, but even doing so all the room and the people, but the closest ones, were still very blurred. The neighbour saw her struggling and told her:"as I told you they are strong, don't struggle so hard if you don't want to become as shortsighted as I am. You are lucky in doing without your glasses, I can't since years". </p><p>The poor girl was really astonished and felt so worried and  humiliated about her eyes. She didn't admit the glasses were far too thin for her, but decided to have her eyes tested soon. At the age of 19, after about 4 years since when she noticed she could not see the board as well as her mates did, she discovered her eyesight was as bad as -4.25!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;20 Oct 2014, 14:20</p><p>Laura was walking together with her best friend Maddalena, the only one person who knew she was very nearsighted. Often, Maddalena borrowed her -3 glasses to the poor shortsightded friend to allow her to read a sign recognise someone in distance or spot something in a shop window, but only when they were alone! No one must know how nearsighted Laura was...  </p><p>That time something happened: behind a shop window Laura noticed a couple of guys she knew approaching and suddenly removed the glasses. She had not time to handed over back to the friend so she put in her pocket and smiled at the guys. Both girls were now in the blur... the guys took the two girls to a fast food and queued in front of them. When was Laura's turn she just ordered the same thing the previous guy did, as she was used to do when she could not read the menu. Maddalena was in turn used to a clear vision behind the lenses and remained in front of the blurry menu, squinting and struggling to read, without success. One of the two guys asked her which was the problem and she admitted she could not see without her glasses. He helped her and once sit at a table he went on commenting: you are crazy going around bareeyed despite you need glasses. How can you survive without glasses?!?! My sister is doing the same and I always tell her she is stupid. You two are destroying your vision struggling like this, you should wear fulltime! As you can imagine Laura was astonished and very embarassed since she knew the only times when Maddalena took off her glasses was to borrowed her, so she was rsponsible for the very bad opinion of the boy. When they were gone, Maddalena wanted her glasses back and was really furious with her best friend. Useless to say that was the very last time she borrowed her glasses to her shortsighted friend.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>minusdude</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2014, 10:19</p><p>Thanks, Apple, the stories have been in shorter supply in recent years since the dominant gay club closed. Here's one from about a year ago - I decided to go as a hipster to a Halloween dance club party last year at a bar predominantly strait. I ordered a pair of hipster glasses from Zenni to do GOC - if they were too bad I could ditch them and still see. So I ordered -.75 each eye and wore a pair of contacts a little shy of my actual prescription. They were quite nice so I wore them all evening. One of my acquaintances from back in the day was there and I showed them to him. He tried them on and looked around and said "I can see better!" I wasn't surprised, he'd made a comment a few years ago that led me to believe he was a bit nearsighted, which I could share later. He looked good in them, despite the costume, and I asked him if I could take his picture if he'd take mine, too, but since the camera didn't have a flash neither turned out well.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2014, 19:08</p><p>I new I needed glasses when I was in high school, but was to shy and self conscious to tell my parents I needed them. </p><p> </p><p> After HS I went on to college and was having a lot of trouble seeing the board in the large lecture halls and I was usually sitting in one of the first couple rows. This guy who would become a good friend always sat near me new I was having trouble because I was constantly asking him what the professor was writing on the board, so one day he took off his glasses and said put these on and see if they help. They were a little too strong, but I could see the board better with them than without. After class he told me I needed to  get my eyes examined and I told him about the trouble I had telling my parents and he said he went thru the same thing and new what I was going through. </p><p> </p><p>The next day he gave me an old pair of his glasses  and told me to see if they helped, I put them on and could not believe how clear and sharp everything was and he said: "try wearing them and see what you've been missing and give them back when you get your own." Long story short I ended up wearing them for the rest of the semester and was finally able to tell my parents I needed glasses and get my own. If it hadn't been for Tim, I don't know how long I would of gone without getting glasses.    </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Peter</b>&nbsp;14 Jul 2010, 08:39</p><p>Here are a little story about borrowing glasses: </p><p>Years ago, I had a girlfriend, Lisa, who wear glasses. Her prescription were about -3 diopters. </p><p>Once a friend of her, Konny, were looking for a new job. She came to us in the afternoon before going to an interview with her new boss next day. The said that she heared from an other employee that he likes woman with glasses and Konny asked Lisa to borrowed an old pair of her. </p><p>Lisa said of course, but she didn`t collected her complete old ones and the only spare-pair have the same prescription as her actuelly glasses and they are quite strong for someone with perfect eyeseight. </p><p>But Konny wanted to try them. After putting them on she said that all things were very small and she had to concentrate to for reading in distance. But she liked the style of the black-rimmed glasses very much and Lisa and I found that the glasses suits her very much. </p><p>So she got the glasses with her. Next day she came to us very happily (and with the glasses on) because getting the job. She said that she walked arround the whole evening with them on for training. In the morning she wake up very early even for wearing the glasses as long as she could before having the interview. Her new boss didn`t realize that the glasses are not hers. And she asked about borrowing the glasses for next week. Lisa said that she could ruined her eyes by wearing full-time a cuple of days or weeks. Konny replied that the job was fantastic and it doesn`t matter if she depend of glasses like Lisa. She deceided to got her own glasses from an optician, but needed Lisa`s glasses for the lens-copy. </p><p>One week later she gave Lisa`s glasses back and showed us her own. They looked like Lisa`s but were more stylish and a little smaller. </p><p>I never saw Konny again. </p><p>Peter</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;13 Jul 2010, 08:17</p><p>Found this on a blog: </p><p> </p><p>The first job Michella tried for was simple... a telemarketer.  She simply made telephone calls and got hung up on quite a bit.  But the phone was right in front of her and the room was fairly small.  Michella had a great time working there, she made alot of friends, but suddenly there were some new procedures that everyone needed to follow.  A poster with the 50 most common reasons for hangups and how to salvage the call was hung for everyone to see...  Michella watched as they pasted the poster at the end of the room into a big blur.  The lecture continued that the poster was to stay on the wall because changes would be made to this poster only, no handouts.  Michella began to sweat visibly because she knew she could not see the chart and be on the phone.  If the caller hangs up, they told them to write down the code next to the last method used to keep them on the line.  She had been an excellent worker... until that day. </p><p> </p><p>The next day when the new procedures started, Michella tried to get close to the poster before her shift started and memorized as much as she could.  When she began taking calls, it began to fall apart.  Michella looked over at the blurry wall for help, but she just couldn't see it.  She would lose concentration on the call trying to see the poster, and eventually resorted to soft and then heavy squinting.  She knew people could see her but what else could she do.  During lunch that day, a coworker asked her where her glasses were.  Michella said she doesn't need glasses while rubbing her eyes.  Michella told me that the lady said she had an old pair of glasses at home that Michella could use.  But Michella said she was okay.  The lady said she would bring them in tomorrow anyway.   </p><p>Michella went home that night and told her husband that her day was rough on her eyes, and admitted for the first time that she really needed glasses badly.  He just laughed her off as a jokester and never took it seriously. </p><p> </p><p>When Michella came to work the next day, her boss was waiting for her.  He wanted to see her in the office because he said he had reports from other workers of squinting very hard yesterday and he asked why.  She said there was just something in her eyes.  So he took her outside into the call center and asked her to read any of the the lines on it in front of everyone.  Michella told him that she couldn't see it.  "Do you have glasses??"  Just as she was about to say no... her friend said "Honey you forgot your glasses over here."  They were the glasses she brought in for her.  She went over and took the glasses and walked back over to her boss.  Michella put the glasses on, and they were so strong and overpowering, she said she even saw double images.  He asked her now what she could read.  She strained her eyes so very hard, it should have been obvious that the glasses were not her own, but to her own surprise she managed to read a few lines.  The manager said he was no longer concerned, but wanted to make sure she was wearing her glasses whenever he saw her.  Michella walked back to her seat barely missing people and almost missing her chair when she sat down.  She told me she was so dizzy inside, but smiled back through the thick lenses and said everything was alright. </p><p> </p><p>But it wasn't.  Michella had to strain her eyes very very hard to see anything through the thick glasses.  She said they had a weird way of twisting everything and making things a mix of blur and sharpness.  The woman told her that she could wear the glasses until she gets her own pair.  Great for her.  The room was bending around the glasses and she felt like she was drunk.  When she made her way to the restroom later, she said she could see that when she got real close to the mirror her large myopic eyes looked red shimmering and consumed all around by the thick lenses.  </p><p>She said the next couple of days sitting for eight hours staring through the lenses gave her such headaches, she said she went through Tylenol like it was candy.  But she said each day seemed a little bit easier to wear than the previous one.  But the more her eyes began to adjust to the strength of the lenses, the harder it would be to leave the glasses off at the end of each day to go home.  </p><p> </p><p>After about a month, the strain of shifting between her own natural blur and the strong glasses, she decided to try wearing them full time.  That day she went home from work with the glasses on...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tim</b>&nbsp;24 Apr 2010, 21:48</p><p>Ah, I see, Dan. Fairly borderline. I would guess that your friend is about -1.5 but is less reliant on her correction because she doesn't have the astigmatism you have.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dan</b>&nbsp;19 Apr 2010, 12:43</p><p>Ended up staying at a friend's place on Saturday night and she had to go to work early Sunday morning.  She let me sleep and I ended up leaving a few hours after she had left for work.  Anyway, I knew she wore glasses part time and saw them next to her bed.  So before I left I decided to try them on.  Apparently we have almost the same prescription because I could see very well out of them.  Interestingly I wear full time and she refuses to wear them at all.  Shows you how everyone has a different blur tolerance.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SimonC</b>&nbsp;13 Apr 2010, 06:18</p><p>Not too interesting but hosted a BBQ on Saturday afternoon/evening.  </p><p> </p><p>A girl who I have seen in glasses came over with a friend but wasnt in glasses. After about an hour she took some glasses out of her handbag and put in my kitchen.  </p><p> </p><p>They were probably about -2 to -3. I looked at them a few times when passing by and as the day wore on I had to go try them so took them upstairs and gave them a good examination and some looks in the mirror etc.  </p><p> </p><p>When I came down I got a drink and then someone asked if I had seen the said girls glasses. I said no, where were they and as the kitchen was getting messier/cramped etc I had an easy excuse to say 'oh they probably got moved' and I quickly went back in (as I had put them where I found them), pretended to be look and bought them out.  </p><p> </p><p>By now we had been sat around the BBQ and Chiminea as it was evening time and bit smokey and another lady left and returned in glasses which were gain fairly weak but suited her very much.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SimonC</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2010, 05:21</p><p>As I have done the borrowing thing I said I am intrigued. This girl lived across the road from him so I knew of her but she went to a private school and boarded so wasnt really seen.  </p><p> </p><p>She had minus glasses and they were probably a good -4 or -5. His parents were good friends of hers and they had a lot get togethers etc and he said he found a couple of old pairs of glasses in her bedroom once and on more than a few occassions if he went over to her house with his parents he would sneak and take them as she was boarding and then take them back. Was interesting to hear this and I said did you enjoy wearing them then and he said not really because i couldnt see with them but they were interesting to look at.  </p><p> </p><p>Then a shocker came where he said when I eventually got glasses and he was one of the few I told as i was in contacts that in my early 20's he actually borrowed a pair of my glasses on a few occassions. He said he had finally confessed now (laughing) and he felt better and did I mind. I said nope, didnt bother me at all ( I have been doing the same after all). I asked again if he liked wearing mine and he said not particularly but at the time he was seeing a girl who didnt wear glasses and she would wear them for him.  </p><p> </p><p>I am wondering now what else he has done in the borrowing or other glasses related things but we had to cut off our conversation and apart from an email that he hasnt replied to I havnt heard from him since then.  </p><p> </p><p>Not so interesting as not my own experiences but involved in a small way....and got me wondering lots of things about him now. All good though.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SimonC</b>&nbsp;07 Apr 2010, 05:11</p><p>A bit of a shock, but a nice one.  </p><p> </p><p>In my Borrowing experiences listed down below there is one about a friend whose Mum wore low minus glasses (and I had a crush on). This friend moved to Australia about 6 years ago and apart from online messaging I have not 'seen' him since although I have plans to.  </p><p> </p><p>He sent some photos over about a year ago of a girl he has met and been going out with - all very nice and odd photos have come through. They have now moved in together and are planning on getting married and last week some photos arrived and she was in glasses - first time seen her in them. I commented about this and he said she's always worn glasses since she was little but has been in contacts for about 20 years. So I asked why the glasses now and he said 'Because I told her I have a real thing for girls with glasses and she started to wear them'.  </p><p> </p><p>I have known this friend for so long, and thought I knew everything about him and told him I didnt realise that and he started saying 'hell yeah, I think they are so sexy, and it makes them more beautiful etc etc'. I said I was shocked as I thought I knew him really well and he said 'well its a bit embarassing really and not something you really tell people'. So I said, without going into too many details of my feelings as I was interested in his, that there are loads of people who feel the same and I think it too. </p><p> </p><p>He went on how he liked certain people I knew, or were in films when we were younger etc so a few things started coming back to me that might have triggered things and then he asked if I remembered a girl called Jane who lived in the village who had glasses - I said yes and he said I borrowed her glasses on a few occassions......</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dan</b>&nbsp;19 Nov 2009, 14:54</p><p>No better place than the office to secretly try on ladies' glasses! I visited our Madrid office last week, and was delighted to see for the first time that one very attractive female secretary (in her late twenties) was a GWG. </p><p> </p><p>We always have a chat when I visit that office, which gave me plenty of time to admire her wireless frames with thin silver temples, and from the lenses cut-in and power rings I guessed she was about -5. When I passed her desk later that day I noticed she had removed her glasses, but must have switched to her contacts again as she seemed to have no trouble working, reading her computer screen,... </p><p> </p><p>At lunchtime everybody left for Spain's typical 2hr break, and I couldn't help noticing that her glasses lay unfolded and bottom-up on her desk. The office being a platform with all desks close to each other, I could easily pass by her desk and quickly take away her glasses! I then headed to the bathroom, locked the door, and enjoyed fondling and trying on her  specs, and spraying her immaculate lenses!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Marc</b>&nbsp;18 Nov 2009, 13:00</p><p>Great stories SimonC. </p><p> </p><p>I am especially turned on when my wife borrows other people's glasses. She has only started to wear glasses very recently, and is very interested to try on other people's specs since. </p><p> </p><p>Two of her best friends are full-time glasses wearers, and during a dinner two weeks ago the conversation turned to glasses. Her friends didn't know she alos had specs, so she proudly removed them from her purse and put them on. Her friends complimented her with her choice of frames, and asked to try them on. In no every lady's glasses were passed around, and my wife's were obviously the weakest prescription. I really liked how she looked in her friend's black framed plastic GUCCIs, that are oval shaped with thin temples. She even went to the entrance hall to look at herself in a mirror! The prescription was said to be about -6, so she didn't keep them on too long either as her friend couldn't see much with the help of my wife's glasses. </p><p> </p><p>When back home that evening I told her we should go shopping soon and buy her an extra pair!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SimonC</b>&nbsp;16 Nov 2009, 03:32</p><p>My last two experiences were not of great interest but having told of my others I thought I should finish off - I dont like leaving things unfinished.  </p><p> </p><p>My next was probably a couple of years after this on a trip to Scotland. I went with a girlfriend and best friend and he took a girl he had been seeing. We did some touring and camping and had a large tent. The first evening my friend girlfriend was sat around our fire, took her contacts out and revealed some lovely plus glasses. They magnified her eyes wonderfully. Nobody asked to try them or much was said but I took them the following afternoon when we were back at our campsite and wore them in the sites toilets for a few minutes. Not such an excitement wearing them but were nice to look at.  </p><p> </p><p>Final one was a lady who came to work with our company when I was around 24. She had some strong minus glasses and wore them all the time, never contacts - except for photos on staff parties and things. I longed to try them although never a chance. I think she may have had some other eye problems from snippets I heard but after about 3 years with us she had an operation on her right eye and returned to work for a few days with her glasses with one lens in. She had another operation the following week and she continued to work with us for a few more years before moving abroad.  </p><p> </p><p>One day I was looking for some staples or something and went in her drawer and the glasses were there - with one lens in. I took these home on some different occasions as even with the one lens they were great to wear.I always put them back and then one Christmas time I felt an urge to try them again and they were there but with both lenses in. Not sure why but they were. I took them home over the Christmas break and they got a lot of wear out of them. I think I took them twice more for evenings. The last time I went to get them they were gone from the drawer.  </p><p> </p><p>No idea why she put the other lens back in and wonder what happened to them. Would hope maybe her boyfriend or husband had asked her to wear them once more. </p><p> </p><p>Sometime after this a woman with approx -4 glasses worked with us and in a conversation said she was having laser surgery as her prescription was 'so strong'. A few people including myself talked about prescriptions briefly, tried on glasses and the woman whom I had borrowed the glasses from said 'ha, they are really weak compared to my old ones - I was -11'.  </p><p> </p><p>That was the last of the borrowed glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SimonC</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2009, 04:37</p><p>Almost my last borrowing was also my favourite. I started working n an office just as the junior dogsbody which I didnt mind at all. There were quite a few spectacle wearers which was nice.  </p><p> </p><p>The best person I found there was a Norwegian woman who had come to England when she was about 14. She was stunningly beautiful, had a fantastic sexy accent and was also extremely kind and nice. She was always cheerful and happy to help me. She wasnt one of the glasses wearing members of staff. She was in her early 30's at the time and engaged to be married. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, after a few months I was in the office she worked in and a glasses conversation was in progress and she said she was completely blind without her contacts. I remember vividly her telling her colleagues 'that pen (pointing to one on the desk)I wouldnt be able to see at all as its clear, maybe if the lid was in might make out theres something blue there'. One of the women said blimey and she went on to say 'I am minus 14'. Conversation continued and phones went and it stopped while people got on with work.  </p><p> </p><p>At this time I had contacts, glasses in secret but had no idea what -14 was or what my prescription was. Sounds completely stupid but I remember seeing some numbers on my contacts case and it rang a bell of being 14.9 or something and I thought maybe she was like me.  </p><p> </p><p>Have fantasised over this gorgeous woman to hear that she had glasses was just unbelieveable. I had to leave that office to get on with my jobs and I didnt hear any more that day or the next. </p><p> </p><p>The following week I was going into that office at the end of the day to do my final duties and she was the only one left in the office. She said to me 'Did I show you my glasses earlier' to which I probably sounded far too interested and eager but I rushed down to her desk saying 'no, why' and on her computer were these fantasticly thick glasses. They were a fairly large frame, plastic and clearish colour and she put them on her face. Huge amount of cut in and power rings of course and they were full thick lenses, not hi-index. She laughed and said 'ugly arent they'. To be honest they were not particularly flattering in terms of how they looked on her but she went on they were for a back up, the optician pestered her to get some and so she got the cheapest she could as she would never wear them. I remember her laughing saying 'well would you wear these in public?'. I didnt really say alot and when she took them off she was holding them up and saying look how small everything is and there quite heavy and then she folded them back up. There was a bit of laughing from her saying I always used to have to wear these thick glasses growing up and then she quickly changed to say was I leaving now cos she had to stay late and get stuff done and was going to shops to get something to munch on. I said I was going shortly and she said I'll see you tomorrow then. The glasses were back by her computer and then she got up and said bye and walked out the office. I went back into my office, thought about those glasses, was feeling so aroused and I went back to her office. Getting thereI thought shall I take them to try or not.....and to my surprise she came back in laughing saying it would help if she took some money with her. She got her money/purse and went back out.  </p><p> </p><p>I seized the chance and picked up those glasses and went to the mens washrooms. I couldnt look at myself in a mirror for fear of someone walking in but I took them into a cubicle and they got a good examination of them. The thought of her wearing them, how they felt, the weight of them on my nose and everthing combined made me masterbate. I was so excited but also so worried that she might come back, have got back and they wouldnt be there, how would I explain this! I was able to safely return them though before she returned. I actually saw her down the road as I walked to my bus and I probably had a wide smile on my face.  </p><p> </p><p>The following morning doing my post delivery around the office the glasses were still on her desk, in a different position to where I put them back but they were there. It was the last time I saw those beauties.  </p><p> </p><p>About a year later I played football with a guy who it turned out went to school with her and he said how she had these really thick glasses that made her eyes tiny but being from Norway and new and a lot of fun everybody thought she was great and all the guys fancied her. </p><p> </p><p>Following this experience I only had a couple of others which are not very interesting. Lots of trying peoples glasses when they were present but none of borrowing.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SimonC</b>&nbsp;13 Nov 2009, 03:58</p><p>Next chance for borrowing glasses came when revising for my A-Levels. There was a girl called Helen and she asked to help with Geography revision. I cycled over to her house which was about 10 miles away. Her older sister who had left school a couple of years ago had some nice minus glasses as did her mum I discovered, but sadly Helen didnt.  </p><p> </p><p>I always hoped she did and maybe had contacts and on the second visit to her house I thought my luck was in when I spotted a pair in her room. I didnt ask about them and sadly had no chance to look at them properly but I said I would go back over the following day. By this time I had contacts although only about 4 people knew this and I wouldnt be seen in glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>The following day I went over we did some revision and she went downstairs cos someone had come to see her. She was probably down for about 5 minutes and as soon as she left I went to the glasse, minus ones but not as strong as mine but still nice. I am guessing -2. They were of course tried on although worried she might return. I made sure they were back in their place. </p><p> </p><p>I had a real urge to ask her about her glasses but couldnt for some reason. I didnt fancy going for another 20 mile round trip the following day but did and it would also be the final chance to revise for this exam. When I got there the glasses were still in the same place and that morning I got up for a break from the revision and pretended to fiddle with some of her bits and pieces and then just came out and said nice glasses, are they yours? To my horror and disapointment she said no, there Dawns, she left them. Turned out Dawn was her cousin who had stayed over. I so wanted them to have been Helens. She did however get up and to my surprise put them on and said 'do they suit me?'. I said yes, she pulled them down her nose looking around and then back up and down and said something along the lines of they were really strong and then told me to try them. I did oblidge and said the same and I thought that would be it but she put them back on looking around and had a look in the mirror before folding them back up and putting them back. I cant recall the exact words but she said 'I'm glad I dont have glasses'. I remember saying something like your sister and mum do and her laughing saying she had her Dad's eyes.  </p><p> </p><p>I would like to think she tried those glasses while they were in her room and enjoyed doing so.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Apple77</b>&nbsp;12 Nov 2009, 12:12</p><p>Simon, </p><p> </p><p>That story is awesome - it sounds like he probably didn't suspect you, since he was confiding in you.  </p><p> </p><p>Thanks to everyone for sharing!  Let's keep it up, and I'll try to write more soon too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>NJ</b>&nbsp;12 Nov 2009, 10:53</p><p>The closest I have come to stealing glasses was in college, where I once went to the lost and found and told them that I had lost my glasses. They gave me a boxful of glasses, and I took a pair with a moderate minus script. </p><p> </p><p>Oh, and once I picked up a pair of strong bifocals that were lying near the pool and played with them for a few minutes while the cute young lady was swimming. But I put them back where I found them long before she got out of the water.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SimonC</b>&nbsp;12 Nov 2009, 08:22</p><p>I think Irv was also extremely mean. I do feel very guilty about my stealing of glasses too.  </p><p> </p><p>To continue my borrowed glasses stories as I dont have many left.  </p><p> </p><p>Around late 15 early 16 years of age a guy joined our school who had the strongest glasses I had personally seen. He was quiet and shy and I ended up sitting with him in French and we got along well. He had tortoiseshell plastic frames and these really chunky lenses. I am guessing they were in the -15 range from what I have seen and memory. </p><p> </p><p>My opportunity came when we were going to some convention and I stayed at his house. When asleep I took the glasses from his bedside unit and went to his bathroom. Although they were useless to see through the weight of them and knowing I had them and looking in the mirror over the top of them at how the cut in looked and the power rings just really aroused me something mad and I actually had to relieve myself in his bathroom. When I went back to the bedroom he was leaning out of his bed feeling around. I asked what was wrong and he said he had heard me and wanted ot make sure I was ok but his glasses werent on the unit where they always were. I quickly went over by the bed without turning the light on - there was just the light from the open door and I quickly pretending to look down by the bed and 'find' them. He said it was odd they had fallen off as he was carefull and although I had a chance to ask things about his sight then I just said maybe I knocked them off getting up.  </p><p> </p><p>About a year later a second chance to wear his glasses, same sort of frames but a different pair, came on a school trip to France. We were sharing a room with 4 of us and on the last day of the trip he got sick - blamed it on shellfish I think so he skipped the disco we had and went to bed early. I went to the room with him to keep him company and when he went to sleep I had a quick 5 minutes with them in the bathroom again.  </p><p> </p><p>It was the next morning when he asked if anyone had been playing with his glasses cos they were folded up and he always left them with the arms opened out. I played dumb and said not that I knew of and asked if people had played with them before and he said yes, some people had worn them and messed around in them and they got broke once.  </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if he ever suspected me? The only other time I have worn glasses that strong was when I was 19 but that is one of my last borrowed glasses experiences.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>minus 5 who luvs gwgs</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2009, 10:28</p><p>Irv is quite simply a thief yes take his glasses when drunk but any decent person would have returned them in the morning Irv you are lowlife</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SimonC</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2009, 08:55</p><p>Thank you. I am glad they are liked. I unfortunately do not have that many experiences of borrowed glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>Number 3 happened the following Springtime as I was 15 then but isnt so interesting. I went out with a girl called Katie for about 2 or 3 weeks. We later went out together again during the year and are still friends today - 20 years on.  </p><p> </p><p>I would not divulge my secret about glasses so she must have brought it up in conversation but I remember her saying 'I used to wear glasses'. I was obviously instantly attentive to this and asked used to, dont you anymore then and she kinda said yeah, I dont really need them. I did however ask where they were now and she said she didnt know but a few days later when messing around she found them in a drawer and said 'Oh theres my glasses'. She put them on - they were a grey mettalic frame and had very weak lenses which didnt bother me and she laughed saying did she look good and I said yes of course and then she threw them back in the drawer. I said let me try them which was the first time I had sounded interested in them and I tried them and had a look and they were only (knowing now) -0.50 or -0.75ish. I told her she looked good in them to try to intice her in some way to wearing them but she showed no interest.  </p><p> </p><p>Knowing where they were I borrowed those for a few days, put them back and took them for another few days and it wasnt noticed that they were gone. I liked wearing them but wish she had too.  </p><p> </p><p>When I got back with her later in the year I looked in that drawer but they were gone, in fact drawer had been tidied out.  </p><p> </p><p>Knowing her still today she sometimes is seen in glasses (wears contacts mainly) and her glasses are probably around -3 range. I imagine her saying she didnt need them anymore back then was her not wanting to wear them anymore.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopic Grant</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2009, 07:50</p><p>This weekend I went out to the clubs  wearing my newest pair of glasses; they're brown and in -7 to -8 range.  I really like them.  Anyway, there is this guy who is out every weekend or at least every weekend I go out.  I always thought he was cute, especailly when I've seem him in glasses, but my friend who knows him says he "gets around" a lot, and does drugs; totally a turn off for me.  Anyway, I've been introduced to him before, but I guess with my glasses on he didn't seem to remember me that well.  Anyway he flirted with me through out the night whenever he'd walk by me, and at one point I was sitting at a chair at the bar, and he came over and sat next to me.  He took off his glasses and started to wipe off the lenses, which totally turned me on, and got me excited down below.  I wanted to take advantage of the moment to have some sort of glasses conversation with him, and said "Yeah, that's the downfall of not wearing your contacts out to the bars."  Kind of dumb, but that's the best I could come up with that quick.  He then said, "Let me see yours" as he handed me his.  God, if he only knew!  As I slid them on my face I even got more excited.  I could see quite well, even though they were probably a dioper lower than mine.  He said, "Yeah, yours are stronger than mine."  He looked just as hot in my glasses as his own, and I wish I could have looked in the mirror to see what I looked like in his.  We both were wearing plastic rectanglar frames, but my arms were a little wider.  Well, I didn't want to take his off, and was still getting hard looking at him wearing mine, but we did finally exchange them back to one another.  I'm hoping he'll remember me now that we've had an intimate glasses moment, but time will tell, along with how drunk or drugged up he was...     </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SimonC</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2009, 07:09</p><p>My second borrowed glasses event occured not long after this, still in the holidays. Although I loved those red glasses and continued to I wanted a pair that I could use/see through.  </p><p> </p><p>My best friends mum wore glasses. They wouldnt have been much over -1 but she wore them continually - which was great. I think in all the times I have known her she took them off to go swimming and that was it. Anyway, she was really pretty and I quite fancied her in a way, a crush.  </p><p> </p><p>For two weeks his mum and dad both went away on a holiday and he stayed home with his older brother and sister. I went round and stayed a few nights at the beginning and he stayed at mine. One day at his he went in his parents room to look for something and I noticed a pair of glasses on his mums dressing table. I instantly wanted to try them on and later that day I had an opportunity to do so when I went to toilet. The wearing was fairly brief and I loved that I could see through these and actually clearer than without. I put them back but had such a desire to wear them some more I took a risk and got them later and took them home.  </p><p> </p><p>This was brilliant as I wore them all night on and off and stayed up late to watch Prisoner Cell Block H, no idea why I remember that bit. I did worry about what if one of them spotted they were missing, or were like me and liked to wear them.  </p><p>In the morning I had a shock. I woke up wearing them which was fine but there was a note by my bed from my Dad reminding me to get something from the shop. He must have seen me wearing them although nothing was said then or ever since. It did put me in a state for a while though. </p><p> </p><p>I did wear them around the house for the morning and early afternoon and it was great and was examining what I could see with them on that I couldnt and so forth. My friend came round later on and we decided to go back to his house to sleep over and I put them back.  </p><p> </p><p>I wonder if anyone did miss them or not. I wore them a couple more times during those 2 weeks but after that whilst my friend was still living at home I never found a spare pair at that house and his mum was never without them.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SimonC</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2009, 04:28</p><p>My first borrowing experience apart from occassionally trying peoples glasses on was when I was about 14. </p><p> </p><p>There was a girl I really fancied and she had strong glasses that at the time were probably about -8. </p><p> </p><p>I had a fetish for glasses by now and needed glasses although I never had them and didnt want people to know.  </p><p> </p><p>A group of us one summer holidays were bored as it was raining and the said girl (Samantha) invited us round to her house. She had recently got new glasses I remember and during doing whatever we did - I think listening to music and playing something like scrabble or monopoly someone asked to try her glasses on. I remember immediately feeling excited by this and she didnt mind at all us trying them on. One of the girls had some glasses for distance use, very low minus and my friend Jon had about -2ish.  </p><p> </p><p>We all tried them on and they were obviously too strong for any of us and I remember at my turn I had the briefest look through out of everyone - I think I was probably worried about seeming too excited or interested. </p><p>There were the usual comments about she must be blind and how strong they were etc and there were questions asked about what she could see and pointing to various things. I didnt ask anything as I was far too excited by all of this.  </p><p> </p><p>Then someone asked if she still had an old pair from when we started school (secondary) that were really big frames and there was some laughing and she said under the bed she had kept some old pairs. There were various plastic boxes underneath the bed that had keepsakes, old games/toys etc and in one there were 6 old pairs of glasses. The large ones were pulled out and tried briefly before her mother called up to us that there was some food on offer. Nobody else seemed too interested in the glasses and off we all went. After lunch we went back and watch some TV in her room and there was no mention about the glasses and we go on with things. When her mum went out somewhere and one of the friends had to go home we all went downstairs and I remember we watched a video. It wasnt intentional but I had left my coat upstairs and had some sweets in it and someone asked if I had them still so I went up to get it. When I got in the room something came over me and I just had this urge to take a pair of those glasses with all the intention of bringing back. I was quickly into the box, took a red pair, plastic and went back downstairs. I felt this huge rush of excitement and was there for about another hour but was so desperate to get home and try them.  </p><p> </p><p>I am sorry and still feel guilty but I kept these glasses for about 2 years and they eventually got broken when I was cleaning my room out. I would estimate they were about -5 looking back and strangely I never remember her ever wearing a red pair and I had known her since we were little. I used to wear them alone at home although couldnt see with them and sometimes I would just play with them, look at the lenses and power rings etc etc. I got plenty of pleasure wearing those red glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>She never queried them going missing, I returned to her house on many occassions but never went in that box again unfortunately. I do feel guilty now about 'stealing' though.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Irv</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2009, 22:32</p><p>Once at a party, my friends and i decided to have other friends over for a get together, it was during a heatwave in this area so it was hot. My roomate Jeremy who is about -9 in both eyes was compaining on how his sweat was making his glasses slide down his face, while we were dancing in the living room. In my mind i was thinking to myself, it would be hit if they slid down, and he couldnt find them. This got me excited. As the night continued he got really drunk. While Jeremy was outside smoking a cigerette, he began to throw up. So while he was next to me, i knocked his glasses off on purpuse. This giving me a huge boner. Jeremy thought i was helping him, and was too busy throwing up to worry about his glasses. As soon as he stopped than he noticed he couldnt see, i kicked them into the grass. since he is -9 in both eyes he had no clue where they were. Than he started to panic saying how blind he was, i told him to walk back to the house, which than he told me "irv i have no clue on how to get back". THis really turned me on. However a couple of guys from the party came out, too see if jeremy was ok. He was telling them how he lost his glasses and couldnt see. Than i began to panic, i didnt want the crew to find his glasses. i wanted Jeremy blind, because its something that turns me on, having him helpless. So since he had no clue where i knocked them off at, i told the guys that they were in an area away from where i kicked the glasses. Thats when i went and got the glasses, and put them in my pocket. Jeremy began saying how bad he needed them because the comming monday he had a review for his stats exam, although i felt sorry for him i didnt give him his glasses. All of a sudden Jeremy began throwing up more, thats when we gave up "looking" for the glasses. Jeremy began to cry, because he was blind and had no other way of seeing, so we laid him into bed. He immediately fell asleep beacsue of the alochol. While he was sleep the guys thought it would be a funny prank to strip him to his boxers. Jeremy was in a deep sleep, they took his shirt off, and took his flip flops and jeans on, to find out, jeremy had no boxers on. The guys thought it was funny, but it was something that was a turn on. After the prank, they put the covers over him and let him sleep. </p><p> </p><p>Since me and jeremy share rooms, the next morning i heard him wake up and fumbling. I didnt pay any mind because i was extremly tired. Than i figured it was jermy looking for his clothes. I kept quiet and was pretend i was sleep, than naked jeremy left going to the bathroom. He had no trouble knowing his way because im assuming hes use to it, during the late nights he usually goes without glasses. Jeremy than woke me up (NAKED) and asked me what happened the night before. Why was he naked, he told me he only rmemebered loosing his glases, and being put to bed. I than told him the guys stripped him down, and that they didnt know that he didnt have any boxers on, so thought it would be funnier to leave him like that. I had to get out of bed, to help him find clothes for him to wear. After he was telling me about he was really helpless without glasses. Me still having his glasses, i felt in control. I had to help him do a lot of things, and went for a walk and threw his glasses in a public trash can. Jeremy blames himself, for getting too wasted, but he will never know that it was actually me who knocked his glasses off.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Original Tony</b>&nbsp;15 Oct 2009, 04:06</p><p>On a train the other day a guy about tenty five ish was sitting next to me. He took off his strong glasses and put them in thier case. </p><p>I asked him to confirm directions on a map to me and he had to put his glasses back on see it. I commented on how nice and light the glasses were [rimless and hingeless] and asked to try them on.I did so and they appeared to be in the minus 5 region to me. </p><p> </p><p>He told me his job was a physical trainer. I wonder if he kept his glasses case with him to house the glasses when he did physical manouvres. I was suprised that he took his glasses off when travelling on the train as he could probably see Jack Shit without them. </p><p>I would imagine the guy hated wearing glasses as he had the most non noticable glasses you could get.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Original Tony</b>&nbsp;12 Oct 2009, 13:59</p><p>THE ADVENTURES OF CHAS - PART 2 </p><p> </p><p>After the Game Chas knew that he needed glasses big time. He went for an eye exam and the eye doctor was amazed to discover that Chas was -2.25 with quite a bit of astigmatism. The net effect was to bump up Chas's blur. Chas went to the local cafe with his glasses and used his glasses to play pool. After playing the game he lay them on the table. After about a week or so he became a full timer. </p><p> </p><p>Within a few weks it became time for Chas to leave for College. He packed up his things and drove to the campus. He moved into a room designed for two students. The college was undergouing a major revamp and some accomodation blocks has ben knocked down. Because of this the College Authorities allowed a third person to stay in the rooms for periods of time. </p><p> </p><p>Chas had a room mate. His name was Don. He was a nice guy and wore glasses. The glasses only appeared to look about -1.25 ish but somehow got the impression that Don's eyesight was much much worse than this script. Without broaching the subject Chas could tell that Don had poor eyesight. It was a kind if intuition thing.  </p><p> </p><p>Chas noticed that Don got up in the morning and went straight to the bathroom. If it was dark or there was poor lighting it didnt seem to bother Don.....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopic Grant</b>&nbsp;12 Oct 2009, 08:57</p><p>Opps,..I meant "With my contacts out.."</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopic Grant</b>&nbsp;12 Oct 2009, 08:55</p><p>Apple77, </p><p> </p><p>Without my contacts out (-3) I could focus a little in small increments at a time.  Closer up I could focus better of course.  Had I been introduced to GOC back then I would have had an entirely different experience wearing them.  I never wore them out of the bathroom.  Too much risk of them coming home and me getting caught.  That would be a nightmare trying to explain!  And if I had taken them, they would have known it was me with the other roomate out of town.  I've only lifted someone else's glasses once, and I've felt guilty about it ever since...  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Apple77</b>&nbsp;12 Oct 2009, 05:27</p><p>Myopic Grant, </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for the story. How much could you see with them? Did you wear them around or outside at all, or just in the bathroom? What do you think would have happened if you'd taken them? (OK - I don't steal but sometimes it's fun to imagine.) </p><p> </p><p>Any other stories out there? I'll think of some too! </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopic Grant</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2009, 18:53</p><p>Well, one that comes to mind that really got my heart beating out of my chest, (though it's not as elaborate as Apple77's), was when I lived on the East Coast and had two straight roomates, one a few years older, and the other more like 10 years younger; typical Frat Guy.  Anyway, the younger one had a cute friend in for the weekend once.  My roomate had told me that he was coming, so I knew he was going to be there, and it wasn't the first time he'd had a friend stay for the weekend, so no big deal.  Anyway, they were home when I came home from work, and I passed by them as I went into the bathroom, and said "hello" and introduced myself.  It was Friday night, and they looked dressed to go out on the town, and said they would be leaving soon.  As soon as I got into the bathroom, I saw a pair of thick frameless eyeglasses sitting on the toilet tank, sparkling under the light.  I guess my roomate's friend must have put them there after putting in his contacts thinking they would be safer there than in my roomate's cluttered bedroom.  The sink was too small, as was the bathroom, and there was no where else to place them.  If only he knew my obsession with glasses!  Well, of course immediately got aroused and my heart started beating frantically, and I started to salivate!  You have no idea how I wish I could have put them on, but they were right outside the door.  My luck, I would have dropped them I was shaking so much.  Anyway, they left shortly after I got through in the bathroom, and I made my way back to the bathroom to try them on.  From what I remember, he was very nearsighted; in the -8 to -10 range.  They looked really good on me, and had quite a lot of cut in.  They were gone a lot during the weekend, so everytime I was in the bathroom, I would wear them.  A part of me wanted to take them, and hoped that he'd forgotten where he'd put them, or even better, that he'd leave without them.  Of course Monday morning he was gone and so were the gorgeous glasses...my heavenly weekend had offically ended.   </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Apple77</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2009, 12:45</p><p>Thanks for the feedback - this was about 12 or 13 years ago. I haven't seen Chris for a few years but might guess his prescription is in the ballpark of -9 or -10. By the time he got to high school, he started wearing mostly contacts, though, so it's hard to know.  </p><p> </p><p>By the way, if this matters to anyone, Chris is straight - though when we were younger I definitely felt that there was some kind of tacit shared feelings, especially since the routine was that he always borrowed my spare glasses, etc. In retrospect I realize I had a total crush on him, but I doubt he ever would have consciously thought of it in those terms.  </p><p> </p><p>What was funny is that he so reliably had a glasses mishap on each trip that it grew to be something everyone knew was bound to happen, sort of like how the South Park character Kenny dies in every episode. ("It's already Sunday morning -- and Chris hasn't lost or broken his glasses yet? He has only a few hours left before we go home," etc.) Since everyone was kind of aware of it, it actually made it easier for me to talk about, since otherwise I would have been afraid of seeming too interested or even obsessed.  </p><p> </p><p>I'll confess that I used to love this thread and have been bummed that it has been so dry for such a long time. You could say I have a think for men losing or missing their glasses, and how that makes them a bit more vulnerable or makes the situation more intimate.  </p><p> </p><p>I'd welcome some more stories from others, and will see if I can find a chance to tell a few more myself. Let's work together to keep the stories coming!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Darren</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2009, 10:13</p><p>apple 77 thats a hot story! anymore? from other people? how about you myopic grant?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopic Grant</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2009, 09:49</p><p>I wonder how strong Chris' prescription eventually got.  Great story,..had a few like this myself.  How many years ago was this?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2009, 08:33</p><p>Apple77, </p><p> </p><p>That is a fascinating story. Gay or straight, the things that happen on scout outings are almost unbelievable. But more amazing is the fact that you don't even have to "make up" the stories. They just happen. I guess that's just a part of growing up.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Apple77</b>&nbsp;08 Oct 2009, 06:34</p><p>When I was a teenager I was part of a boy scout troop, and we used to go on camping trips at least once a month, even in winter. Of course many of the other boys wore glasses, some with fairly hefty prescriptions. I used to imagine what it would be like if one of them lost or broke their glasses while we were all out in the woods - that he'd have to spend the rest of the weekend semi-blind out in an unfamiliar place, helpless and relying on us for even the most basic things.  </p><p> </p><p>There was this one boy Chris, who was a few years younger than me (he was probably in 7th grade when I was in 8th, which felt like a big difference back then). He was adorable, with beautiful blond hair and an impossibly cute smile. He was also quite nearsighted for such a young boy, probably around -6, and I was more like -1 at the time. </p><p> </p><p>I didn't know yet that I was gay, but I knew that I really wanted to get closer to Chris. On one trip, I made sure to be in the same tent, with our sleeping bags right next to each other. The tents had maybe three or four boys in each, and it was a winter campout, so we tended to huddle our sleeping bags right next to each other to stay a bit warmer (though no one talked about this - it was just something that happened). It was so exciting to be that close to Chris and other boys, and I thought maybe I'd have a chance one night to "borrow" his glasses to check out how strong they were. The first night I saw that he put his glasses in a pouch in his sleeping bag before going to bed. It was pitch black, and after I thought everyone was asleep, I gingerly undid the velcro pouch to borrow Chris glasses. As I grabbed them, I felt how heavy and thick they were (compared to mine) and it was so exciting but also quite scary; if he woke up or anyone else saw, how would I explain? My heart was pounding. </p><p> </p><p>I went outside the tent with the glasses (ostensibly going to the out house) and put them on to see what I could see. It was a full moon with lots of stars, but as soon as I put on Chris strong glasses, the stars became totally cramped and blurry and I could barely make out a thing. I realize that Id left my own glasses back in the tent, so I had the choice to either walk to the outhouse in Chris glasses (and could barely see) or without correction (which was fuzzy but ok). I chose Chris glasses, which were so disorienting but exciting and made the simple, two-minute walk into an adventure, like being in a fun house. When I finally got back to the tent, I waited a while after zipping the door until I was sure everyone was asleep, and I slipped the glasses back where they came from. But not before I smeared some finger prints on the lenses, so I'd get to watch Chris clean them off the next morning before putting them on. It was all just too much for me! </p><p> </p><p>But the next evening something even more amazing happened. We were playing a game of capture the flag in a snowy field just outside camp. We used to play with a bit of tackling and rough-housing, and at one point I found myself tackling Chris to the ground (big surprise), and his glasses flew off and landed somewhere in the field, and sank into a pile of snow. We stopped the game and looked around for them with flashlights but to no avail. Chris glasses were gone, and though wed look again in the morning, we never actually did find them. Chris put on a big show about how blind he was, wondering how he'd get through two days with no glasses. I was secretly in heaven (I know its bad to enjoy another boys misfortune, but the thought of him walking around so innocent and needed was like a fantasy come true for me). As he squinted his way back to our tent, I offered to lend him my spare pair (again, around -1) for the rest of the weekend. I felt so sneaky, to be outwardly compassionate to him even as I was secretly enjoying his blurry weekend without glasses. And to see him wearing my spare -1s (when he was a -6) was also an amazing sight, because he had such a heavy squint behind them. I'm sure he could barely see a thing. Poor Chris, but he somehow never looked so cute to me as that weekend, trying to collect firewood or read from his scout handbook with essentially no correction. </p><p> </p><p>When the weekend was over and we all went home, Chris went out to get some stylish new frames with high-index lenses, which he wore to our next scout meeting a few days later, and he looked great. But what was kind of amazing is that this weekend became the first in a chain of glasses calamities for Chris on camping trips. On the next camping trip, he somehow misplaced his glasses the first day (apparently he put them in a different pouch than usual, and couldn't find them the next morning and was bare-eyed for several hours until they turned up), so again he borrowed my spare pair. And so it went on, each trip, one way or another, Chris managed to break his glasses, or leave them somewhere, or lose them at least part of the time. It became a kind of troop legend, and he had good spirits about it, and it worked its way as a trope into skits and jokes at campfires. Even a year later, when Chris finally got some contacts (to be sure I cant lose them! he announced), he made the mistake of leaving them in his tent overnight during a winter campout, and the solution froze, leaving the contacts unusable until they thawed out. </p><p> </p><p>This all sounds so slapstick that I wouldnt believe it if I hadnt actually been there. What I loved especially about it is that it seemed like I barely had to do a thing (I never stole or "borrowed" them other than that first night, so there was no risk of being caught)!  </p><p> </p><p>The funny thing is that, each time he lost his glasses, he always asked to borrow my spare pair, even though I know he could barely see a thing even with them. Why didnt he get his own spare pair, I wondered? Looking back on it, I wonder if he may too have been a nascent OO and he was looking for chances to borrow my glasses and to play the role of the vulnerable, needy blind boy. I was an all-too-willing accomplice in what may have amounted to a kind of shared, role-playing fantasy. It was all very exciting for me, even if I didnt fully realize what this was about until much, much later on in life.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Original Tony</b>&nbsp;18 Sep 2009, 14:02</p><p>THE ADVENTURES OF CHAS - PART ONE </p><p> </p><p>It was mid Setember and Chas was about to go off to College. Chas was a likeable kind of kid. He grey up as the only child in his family. He had quite a few friends in the road where he lived and got along fine with most people. </p><p> </p><p>Chas had always enjoyed good eyesight and had passed his driving test a year ago without any trouble. However, he was often heard to say things like he could not properly read road signs. His parents told him to get an eye exam but he did not go.Whilst Chas was a good kid he could be prone to exageration so his friends thought that he might be complaining about his sight for attention. </p><p> </p><p>However one day a group of friends decided to go and watch a baseball game.Whilst they were waiting for the bus Chas said he was not sure if his eyesight was up to scratch. Tony said "here, try my glasses on" Chas did so and was amazed at how clearly he could see things. Chas started to read road signs that he said were a complete blur to him before. Tony said that his glasses were about -1.25 dioptres and that Chas should go and get an eye exam. Chas said he would do so.  </p><p> </p><p>The friends went off to the game and Tony offered Chas to have a go of his glasses. Chas acceted and said that everything was so much more clear. Chas did not seem to want to keep the glasses on for long when there were other people about. </p><p> </p><p>[to be continued] </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mike</b>&nbsp;04 May 2009, 07:09</p><p>One of the girls in the office came in late because she had to stop in to renew her driver's license. She renewed with a restriction because she couldn't pass the vision test. The next day she went for her exam, and not surprising was prescribed glasses for distance. Today she picked them up and came in with great wireless frames that everyone had to try on. You should have seen the look on my secretary's face when she put them on and saw the bricks on the building across the street. Without the glasses they were a blur. Guess who is going later this week for an exam? Meanwhile she asked to borrow  the glasses for a show she is going to tonight!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kevin</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2009, 16:17</p><p>Not really full-time, but he wears them most of the time, if that makes sense.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2009, 15:45</p><p>Kevin </p><p>How often does your brother wear his glasses? Is he fulltime yet?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kevin</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2009, 15:29</p><p>Yeah, I have to put mine on before I get out of bed. I'm not sure bout Paul or Matthew, I'm sure I'll find out in the summer though. I remember one night (when I was drunk) I left my glasses on the floor, and when I woke up I couldn't find them, I nearly went crazy looking for them, I had to call my mother to help me. </p><p> </p><p>My little brother got his 2nd glasses today, not sure what prescription but most likely between -1.5 and -2.5. I tried them on but I couldn't see a thing, makes you wonder how I could see through that strength 10 years ago.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;09 Jan 2009, 09:55</p><p> </p><p>Kevin: </p><p> </p><p>The image of the three of you looking for your glasses in the morning is indeed a turn-on!  Do you (and perhaps your friends) put your glasses on in the morning BEFORE you get out of bed.  I do not take mine off at night until I have turned out the lights--and put them on the minute I wake up.  And, if I have to get up in the night to go to the bathroom, I put them on.  (In fact, recently I have even started sleeping with them on!) It may be weird, but I find all this quite exciting!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kevin</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2009, 14:13</p><p>Eustace, </p><p> </p><p>Hopefully!!

<p><b>Eustace</b>&nbsp;07 Jan 2009, 11:22</p><p>AleKevin: </p><p> </p><p>I have not spent much time surfacing "Borrowed Glasses Tales," but I just scanned it and particularly like your posts.

<p><b>Gino</b>&nbsp;29 Oct 2008, 16:20</p><p>My wife and her sister are both GWGs, though with a rather weak prescription. My wife is -1.50 in both eyes, I guess her sister's glasses are slightly stronger (somewhat more cu-in and she wears them more often). </p><p> </p><p>SO they're not full-time wearers, and it often happens that only one of them has glasses with her and they then need to share the glasses if having to look at some distant object(s). </p><p> </p><p>My wife has thin plastic frames, her sister's newest glasses are rimless. They're both very hot in their own glasses, and when borrowing each other's!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Original tony</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2008, 06:36</p><p>Ever borowed someones glasses and then placed them on the table and watched that person run thier hand over the table to find them?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Original Tony</b>&nbsp;25 Oct 2008, 05:39</p><p>Whilst at school at about 15 years of age we had a teacher who was about retirement age. We never saw him use glasses (either reading or distance). </p><p> </p><p>When he needed to look at something in close detail he would borrow the glasses of a felow pupil. The pupil wore glasses full time for longsightedness. Probably about medium strength. No one seemed to think it odd that the teacher didn,t get glasses or that it was strange that the teacher could use the glasses of a much younger person with ease.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Sue</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2008, 09:01</p><p>The opposite happened to me!  I got distance glasses  second year of high school. Sitting near the back of the room in English class the teacher walked by me about a week later, and asked me if I could read the board with my new glasses and I told her I could. She asked me if SHE could try them, and I said she could. A week later she came to class in glasses and wore them ft!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Myopic Grant</b>&nbsp;24 Oct 2008, 07:31</p><p>That would have been a dream come ture if that would have happened to me in grade school!  I remember once in 2nd grade I brought a mask to school that I'd made, and the only boy in our class at that point who wore glasses wanted to sneek up to the teacher with it on during some sort of activity time.  He asked if I would hold his glasses while he had the mask on, and of course I had instant excitement and my heart was beating out of my chest.  And yes, I tried them on when all the attention was towards him trying to scare the teacher.  Of course I encouraged him to do it to more people through out the day so I could have possesion of his glasses again for any moment I could...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kevin</b>&nbsp;23 Oct 2008, 15:24</p><p>Well she asked me to read the board and I couldn't, so she asked Paul to let me try on his glasses</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kevin</b>&nbsp;18 Oct 2008, 16:32</p><p>When I was 8 I couldn't see the board in class so the teacher got me to try on  Paul's glasses and I could see. So a few days later I went to the opticians and got a pair for myself. Paul had only recently got glasses so our prescriptions were pretty similar. Paul and I became friends - not sure if it was because of the glasses. </p><p> </p><p>A few months later another guy in the class; Matthew got glasses. Matthew and Paul lived in the same area, so they knew each other. </p><p> </p><p>We were all in the same class until we left school. As we grew up our prescriptions increased. By 14 I'd say we were all about -4. Sometimes we would try on each other's glasses even though we were all roughly the same strength. </p><p> </p><p>Now we're 20 and we're still friends. I don't see them as much now but we're all blind. I'm L-8.5 and R -8.75. Not sure about Paul &amp; Matthew but I guess they're pretty similar.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Minus Dude</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2006, 09:58</p><p>Forgot the 2nd act of borrowing Saturday night. A young guy always in glasses (gun metal wire frames, rounded, a little dated in color but the shape is good on him) nearly ran into me. I couldn't really say "Cool glasses, where'd you get them" so I tried another approach: "I wish I looked as good in glasses as you do!" His eyes got big &amp; off came the glasses to show me how the right arm stem opens more than it should (that explained why they sometimes sit crooked on his face) &amp; that it was his old boyfriend who... - then interrupted himself to say they were so old anyway. I grabbed them &amp; put them on - was surprised to find them only around -.75 or -1. The fag hag he was with said they looked good on him but they were in a rush to get upstairs. Next time I'll ask him to finish the boyfriend/bent glasses story &amp; try them on again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Minus Dude</b>&nbsp;29 Mar 2006, 09:52</p><p>Last weekend's bar activity. </p><p> </p><p>Friday night - 2 interesting guys - dark wired frame rectangular about -2 &amp; very light prescription on another guy with pale gold round glasses, but both left before I could get to them. Later, just as another guy was leaving I went over &amp; complimented his frames - he said he got them out of town &amp; thought they were DKNY - off they came, he looked at the maker on the arm, nodded &amp; handed them over. About -1.5 with some astigmatism, basic brown metal oval frames. </p><p> </p><p>Saturday night - missed out because I don't speak spanish &amp; thought it would be too much trouble to use my bi(lingual) friend to translate, but I was tempted - he had super cool approx. -1 drilled rimless &amp; the lenses were shaped like tv screens (with rounded corners); looked super on him. Another guy with boring glasses just happened to mention he's getting new frames this week, so that will be interesting. I have his old pegged at about -4. </p><p> </p><p>The brothers from up the coast were out but their pals weren't, they were looking for new friends so I introduced myself to them. One has drilled rimless, maybe -1.25 &amp; the lenses were like slightly flattened eggs, if the rounded part is up &amp; the pointy down. Looked something grandma would have worn 100 years ago but HOT on him! He let me squirrel off to the bathroom to ogle at myself after he told me I looked good in them. The other doesn't need glasses. Darn it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Minus Dude</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2006, 10:08</p><p>Good question! Some of it is my own laziness. I repeated my good luck at the bar again this past weekend, trying on 5 guys glasses again. Last week what so pleased me was that I went after a guy on the cuteness of his glasses even though he wasn't my type and we wound up getting along really well. His glasses by the way were sharply rectangular dark wire frames &amp; a single straight nose bridge, approx. -2.25 each eye. </p><p> </p><p>Friday night I ran into a straight guy who'd showed me his glasses a couple of weeks ago - he was there with his girlfriend this time. He looked at me &amp; I smiled back, then he scratched his head to figure out how he knew me. I could see the lightbulb go off &amp; he looked at his girlfriend, took off his glasses &amp; said My glasses look really good on him. An unusual statement - good thing she was drunk &amp; didn't care.  </p><p> </p><p>Only one attempt failed at getting a guy to show me his glasses. I didn't outright ask - that tends to be a conversation killer - I had the feeling I was interrupting him.  </p><p> </p><p>In the quiet bar I noticed a trendy young thing with drilled rimless glasses; up in the dance floor I saw him bored with his friends but without the glasses. I asked him if he was by chance the guy downstairs with the coolest glasses - he reached around behind him to a table, wove his fingers between many bottles &amp; simply handed them over to me to see. Very light prescription, plastic coated arms, the lenses were somewhat rectangular but very narrow in height. They sat so high on my nose &amp; were had so little height I was nearly looking at the bottom rim at eve level. </p><p> </p><p>What will next weekend bring? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude a/k/a glasses whore</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2006, 10:38</p><p>2 outrageously successful outings to the bar over the weekend - between Friday &amp; Saturday nights got 5 guys to let me try on their glasses. In reviewing each try on, I've come to realize the approach which is most successful for me. In each case the guy was average looking &amp; the glasses were fairly new. This worked with strangers &amp; friends. I'd approach them &amp; tell them how much I liked their glasses. As they were appreciating the compliment I'd ask them if they minded my asking where they got them - in all 5 cases it happened to be chain stores, even for more unusual frames. "Thanks for the tip - I'm going to have the check them out. Hope my prescription works in them - it's pretty high. Are they fairly light weight?" In all 5 cases without my having to ask, they guys took them off &amp; handed them for me to feel how light they were. Of course I went ahead &amp; tried them on. There's a large mirror near the men's room so I try to catch guys coming out of the men's room (hopefully they've washed!) so I can see how they look on me. Finally I genuinely thank them - they all seemed very pleased at the attention their glasses got. In once case I was brave enough to say to a real cutie I hoped if I got those frames I'd look a tenth as cute in them as he did. I find that most of the glasses I try on in the bar contain some astigmatism - makes sense, thinking of the smokey atmosphere irritating the less comfortable astigmatism-correcting contact lenses &amp; having more trouble seeing without their glasses if they would leave them out in the car.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Gus</b>&nbsp;31 Aug 2005, 21:02</p><p>Original Tony:  </p><p> </p><p>I occasionally wear 21 glasses over +15 contacts. When I do that, everything more than an inch or two in front of me is a total blur without my glasses. This is something I do for fun and can set things back to normal just by taking out my contacts, but I can understand how frightening it would be to a person who really is a very high myope if their glasses were lost or broken and didnt have another pair of with them.  I imagine most people like that would be helpless without their glasses.    </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Watcher</b>&nbsp;19 Aug 2005, 06:13</p><p>Well, Original Tony, it seems as if there's only two of us here, and if you won't produce anything then here's another tale. </p><p> </p><p>During my gap year between school I got a job at the local unemployment place. Pretty boring!  I had all the messy jobs, but every now and then someone wouldn't turn up and, after some training, I began to take some clients and process their applications. </p><p>There was one lad of about my own age who was always there week in week out with his girlfriend and they spent all their time in the waiting place snogging each other!  Really hot stuff it was, tongues down each other's throats and all that.  What made it doubly watchable is that he was a real myope with very thick, rimless glasses and the harder the two of them went the farther down his nose came his spex until they almost ended up on the girl!  All the staff knew them of course and, incredibly didn't mind - very tolerant they were.  One day Christopher and Helen (I had found out their names) came in as usual and, they had a long time to wait because we were busy, so they whiled away their time in the usual way.  It was a very hot day too and the sight of them going hammer and tongs really gave me a buzz, so much that my own spex started to steam up!  When I'd finished with the client I took my glasses off to give them a bit of a clean and, damn, the left lens just shattered in my hand! so I put them in the drawer.  By chance, Christopher's turn had come and he walked straight over to my desk, said Hi! and sat down.  I got out his file and began to peer at it, holding the papers up close.  Christopher immediately said, 'Don't you usually wear glasses?' When I said 'Yes, I'm very shortsighted' he got out of his pocket an identical pair of glasses to the ones he was wearing and said, 'Why not try these? I always have to carry a spare pair in case.'  They must have been around -10's because I had to shift them down my nose a bit to focus but they did the trick and I got on with the paperwork and sorted it.  When I'd finished I was going to hand him back his specs but he said, 'Well, if you can see through these you'll need to keep them so why not just hold on to them. So were are yours now?'  I opened the drawer and showed him.  He said, 'If you let me have them, I'll ask my dad to send them to his lab - he works for an optometerist and I'm sure he'll help.'  So, that's how we became good friends and I still see him and Helen when I'm home on vacation.  They live together and with me and my girlfriend we make up a fouresome and go out to clubs and parties.  We've just spent two weeks hiking and camping in the south of France and got really fit.  Christopher's going back to college to do some study.  He's got a real brain but was never encouraged at school.  He's talking about becoming a teacher but hasn't yet decided.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Watcher</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2005, 14:50</p><p>A Friend in need.  Part II </p><p> </p><p>When we got to the cinema we discovered that it was a sell-out - all showings fully booked!  Damn I thought that's finished off my plans. But David (I'd discovered his name by this time) said "Why don't we go down to the National Gallery instead - it's open till late AND it's free!"  So down we went and had a hilarious time with me peering at the cards below the pictures trying to read the names.  David then came to my rescue and said "You know you can borrow my glasses if you want."  "But then you won't be able to see the pictures," I told him.  "Oh that's ok, I've been here hundreds of times and know it back to front.  I come here often in the holidays and just sit in front of some of the pictures and drink in the wonderful art.  So you see, you can have the glasses if you want." "If you want", I thought, "too right, sunny boy!"  So for the whole of that afternoon I went round the NG almost in a dream wearing these heavenly glasses.  When we finally decided we'd had enough we went to the restaurant for something to eat (I paid, well, it was the least I could do for such generosity) and David didn't stint himself when choosing from the menu either!  Finally we decided to call it a day and so I handed him back his lovely glasses, but not before telling him, "David, you know I think you look so good in these, you really ought to wear them all the time.  I mean, you ARE quite shortsighted and isn't it better to be able to see properly?"  He blushed a bit when I said this and it was a little while before he said to me "Thanks, you know no-one's ever made such a nice comment about my thick glasses before.  I usually get called names, even at home as I'm the only one in my family who's short sighted.  You're the first person who has made me feel good about wearing glasses so, yes, I will keep them on now and just put up with the name-calling."  I said a few more words and wished him good luck and so we went our different ways.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Watcher</b>&nbsp;23 Jul 2005, 14:28</p><p>A Friend in need. Part I. </p><p> </p><p>Trying to find a bus from Blackheath back into town I came to a bus-stop. I just waited a while and along came a young lad of about 13 or 14 and so I asked him "Does the 15 bus go from here?"   "I don't know, he said, "it should tell you on the timetable."  I told him that I was very shortsighted and couldn't see properly and to my amazement he fished out a pair of rimless glasses and put them on, saying "I'm shortsighted too but don't like wearing these coke bottles all the time." They were pretty powerful too and we had a good joke over this and so I asked to try on the glasses so that I could read the times of buses for myself.  Well, it was just too coincidental - his myopia was about twice mine but I did like the feel of his glasses- so light too and comfortable.  I said that I'd never felt glasses like these that fit well and look good.  He was very flattered with what I said, but it was true and I meant every word.  The next thing the bus came along and he said "Here's our bus."  "Does that mean you're going into London too?" I asked. "Sure thing, I'm going to see a movie at Leicester Square", he said. Wow! I found myself asking, "Which one, because I'm doing the same thing!" </p><p>(I made this up on the spur of the moment because I thought if we went together I'd be able to ask to borrow his glasses again).  He named the movie and I told him that was my choice too so we decided to go together.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;18 Jul 2005, 09:01</p><p>my prescription? how timely you have asked, as I just had an appointment last week. for contacts, left -2.75, right -4.5 (a .25 improvement in the left eye) </p><p> </p><p>This caught me off guard at the bar a week &amp; a half ago. My friend Joe was at the bar but not his partner. I must have had plenty to drink not to have noticed this but Joe had to tell me earlier in the evening he'd broken his glasses at his partner's house &amp; his partner had lent him his glasses to wear out to the bar! Oh, once he told me this I had to take a good look. </p><p> </p><p>His partner's glasses are more current, simlilarly shaped rectangle wire frames, but with thinner wires &amp; a darker color. He looked good in them! I did notice him pushing them up on his nose all night - a nice reminder of the circumstances. </p><p> </p><p>He said he could see surprisingly well with them, just a little blur with the left eye. I "just happened" to know his parter's vision is -1.75 each eye. Under the pretext of saying I was going to get new glasses soon, I borrowed them from him &amp; check out how they looked on my in the bathroom mirror. I was wearing my contacts, so I also rotated them for an astigmatism test since I also found the left left blurred beyond just the numerical prescription. I walked back out wearing them &amp; he opined they were a good match for me; I returned them to him. I related that I thought there was some astigmatism in the left eye &amp; that's why he was having a little trouble.  </p><p> </p><p>I'd tried his glasses on weeks ago &amp; found he had alot of astigmatism - perhaps running in the other direction from his boyfriend's left eye astigmatism. </p><p> </p><p>Joe said it would be 10+ days until he got new glasses. Something to look forward in seeing in a week or two.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Watcher</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2005, 18:14</p><p>A Vision of lovliness (part II) </p><p> </p><p>For the rest of that summer I was in heaven. I managed to think up different ways of being with him - we went to the pub a few times and a couple of times went to the local cinema (sitting very near the front of course) but the highlight for me was to go with him to a football match. I asked if we could stand behind our own team's goal and Neil went along with this.  It meant that whenever the action was taking place in the opposite end, Neil couldn't see a thing.  Our team were really playing well and a lot of the time were attacking the opposition's goal.  Neil was beside himself and kept saying, "Just tell me what's happening!"  It was great for me to be his "eyes" for a while and, although I wasn't much interested in football I must say I enjoyed being the commentator that day!  Afterwards we went to his flat and watched a couple of movies on his giant TV screen before he drove me home.  It had been a great day for me!  We kind of lost touch for a while - I went back to our house in London and to school but then last Easter Neil rang up to ask me to go to his wedding as best man.  I was thrilled to be asked but all the while I was secretly jealous of the local girl he was marrying.  It was as if she'd stolen him from me and it took me a lot not to show my real feelings.  They have moved to the nearest town now about 12 miles away and I hear that Jenny is expecting a baby.  Maybe they'll ask me to be a godfather and that way I'll be able to keep in touch with them always.  If the new baby is a boy wouldn't it be tremendous if he grew up to be as myopic as his dad?  Now that would be really ACE!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Watcher</b>&nbsp;06 Jul 2005, 18:06</p><p>A Vision of lovliness (part 1) </p><p> </p><p>A couple of summers ago we had to renew all our window frames in the cottage in Dorset where we spend the summer.  A local carpenter was recommended and my father engaged him.  Neil was only 24 and a very good craftsman.  He was tall, slim with longish chestnut hair but what made me take notice was that he was amazingly short-sighted and wore huge brown, "aviator" glasses with the thickest lenses I'd ever seen.  He obviously had never heard of high-index!  I too was myopic but at only -3.25 Neil was way out in front of me!  I could hardly wait for him to arrive each morning and kept thinking of excuses just to talk to him.  I said that I was thinking about taking up a job as a carpenter and could I watch him work.  He didn't mind a bit so I hovered around a lot, asking questions and passing him tools and all the while just watching.  It was a hot summer and Neil took of his shirt a lot.  He had an amazing tanned body, fit and brown, so coupled with  his thick glasses all I wanted to spend my summer holidays doing was watching him!!  What I was hoping for was an excuse to try on his specs but was too shy to ask until I dreamed up a plan.  One day I went to my room and unscrewed one of the screws which held my left lens in my glasses frame.  I carefully placed the tiny screw behind the leg of my desk and went down with my "broken glasses" to show Neil.  He took them off me and brought them up to where he could focus on them.  I said, "I think the screw fell out but it's bounced along the floor of my room and I can't see it.  Will you come up Neil and look for me?"  Of course he ageeed and we went up but after crawling around for 10 minutes, both of us with our noses near the floor we gave up.  Then I asked, "Neil, could I borrow your glasses to try to have a look myself?"  He said ok and handed them over.  My fingers were trembling now and I put them on.  Gosh, there was a delicious swimming feeling as my eyes tried to accommodate the strong lenses.  I wanted to keep them on so I started a conversation asking Neil if He'd heard the local team's football result.  I knew he was a keen supporter and so that started him off telling me all about the game. All this time I just kept my eyes on him knowing that even though we were sitting only a couple of feet away from each other Neil couldn't see a thing and I had to look over his specs in order to see him. He was really nearly blind without his specs.  When he'd finished the account of the march I made a half-hearted show of looking for the missing screw (of course I knew where it was!) and eventually picked it up.  I couldn't focus on such a small object so asked Neil to fix my glasses for me which he did.  The lenses were now so finger-marked that he got out his clean hanky and polished them before handing them back to me and I too, reluctantly returned Neil's glasses.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lisa</b>&nbsp;11 Mar 2005, 11:49</p><p>Not sure if anyone else likes doing this. I am fairly shortsighted (-2.75, - 3), can can see well enough with glasses, and have quite high astigmatism so I begin to squint after a while. My boyfriend's right eye is a little lazy, so he needs to wear glasses sometimes. His prescription is quite weak. Recently I suggested that we swap our glasses. Admittedly, my vision is quite poor and I'm sure he gets dizzy from wearing my relatively strong lenses. It turns us both on though, especially when love-making. We just have to be careful not to worsen our lazy eyes.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2005, 08:47</p><p>Okay, after a LONG dry spell, opportunities to check out other guys glasses have finally picked up. At church I had worn my glasses instead of contacts &amp; at one point when I looked down at the hymnal my right lens fell out &amp; onto my chair. I took off my glasses after picking up the lens only to blurrily observe the screw fly off toward the floor. I suffered through the end of the service wearing nothing - my right eye's the "bad" one (at -4.5) &amp; contemplated if this might open any opportunities for glasses borrowing. </p><p> </p><p>Tom was in church &amp; I'd always wanted to try on his new glasses. He'd gotten them a few months earlier - the day he "debuted" them I was the only one to notice. I didn't ask to try them on as I was wearing my contacts - I wanted to wait for a time I was wearing my glasses so I could see him in mine &amp; I could see just how well I could see with his. But the chance hadn't arisen. They are titanium frames, oval. I was guessing from the lower amount of cut-in that his vision wasn't as bad as mine. After service I called him aside &amp; explained the problem. He thought initially this was joke - just a way to get him on the carpet on all fours - so I could do who knows what to him. I showed him my glasses so he could see I wasn't lying. (I was just being kind of sneaky!) He didn't see the screw so I asked if I could borrow his glasses &amp; look. He took them off &amp; handed them to me. They weren't as strong as mine - I'd guess -2.75 each eye but since I was only looking 2 feet away at the carpet I could see pretty well. We gave up after a minute &amp; I gave his glasses back. The only thing I wasn't able to do was try them on in front of a mirror! </p><p> </p><p>The next day I was back at church, early, for a meeting. I took another look for the screw &amp; to my amazement found it immediately. A happy ending to what I thought was a very successful (if brief) borrowing. I may have to contemplate loosening my screw more often! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

On walking over to the car, I somehow managed to bring glasses up, something about my eyes being sore with the breeze or something, but of course 'you wouldn't have that cos your glasses stop that'. He paused, took his specs off and said he understood what I meant. I almost asked to try the glasses on, but didn't say anything, then he put them back on.  </p><p> </p><p>We walk past a petrol station in the car park, he made a comment about the price going up to 81.9, I said 'Oh is it?', he said 'Yes, the sign over there says so'. I could see the sign perfectly, but said that my vision at night wasn't as good as the day, he said 'Here, try these' and handed me his glasses. I was so pleased not to have had to ask him. I took them and put them on, he asked if that was better. I reckon his glasses are -1.5 maximum, so in actual fact things did really seem sharper and have more clarity for me with them on. I lowered them on my nose, looked through them and then over the top, then pushed them back on fully. They were 'Storm' designer frames, very light and comfortable.  </p><p> </p><p>We carried on walking to the car, I was still wearing his specs. We got in the car, and I took them off and gave them back to him. He put them back on, and I said that my eyes had got used to his glasses in that short time and now things were a bit blurry!! Sure enough, he said 'You're driving, wear them if you want'! I said I wasn't sure as they weren't prescribed for me, but he insisted. So I put them back on, and wore them all the way home.  </p><p> </p><p>We got to his house, and he got out of the car, I was still wearing his glasses. I said 'Here's your glasses, don't forget', and he told me to wear them the rest of my way home, I could give them to him the following day. Naturally I agreed, so continued to wear them. When I got home, I took them off so my parents didn't see. I put them in my pocket and went to my room, then put them back on. I stayed up later, hours later than usual, so I could have time wearing these specs. Work the next day didn't start till 2.00pm, so I was at home alone all morning wearing these glasses full time. I was able to see fine with them on.  </p><p> </p><p>Sadly, the time came to hand them back. Now i'm a non-myope non-speccy normal person :(</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;23 Apr 2003, 19:13</p><p>Arguably, the one person who could make me forget about "toric contacts" Bob is... Brad the Bod. Who was out at the bar Saturday before last but - Brad! I'd been lazy that night &amp; wore my glasses instead of contacts. Brad noticed immediately &amp; commented that he like my new glasses. As if I could have forgotten... he remarked he still hadn't gotten new glasses after losing them 3 years ago. "That's a CRIME" I thought, but wasn't bold enough to say it. </p><p> </p><p>This past Saturday night he was there AGAIN! (With promises to be out more often this summer - YAY) A conversation turned to glasses &amp; he again remarked on how much he liked mine &amp; could he try them on? OF COURSE </p><p> </p><p>He wanted to see how they looked so he took them from me &amp; headed to the bathroom with the mirror. I followed blindly, with all meanings intended. He put them on &amp; looked in the mirror. This time I was bold enough to utter (out loud?) how seeing him in glasses just put him over the top... ...squinting as I was to watch him. He approved of how they looked &amp; was gracious enough not to comment on how strong they are or how one eye is much worse than the other. </p><p> </p><p>He told me about a coworker who'd just gotten (new) glasses spent $500 on them - I wasn't bold enough to ask him if he'd tried them on &amp; how they looked, how well he could see. Brad did say that he needed to get into the eye doctor &amp; get a new pair. YES! I mumbled some affirmative. </p><p> </p><p>More to follow? I hope so &amp; will keep eyescene posted.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;21 Apr 2003, 16:19</p><p>A tale with a different twist for me... </p><p> </p><p>At the bar a few weeks ago I noticed a tall gorgeous young man I'd seen from time to time. He was with someone but was distracted by a problem with his eye. He kept winking his eye &amp; then rubbing it. I glanced discretely watching the scene unfold. I winced in sympathy every time he dug his finger into his eye, assuming he had something behind a contact. </p><p> </p><p>Next time I looked up he was popping it out of his eye &amp; slipping it into his mouth to wash it off. Daring, in the semi-dark of a bar. Must have really been bothering him. I didn't see him try to put it back in but a minute later he was exiting the bar. About two minutes he was back wearing glasses (he certainly was prepared that night!). Clearly he didn't often wear them. They were wire frames - looked nice on him - but rode so high up on his nose. </p><p> </p><p>In what I'd call "lifecycle of the nose piece" I've noticed often that with new wire frame glasses on someone, the nose pieces ride the glasses a little noticeably high on the face; gradually the frames descend into a "normal looking" range. If the wearer keeps them long enough or is a little rough with them they ride so low that the bridge begins to rest on the nose &amp; the nose pads cease to be of any assistance. Sometimes the bridge even wears a crease in the nose. Sometimes I find that a little sexy. Especially on the bag boys at the supermarket - it's a telltale sign he'll be getting a new pair soon &amp; they'll all be trying them on.  :) </p><p> </p><p>End of that part of the story. Next morning in church I was a reader &amp; sat on the opposite side of where I usually sit. Had a FANTASTIC view all during service of a real hottie, Bob. He's gay but I'd have never guessed so (only hoped) if I didn't know him. Actually I barely know him. Intimidated by his great looks I couldn't ever figure out a way to start a conversation just so I could stare at him close range.  </p><p> </p><p>Part way through the service HE started winking his eye (no, not at me) &amp; poking it with his finger. This went on most of the rest of the service &amp; suddenly I realized I had the PERFECT way to enter into a REAL conversation with him. </p><p> </p><p>After service I asked him if his contact was bothering him. He seemed slightly surprised at my question but admitted yes, it was bothering him. Quickly I recanted the episode at the bar last night, hastily adding a "he was a very handsome guy, like yourself, ..." to my story. He was amused by the bar story. </p><p> </p><p>Bob explained he'd just gotten new disposable toric contacts &amp; put the new ones in this morning. Instead of the peak comfort from a new pair he expected, the one contact was irritating his eye &amp; felt like it kept slipping off center. That spurred us into a conversation about work &amp; whereabout we each lived. I was quite proud of myself for using my interest in glasses (even if this was an offshoot) to have a unique connection with someone. </p><p> </p><p>The next Sunday presented the perfect opportunity for this shy guy to approach Bob again &amp; ask him about his contact. He reported it had been inverted - once the lens was "reverted" (I'm not familiar with toric contacts, so this may not be the correct terminology) it was okay &amp; he'd not worn it long enough to cause an abrasion. </p><p> </p><p>Operation Bob continues. Last week at the end of the service without any planning or effort on my part he ended up next to me at the end of service when we all HOLD HANDS &amp; sing a closing song. Nice hands! Oh, forgot what song it was.   </p><p> </p><p>Toric contacts... is it likely he has astigamatism &amp; that down the road when we play swap glasses sex games we won't be able to wear each other's glasses comforably?  :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;05 Feb 2003, 16:55</p><p>This thread is not very busy. </p><p> </p><p>Come on folks get posting!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;04 Feb 2003, 06:41</p><p>About a decade age John ( left minus 2  right plus 4 huge astigmatism); and Jim ( at least minus 8 both eyes ) decided to go swimming. </p><p> </p><p>Whilst in the changing room I put my minus 1 glasses away and offered to keep both John and Jims glasses safe in my locker too. They agreed and handed them to me. John could see well enough to change. I tried jims glasses on. lots of power rings and mighty strong. I then put them away. </p><p> </p><p>We then walked into the pool and Jim did not make it obvious that he could hardly see. </p><p> </p><p>Once in the pool John swam up and down but Jim stayed close to the side and spoke with me. When John was only about four foot away from him Jim asked me where John was. I told him and he explained that his eyes were quite poor without glasses. </p><p> </p><p>After swimming we got back to the changing room and jim asked for his glasses. I delayed giving them to him for a while to see what his reaction we be. He seemed too embarassed to ask for them again and caried on dressing without them. I tried them on and then gave them back to him. </p><p> </p><p>I later found out that he had left an item of clothing there. He must have been confused without his glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;27 Jan 2003, 14:30</p><p>Missed opportunity? Within the last week I wrote about Brad the Bod. Hadn't seen him in AGES. I didn't go out Saturday night. Word reached me today that Brad was at the bar. Could he have read the piece I wrote &amp; recogized himself renamed Brad &amp; wanted to chat? I didn't change the circumstances any from what I recall - would he have remembered the episode from more than 3 year ago? I may never know. But thinking about it perked up the day. </p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, what I'd call a "backwards" borrowing at church (I was the lender, not the borrower). Art is hot - a decade younger than me but nice to know &amp; look at. At ease in contacts or glasses. I heard him mention he was having a little trouble seeing, having broken his glasses &amp; not being able to wear his contacts yesterday morning. Oh, I had to get to the bottom of this. He's got nice black wire frames with a low prescription. I've never had the opportunity to try them on.  </p><p> </p><p>As I was leaving I was able to initiate a conversation: "now which way are you driving so I can drive the other way?" "Oh, you heard..." The glasses had snapped at the center bridge &amp; he didn't know if a repair would show or not - &amp; from the cool frame style I'm sure they were expensive. I asked him just how his vision was (like I hadn't contemplated that any time he was wearing glasses &amp; looking at the distortion) &amp; he knew right away he was -1.75 each eye. I was wearing my glasses so I handed them to him to assure him that was LOW. He put them on &amp; looked toward the light with a moan of "geez your eyes are bad" (thanks, always nice to hear) &amp; didn't look directly at me so I couldn't see him; also kept his hands on the frames so I didn't get a good side look. I was close enough I could have seen with a squint. </p><p> </p><p>Fine - someday when Art's L -3.0 &amp; R -4.5 &amp; someone says something about his lenses being very, very high he'll see the light!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2003, 16:53</p><p>CONTD... </p><p> </p><p>John said that they semed strong even to him. </p><p> </p><p>Jim mentioned that he was awaiting a second back up pair. He did not work near the eyeglass shop which was some miles away but I did. I offered to pick the glasses up for him. </p><p> </p><p>About two days later I went to pick up the glasses. I would think that they were in cr39 lenses. They were very thick and stood out of the semi rimless frames that used to be Jim's old ones. They looked a nice frame but had protuding lenses. I tried them off and on all day. </p><p> </p><p>That night I hapened to go to johns house and jim was there. Jim looked at the glasses and was amazed himself at how strong the lenses were!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2003, 12:35</p><p>Quite a number of years ago i was in my friend Johns house when his friend Jim called in. </p><p> </p><p>Jim had gotten new glasses. Large rectangular plastic with yellow/brown tints. I complimented him on them and tried them on. they were mighty strong (about minus eight ). I looked in the mirror and loved the huge power rings. Whilst they were not the latest high index lenses they were not that thick. </p><p> </p><p>I offered them to my friend john to try on. John was about left minus 2 and right plus 4 with  a lot of astigmatism. </p><p> </p><p>TO BE CONTINUED.........</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;24 Jan 2003, 19:58</p><p>"Brad the Bod" </p><p> </p><p>I'd noticed Brad at the bar cause he looked a lot like an ex of mine. Brad tended to have some new style of facial hair every few weeks which made him especially interesting. One evening I watched him &amp; his "gang" head out for a quick trip out to the car (for hard liquor) &amp; realized: Oh! He's got glasses!  </p><p> </p><p>That quick flash filled in a gap of my own with my previously mentioned near look-a-like ex. That guy had worn extended wear contacts &amp; despised glasses. Said he'd get so tired of a pair he'd get a new pair of glasses every 4-6 month. (Oh what a collection he must have amassed!) From what he said he was a low minus (I'd guess between -1 &amp; -2) &amp; try as I might I could never get him to show me how he looked in glasses. He just jokingly swore they were all black plastic frames with the tape on the front.  </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, later that evening (after the hard liquor run) Brad wasn't wearing glasses. But one of his gang was. Watching over the next few weeks for those times they were out... it was clear that those had not been Brad's glasses. But Brad would borrow his friend's glasses for period of time. His friend's glasses appeared to be about -2 so this I found quite interesting. One night up on a sort of stage his gang was dancing in a sort of Congo style. I could see Brad talk with his friend &amp; then shake his head. His friend had to reach up to Brad's face to retrieve his own glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Another time, I watched him leave the dance floor wearing his friend's glasses, taking them off as he crossed the bar &amp; then keeping them in his hand as he ordered a drink. On another instance I watched him try on the glasses of a guy whose glasses were pretty strong. </p><p> </p><p>Brad started going out of town weekends &amp; I rarely saw him at the bar. BINGO - one night he was NOT with his friends &amp; wearing obviously brand new glasses (from the way he fiddled with them). Nothing fancy, just squared wire rims (rimless on the bottom) in a very low prescription.  </p><p> </p><p>Waited long enough.... &amp; eventually I met Brad through mutual friends (just about enough to say hi if we ran into each other) &amp; only very shortly before he moved away (ah, that's why he was going out of town weekends). I had one opportunity to view his house under the guise of "Oh, Jack said you'd really fixed it up. Could I see it before you move?" That snared me an invitation &amp; as I got the tour my eyes were keenly on the prowl for those glasses. </p><p> </p><p>In the bedroom there they were! Up on a high dresser on top a briefcase. Mr. Casual Minus Dude: "Hey, you wear glasses?" "Yeah." "Cool style. May I?" (Of course I had them half on as I asked that) </p><p> </p><p>Very low prescription was right, -.5 or -.75. Pretty much just sharpened up my sight with contacts, as I told him. I handed them to him &amp; he put them on to show me. I made sure I complimented him but he didn't leave them on. &amp; I wasn't bold enough to say "Man, everything's so amazingly sharp - can I keep them on for a few minutes?"  </p><p> </p><p>He noted somewhere in the conversation he was having trouble seeing at night while driving &amp; had gotten them for that. Perhaps he got his kick out of glasses that were stronger than his own need. </p><p> </p><p>I've seen him at the about every 6 months as he returns for a visit. Never wearing glasses! One night when he noticed I was wearing glasses I asked him why he wasn't. Said he'd lost them at that very bar! Naturally I had to check lost &amp; found, but no, they weren't there. (He lost them just weeks after my visit to his house, apparently) As interested as he has seemed in glasses, and as much as he makes a point to mention when someone gets new glasses or to compliment them, I've never been able to sustain a conversation about glasses. It's been a long time  since I've seen him. Maybe NEXT time!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;24 Jan 2003, 07:36</p><p>Quite a few years ago a family friend came to our family home. There had been a fancy dress party and there was a leftover costume. The friend was persuaded to put the animal costume on which involved covering his head in a hood. He took off his glasses which I would estimate were in the region of minus eight and placed them on the coffee table. Everybody then went into the other room. I stayed there and tried Jims glasses on. They were mighty strong with lots of power rings. </p><p> </p><p>I kept the glasses in my hand. It gave me quite a buz when Jim came back into the room. He dragged his hand over the table where his glasses had been in an effort to find them but they were in my hand. I waited for a minute and then told them I had them. He walked over to me and I placed them into his hand!  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jeffrey Bottom</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2003, 12:55</p><p>Tony </p><p> </p><p>Well, since Paul was a lot older, and much more experienced, he became a sort of Daddy to me, and I became his boy.  Since I was eager to please him, I suppose you could say I was a very willing pupil.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2003, 18:21</p><p>Nice post Jeff. What do you mean when you say you "became his pupil"?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jeffrey Bottom</b>&nbsp;03 Jan 2003, 09:20</p><p>My earliest memories of being facinated with glasses back to the age of nine.   </p><p> </p><p>The first one is of a boy called Tommy Hill who wore these tortoise shell minus two's.  All I knew was that I had to get to know him.  One day at lunch we were off by ourselves, and I asked him if I could try on his glasses.  He didn't hesitate, and when I put them on my face I thought I was in heaven.  I told him a little fib that I was able to see better with glasses, and he let me wear them almost everyday. </p><p> </p><p>At the same time a new boy moved in down the street.  His name was Mark, and we became playmates almost immediately.  Probably due in part to the fact that he wore....yes, you guessed it, glasses.  One day Mark and I were in the woods playing Army Doctor.  (Honest)  He was the patient, and yours truly was the MD.  I had him take off his glasses, and as was appropriate for an MD, I put them on.  This was all very exciting for me, and I had no idea what the exictement was all about until I hit my mid teens. </p><p> </p><p>One evening I was hitchhiking and a guy called Paul picked me up.  Paul was one of those so-called preditors.  He was around 40 at the time, and he was racially mixed with gorgeous black hair, creamy brown skin, and of course glasses.  I later discovered he had beautiful blue eyes.  The glasses were fairly strong, maybe in the -4 neighborhood with brown tortoise shell frames.  I could hardly take my eyes off him.  I started getting excited, but had no clue what it was about. </p><p> </p><p>Paul made some lame excuse to stop at his apartment, and immediatly poured himself a drink.  He asked my age, and wanting to appear more mature I told him I was 18, therefore old enough to drink.  He poured me a drink, and in no time flat I was feeling a bit tipsy.  I had no experience with alcohol at the time.  He turned on the water in the bathroom for some reason, and let it run, and then he gave me some photographs of straight couples having sex.  At that time pictures of this variety weren't easy to come by, and I'd never seen anything like them.  Needless to say, by morning everything came together for me, and I was wearing a spare pair of his glasses.  He even let me talk them home with me.  If I can remember the glasses he gave me were around -2.5's with what I would say was a fair amount of astigmatism. </p><p> </p><p>After that it seemed like I couldn't get enough of Paul.  Over the six  years that we had a relationship I became his pupil, and fell deeply in love with him.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2003, 14:28</p><p>Ok, here's a weird true story. It's my borrowed contact lens story. Yup, that's right. </p><p> </p><p>About 10 years ago I met a tall, gangly, rather good-looking Swiss boy in a night club; he was 23 and very sexy indeed. I took him home a couple of times and enjoyed the sex, even though he didn't have glasses and there was no sign of contact lenses. </p><p> </p><p>But I wasn't looking hard enough. One morning, he started rubbing his eyes and when he turned sideways I saw the line you get with gas permeables. And I was sooo excited, because of course I had no idea what his eyesight was like and it was fun guessing. </p><p> </p><p>I put off asking him until we were in bed one night. He grinned sheepishly and said he was wearing his contacts, and was quite happy sleeping in them. I said, "Are you short-sighted or long-sighted?" and he replied, as I hoped, "short-sighted." Then there was a pause, and he added, in his soft Swiss German accent, "very much". </p><p> </p><p>Wow. </p><p> </p><p>He said he hadn't brought his glasses to England on this trip, but he promised to bring his contact stuff and take his lenses out next time he stayed. Which he did. It was so exciting, watching him sit on then end of the bed and pop out the little blue lenses and put them in his case - and then knowing that he couldn't see!  </p><p> </p><p>We were noth pretty drunk, and in the middle of the night I did something I'd never have done sober. I took his case into the bathroom, fished out a lens, held it up to the light and looked with delight at the minification. Then, unable to stop myself, I popped it into my eye. Everything blurred, but I could just accommodate, so that meant somewhere around -5. After some trouble I managed to get it out and back into the case. Imagine if I had dropped it down the sink! How would I have explained it? It still makes me shiver... </p><p> </p><p>The next morning I went down to fetch the newspaper and we lay in bed reading it - but he explained shyly that he would have to hold it rather close. </p><p> </p><p>We were together for a few months and I milked the opportunity for all it was worth: I got so much enjoyment out of his myopia.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;02 Jan 2003, 07:36</p><p>Not so long ago I visited a Government building to advise upon some important issues.Whilst I was there I was given the room of a very senior person to work in. </p><p> </p><p>I looked inside the desk and found some strong plus lensed glasses which were probably spare ones for reading.I tried them on in the john knowing that this guy was away from the office. The next week I did the same. </p><p> </p><p>A week later I had taken the glasses together with the case out of the desk and had them in my hand. With that the guy who's office it was came into the room. I kept my both hands under the desk and he asked my advice.I felt very shaky and nervous. He went to get some coffee for me and I placed the glasses back in the desk. </p><p> </p><p>A close shave !</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2002, 17:57</p><p>Well, a similar story to my first story. This involves the second guy I knew with a strong prescription.  </p><p> </p><p>A number of years ago, about five years ago, I was out and about in downtown Philadelphia, also known as Center City. I was socializing with a friend outside a local gay coffeehouse. Usually uncomfortable introducing myself to strangers, I was friendly and said hello to this guy who said he was visiting from Chicago. The guy was nice, and I asked if he was enjoying his time in town. He said he was, but hadn't seen the bars. After talking for a bit, this guy, my friend and I went bar hopping. The interesting thing is that this guy, let's call him mr. tourist, had poor night vision, so he asked to hold onto my arm to get around. I later found out he wore contacts, but given that my friend was with us I didn't want to ask more.  </p><p> </p><p>Well, we entered one bar and mr. tourist had difficulty seeing around. At one time he tripped in the bar, but somehow it appeared that I was not walking straight, and one of the bouncers thought I was drunk. I had to prove that I was sober. We had a nice time walking around that night, and he felt comfortable on my arm. Thankfully my friend later decided to head home, as he didn't get my clues that I was interested in talking privately with the tourist. So, mr tourist and I chatted privately and i found out he had very poor vision, very nearsighted, but didn't have his glasses with him, they were back at the hotel. After a bit, we parted ways, but he gave me his email address. He told me that he was dating a woman, so I was wary of proceeding any further.  </p><p> </p><p>A year or so later, I was going to visit England for my cousin's wedding in Manchester. At the time, he had mentioned that he was living in London working for the past few years. We planned to meet up in Manchester the weekend of the wedding. It was interesting, as we met up in the light, early in the evening, but of course as it got darker, he held on to me. After going bar hopping, we decided to go to his room. We went up and made out for a bit and talked. Somehow I asked if he had his glasses. He felt uncomfortable taking out his contacts and wearing the glasses and said that he didn't like how he looked in the glasses. I told him I thought he'd look cute and mentioned my attraction to guys with glasses. He took out the lenses and put on the glasses. He told me they were like -10. I asked if I could try them on. Well, they were very odd to see through. I asked what he could see bare eyed. He said he could see little colors, but nothing else. He didn't even squint. I asked why. He stated that it didn't help. I played the hide and go seek game again, and he couldn't even begin to find them, so I gave him the glasses back. I so enjoyed kissing him when he was wearing his glasses. Unfortunately, he had a cold so he coughed a lot. After a few hours I realized it was too late to take the train back to the town I was staying about 20 minutes outside of Manchester. I couldn't stay over at his hotel room as my cousin's wedding was the next day in the late morning. So after chatting a bit more, we tried to call a cab, but there were none around to be dispatched. Luckily one appeared on the street. We parted ways after I took a few photos of him in the glasses. I headed back to the hotel where my family was staying. People looked surprised to see me get home so late at night. I headed up to my room and went to sleep. I kept up with the guy via email. He told me that he was heading back to Chicago in a few months. At that time, I then emailed him and he told me he was dating the same woman he dated prior to moving to London. I was bummed, and sadly after some time lost his email. I wonder where the photos I took went. I do fondly remember the time i shared with him.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2002, 07:58</p><p>DNBursky -  </p><p> </p><p>How wonderfully bold you were with your boyfriend! You're an inspiration!! </p><p> </p><p>I am 39 &amp; have been interested (which later I could define as attracted) in guys with glasses as long as I can recall. </p><p> </p><p>My prescription is nearly the mirror image of yours, if I recall correctly from a post of yours. Left is -3.0, right is -4.5. </p><p> </p><p>I have more stories to write but the rush of the holiday season has prevented me from focusing in (so to speak) on writing. Any more glasses experiences to share, DN?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;28 Dec 2002, 07:56</p><p>About 14 or 15 years ago when I was in school I resolutely refused to wear my glasses full time, even though my rx was about -2.50 with astigmatism of -1.00, so the blur was quite severe.  I would put my glasses on as I arrive in school, leave them on all day, but as soon as the bell rang for the end of school off they would come and I would walk home in a blurry haze.   </p><p> </p><p>Wearing glasses for sports lessons was distinctly frowned upon, even though this meant that I was unable to see what was going on or who was on my team.  I would go to the sport lesson wearing my glasses but had to hand them in to the teacher with valuables such as watches. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway one particular lesson we were playing badminton indoors and all the valuables had been left in a box on top of the heater at the side.  The temptation of my glasses sitting in the box was too much for the Sports teacher.  He decided to try them on.  When I went to collect my glasses at the end of the lesson the teacher commented on the strength of the lenses and asked if I could see without them.  After this event I was allowed to keep my glasses on for sport if I needed to.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>DNBursky</b>&nbsp;27 Dec 2002, 22:12</p><p>I have been inspired so I will tell my story about one of my first boyfriends. </p><p> </p><p>In 1992, I was 20, and met a guy at a local college dance. At this time, I found guys with glasses cute, not realizing others also had this interest. Slowly, I dated this guy, Jeff. Sometime during one of the dates, he said he wore contacts. I was thrilled, that meant he probably wore glasses when not contacts. He stated he had very poor vision. I asked him if sometime he could wear the glasses for me. Well, I was so excited when the date came. He showed up in -9 or so glasses, rather big plastic frames. I said he looked cute, he said he felt he looked funny and was embarrassed. We talked for a bit, and since I was comfortable with him, I asked him if I could see the glasses. I tried them on for a sec, woh, they were strong. I was probably a -2 or -3 and didn't wear my glasses full time. I then was sneaky and hid his glasses. He said it was not funny and much like he was blind, he felt around trying to find the glasses, but couldn't. After a minute or so, I gave them back. A few minutes later, I asked him to read a TV Guide without his glasses. He said of course that he couldn't. I, in my at times, hyper personality when excited, pleaded with him, if that's the word. He took off the glasses, but kept them close, and his eyes were basically on the paper reading the tv guide word for word slowly as each word required him moving the page. It was adorable. I never forgot him, and how sweet he was. I'll tell other stories in the future. I am curious how old all of you are. Not that I am agist, in the least, I just am trying to figure out how old you are compared to your contemporaries you mention in your stories.  </p><p> </p><p>David</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2002, 06:39</p><p>In the late nineties I went to call on my friend John. ( left = -2.25 ; right = + 4 high astigmatism). </p><p> </p><p>He had been down to the ocean the day before with his girlfriend. It was a bright sunny Saturday morning and he had ben cleaning his ground floor apartment. He was in a good mood and barefoot. </p><p> </p><p>He asked me to do him a favour. "What?" I replied. He explained that he had gotten lots of thorns and splinters in his feet. </p><p> </p><p>"Sure" I exclaimed. I told him to sit down on the floor with his legs outstretched.I picked one of his feet up and noticed that there appeared to be many thorns in it. My glasses were in the car. I asked to borrow his glasses. I perched them on my nose and looked mostly over the top of them. I told them that I could see much better. I picked out all the thorns and massaged his foot. Then I turned to the next one and repeated the operation.  </p><p> </p><p>Next I checked his legs over and rubbed them to make sure that there were no thorns left in them.Afterwards he made us coffee. After I drunk the coffee I told him I still had his glasses on and handed thdm back to him.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;13 Dec 2002, 07:33</p><p>Going back to the very early eighties I went to call at my friend John. He was outside of the house washing his car. He had his newish glasses on. Aviators which had now come in to fashion and looked really cool. They were quite large as this was the fashion. </p><p> </p><p>He still had and old pair that he used for work and he generally only put his new pair on when he went out. </p><p> </p><p>I went into the bathroom and sneaked a look through his old glasses. They were almost the same as the new ones but with slightly thicker frames and slightly weaker lenses. They were also gold aviators but with a difference. The old ones had nose pads while the new ones did not. I noticed that one of the nosepads ,including the metal stalk, had broken off from the metal frames. </p><p> </p><p>Whilst I had tried both sets of glasses on in the bathrrom I would like to take them home with me and try them out whilst walking. I grabbed my opportunity. I took the glasses in my hand and went outsude.  They were left - 1.75 right + 4 with high astigmatism. I presented them to John and said that i had noticed that he had broken his glasses. "Yes" he said "They are my working ones. Now I have to use my best glasses for work because I'm useless without them" he added.  </p><p> </p><p>Quick as a flash I said that I would take them to my workplace where I knew somebody in a workshop who could fix them. He agreed and I soon left. </p><p> </p><p>I drove down the street. This was the very first time I had gotten someones glases to try on in my own time. I stopped the car and tried them on. they seemed mighty strong to me. For one moment I wanted to know how it would be to need glasses like this. The best I could figure that being without them would like a normal sighted person wearing them. I had perfect vision at the time. </p><p> </p><p>I took them home and enjoyed trying them on. </p><p> </p><p>I found some soldering gear and managed to fix them myself. I don't think the repair lasted many weeks but it served my purpose. </p><p> </p><p>Halcion days****************************</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>teah</b>&nbsp;11 Dec 2002, 19:10</p><p>i think the reality-inspired fantasy is a really great idea minus-dude! great story!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;11 Dec 2002, 18:51</p><p>A couple of Octobers ago I'd taken Friday off. I combed the Lake Coast enjoying the beauty of the foliage &amp; doing some early holiday shopping. I was in a GREAT mood. I'd worn my contacts all day &amp; they were a tad dry by 10pm but my return trip took my nearly right past the bar in a seasonal resort gay bar complex so I thought I'd take a break &amp; see what was happening. With the time change it was a little later so there was a small crowd there. </p><p> </p><p>The first dude I noticed was a guy about 25 talking to an older guy at the bar. He had small silver oval glasses on the bar which he put on occasionally, taking them off within a few seconds. He wasn't bad looking, just kind of "awkward." Awkward Alvin, I'll call him. He did move around a bit &amp; I was only feet away from him at the edge of the empty dance floor as I watched him pull out his glasses &amp; put them on, only to put them away again. No opportunity to speak with him; I wouldn't have minded trying them on after telling him how nice they looked. </p><p> </p><p>Later a slightly older man, Bill, with beautiful prematurely grey hair &amp; as tiny eye-shaped glasses as I'd ever seen came over. New guy in small crowd, everybody notices. They were bifocals, in such tiny frames. There was a double "bridge" of metal that made the glasses look like a figure eight. Unusual frames I'd not seen before. At about the same time a very hot guy who knew Bill joined us. His name was Tom. He was taller than us, about 6'1" with short dark hair &amp; a very nice build, if on the thin side. He looked totally straight which was an attraction. </p><p> </p><p>After some small talk - and since I knew I'd unlikely ever see them again, if I got glasses-nutty, I remarked on how cool Bill's glasses were - and they were the tiniest lenses I'd seen. He was flattered to the point of admitting they were even bifocals. I told him I couldn't believe they could be (despite the obvious line) &amp; he took them off to show me. The primary lenses were plus with astigmatism, the lower with a stronger plus prescription with astigmatism correction.  I asked if I could try them on. I couldn't see with them but hey, any glasses experience is fun. "Man, try these on" I said to Tom, who obliged. Oh, Tom looked so hot in glasses - he could only wear them for a few seconds with a totally blank look on his face. </p><p> </p><p>As Tom took them off he remarked: "I've got glasses - kinda like these for night driving." As he took them off &amp; handed them back to Bill he reached down to his Dockers pocket. MY HEART LEPT. HE'S GOING TO SHOW US!!!!! </p><p> </p><p>But he pulled out a pack of Marlboro Lights &amp; excused himself to the bar to get matches. Very good for those with the nicotine kink but a big disappointment for those with the lens kink. The magic was gone &amp; we all went our separate ways. </p><p> </p><p>Now, if only.... the bar scene with alcohol running freely portended glasses-wearing as it does for smoking. Light smokers chain. Those who don't usually smoke start bumming em.... </p><p> </p><p>REALTY INTO FICTION: </p><p> </p><p>As Tom took them off &amp; handed them back to Bill he remarked: "I've got glasses - kind of like these for night driving. He reached down into his Dockers &amp; pulled out a pair of copper oval glasses with a light prescription. As he put them on he said: "I started wearing them in the bar after a couple beers but I don't notice so much difference anymore so I don't bother much." </p><p> </p><p>He put them on &amp; looked fantastic. Bill complimented &amp; Tom said to me: "I'll bet you'd look in these." He took them off (darn it) &amp; handed them to me. I put them on &amp; my tired eyes relaxes - they felt SO good! Both Bill &amp; Tom agreed: "You got to get frames like that, they're you, man!" </p><p> </p><p>The bar mirror was off to our left; I stepped towards it to see them &amp; the others followed. We were at the edge of the bar Awkward Alvin was sitting at. I did indeed like them &amp; Tom said to Alvin: "doesn't this guy look good in glasses?" Alvin put on his glasses &amp; agreed. </p><p> </p><p>Tom: "Did you get new specs, Al?" </p><p> </p><p>Alvin: "Yeah, but I think they're too strong. My old glasses didn't seem to make the difference they used to &amp; when I was retested I was surprised to find a big jump in my prescription. But I think these are too strong!" He took them off - AGAIN &amp; set them on the bar. Tom picked them up &amp; tried them on. His face lit up &amp; he looked around the bar. "Man, I can't believe the difference they make!" He looked in the mirror &amp; we all told him those were the frames for him. </p><p> </p><p>I handed Alvin Tom's glasses &amp; he (awkwardly) put them on, saying: "Now this is how I remember seeing the first time I put glasses on."  </p><p> </p><p>Tom &amp; Alvin looked at each other for a minutes &amp; said almost in union "We ought to trade!" </p><p> </p><p>Bill &amp; I concurred that each others' frames better suited each other &amp; after several tries of tipping the glasses up &amp; down to test the correction Tom &amp; Alvin agreed. Tom asked me to try on Alvin's so he could see them on another guy's face &amp; I obliged. They were about -1.25 each eye, just out of my range to accommodate comfortably. "These make my eyes hurt just a bit; yours are comforting for my tired eyes" I said, handing them back to Tom, but grateful for the chance to try them. </p><p> </p><p>Tom took Alvin's glasses back &amp; put them on "oh, I like these so much! Alvin, let (MinusDude) wear mine again." Alvin handed them to me &amp; I put them on. My eyes &amp; face visably relaxed. Tom said to me: "I'd really like to have dinner with you tomorrow night at an Italian restaurant here in town. Would you be willing to drive back up here?" OF COURSE! </p><p> </p><p>Tom: "Alvin, I don't want to put you out but I'd like to keep trying these glasses - could we make the switch tomorrow? (MinusDude) needs to get going but his eyes are so tired - can you get by without glasses til tomorrow evening? I'd feel better if he wore those for the hour &amp; a half drive home." </p><p> </p><p>Alvin: "Perfect. I got a ride with my pal Jack so I don't have to drive home." </p><p> </p><p>With everything set Tom walked me out to my car. We figured out the coordinates of my return the next day &amp; he gave me a wonderful good night kiss. Our respective glasses clicked! He wasn't a hairy guy but his five o'clock shadow sure felt good. If he didn't shave in the morning he'd have a nice scruff. A couple of day &amp; he'd have a fine goatee. I headed home with eyes totally relaxed &amp; new pair of glasses to peruse before our romantic dinner the next night.  </p><p> </p><p>IF ONLY! :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2002, 17:16</p><p>During the early nineties I called to my friend John's house.He was dressed up in football gear and just about to go through his backyard to the football field and changing area. However he was allready changed! I said that I would go with him. </p><p> </p><p>He took his glasses off and put them on the kitchen counter. They were approx. left = - 2.5  ; right + 4 with lots of astigmatism. </p><p> </p><p>I picked the glasses up of the counter and told him that he may need them afterwards especially if we went on to  a bar. He agreed and I put them in my pocket. </p><p> </p><p>We got to the venue which was a short walk away and the game started. During the game I was able to try them on. They were rectangular and gold in color with brown reactalite (changing color) lenses). </p><p> </p><p>At the end of tne game we went to the changing area. John took his cloths off and went to shower. We agreed to go to the local bar after the match. I went on ahead in my car which I had gotten from the parking lot. I got to the bar and kept the glasses on to see if anyone would notice. I also wore  glasses and nobody noticed that they were not mine. </p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile John had agreed to get his car from the parking lot and drive his friend home before he joined us in the bar. John did not have his glasses as I had left for the bar and had them in my pocket! He walked a short distance to his home and got his spare glasses. Later he joined us and  I explained that I had his glasses. He said he had gotten his spare ones. We both tried both sets of glasses on to see how different they looked upon us and then I handed them back to John. </p><p> </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;08 Dec 2002, 08:49</p><p>Teah - I dont really know but most people that I know have similar rx in each eye. There is one other peson I know with a discrepency. I would estimate her rx as left =-1.5 right= +6. </p><p> </p><p>Tony </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>teah</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2002, 18:13</p><p>just out of curiosity, how common is it to have such a discrepensy between the eyes? especially regarding one minus eye and one plus eye? </p><p>thanks</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2002, 17:47</p><p>During the very early eighties I had a friend named John. He wore aviator gold framed glasses. The left lens was about minus 1.75; the right about plus 4 with a huge ammount of astigmatism. The frames were not as fashionable as they had been and John mentioned on at least one occasion when I brought the subject up that he had not had an eye test for about three years. Also his spare pair had become mangled beyond repair and his current and only pair had suffered a few incidents and would often need to be fixed when they would sometimes fall apart. </p><p> </p><p>I mentioned to John on a number of occaisions that he should get new glases and I also impressed upon him that reactalite glasses, that changed darker with the light, were very cool. Theese were quite new and trendy then and I fancied trying a pair on. </p><p> </p><p>The eye doctor and eyeglass shop that John used was some distance from where John lived but happened to be where I worked. After discussing the above for a week or two I was in my car with John one day when I casually anounced that I had made an apointment for him to have an eye test. I promtly gave hime the appointment card. It was for the next Saturday morning. </p><p> </p><p>The following Saturday night I called to Johns house. He told me that he had undergone an eye test that morning and that his rx had gone up very slightly. He had ordered rectangular brown frames with matching brown lenses. Wow ! Cool up to date glases. I fancied trying them on.He informed me that they would be ready in about a week. </p><p> </p><p>I waited about fiove days and called at his house every night. He worked long hours and would have some difficulty in geting to the eyeglass shop. </p><p> </p><p>One night I called to his house and he told me that the shop had rung him and told him that the eye glasses were ready.I told him that I would go there the next day and collect them. Initially he was reticent because he thoght he should go there to try them on but I said that if they were not correct he could always go back for a fitting. John agreed and gave me a cheque to pay for them. </p><p> </p><p>The next dat I went to the shop and asked for the glasses. The girl in the shop went to put them on me! I explained they were not mine but it would have been fun. I examined them and gave her the cheque. </p><p> </p><p>When I got outside I put them on. Wow everything looked wierd. I looked in a shop window. They looked so cool with the matching brown lenses.I wore them off and on all day. </p><p> </p><p>That night I went to Johns place to give him the glasses but told him I was so sorry because I ,must have left them on my workdesk. He queried if they were safe and I told him that they were. They were in fact in my car. </p><p> </p><p>I tried them on the next day and told my co workers that I had collected strong glasses for my friend.Little did John know that lots of people had tried them and were surprised at how strong they were. </p><p> </p><p>The next evening I gave them to John. He loved them. I told him how good they looked on him. They looked quite good on me I thought! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2002, 10:31</p><p>Forgot to mention that Al. did not notice that I was wearing glasses that were not mine and which I did not need!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;07 Dec 2002, 10:27</p><p>Back in the early eighties one of my house mates had very trendy rose tinted large glasses. They were the height of fashion then and the rose tinted view through them was stupendous. </p><p> </p><p>It was my turn to drive us students in to college. I dropped the others off and drove into town do do some shopping. I did not have lectures untill about two hours after the others. </p><p> </p><p>Whilst driving in to town I noticed a faux crocodile skin glasses case on the front shelf of my car. Yes they were Dans glasses. I got in to town and parked the car up. I placed the glasses in my outside pocket. As I walked down the road I fished the case out and put them on. Wow everything rose tinted and about minus 2.5  I would think. I checked in a shop window. I looked so cool in them. They would have been great even if they were planos but the rx just added to the experience. </p><p> </p><p>I kept them on and walked about. I figured nobody would know me. In those days I had perfect eyesight and didn't need glasses. It was not a summers day and I don't think people would wear sunglasses in say March. Not to walk about in anyhow ,although it was a sunny day. </p><p> </p><p>I walked out of a shop and straight towards a fellow student Al. He was with his parents who had come in to town to meet him. Al knew Dan and I wondered if he would notice if I was wearing Dan's glasses. I sure would feel dumb being caught with someones glasses on with an rx I didn't need. </p><p> </p><p>I thought it would be too obvious if I took them off. I could not see clearly but shock hands with both Al's parents. </p><p> </p><p>I went back to college and handed the glases back to Dan. He said he was sure glad that I had handed them  back to him.He didn't wear them full time in those days but he does now and I don't think his rx has gone up much. </p><p> </p><p>Fond memories..........................</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2002, 04:58</p><p>Christy and MinusDude - Nice postings.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;06 Dec 2002, 01:17</p><p>Minusdude - you've never broken anyone's glasses? I've posted this a couple of times - but I'll mention it again. I was once hitch-hiking and a guy pulled up for me. He was wearing glasses - but he took them off while I got in the car. I had a large pack and he told me to throw it over onto the back seat. Further down the road we came to a junction and he couldn't read the signs. I was no help - as my vision was a bit fuzzy but I hadn't yet got glasses. </p><p>"Where are my glasses?" says the guy, looking all around for them. "I think they might be on the back seat; could you check?" </p><p>Sure enough - they were on the back seat - underneath my heavy pack - totally mangled with one of the lenses popped out. I thought he'd throw me out onto the roadside - but no. </p><p>"Wearing glasses is a pain," he said, "And I hardly ever wear them anyway - except for driving!"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;05 Dec 2002, 19:54</p><p>Good history, Tony! I think I'm going to have to start going to car shows! I never had the experience of breaking a dude's glasses, you're one up on me. </p><p> </p><p>I have kinda fixed 2 pairs... the 2nd experience was awkward. I'd been working as a temp &amp; had the uncanny (&amp; in that company the unique) ability to sense one of the moodiest women's day-to-day demeaners like no one else in the company could. When no one else could figure her out I'd come in after lunch, take one look at her &amp; know what to ask. One day she wasn't wearing her bifocals &amp; had a patentic look on her face. Her lens had come out. I was able to slip it back in in seconds &amp; was the hero of the day. But it was very cagey since it wasn't a dude's specs. </p><p> </p><p>Roll back a decade to my pal Rod. He'd admitted to wearing glasses but never showed them. Drove me someone bare-eyed... should I have been worried? One day he mentioned they'd been broken - but it was just that a lens had slipped out. I told him I was adept at putting lenses back in &amp; he reluctantly allowed me to try. They were the exact same aviator frame as mine but one size larger. I slipped the lens in with ease &amp; he was AMAZED. I slipped them on to find a very low prescription but with enough astigmatism correction I could not adjust to them. </p><p> </p><p>This was especially frustrating some time later when he stayed with me &amp; they were left in their handsome brown faux-leatherette case often when he wasn't around - but I couldn't do more than hold them in my hand - my eyes hurt too much to try them on. He was wearing them more for a job which required a lot of reading, so they sat out all over the apartment here or there instead of being hidden in the desk as they had been earlier. </p><p> </p><p>In that same era I had trouble with a window in my apartment (this was the apartment next door to the hot Rick). I put in a service request &amp; one day came home from work to find the slip completed as work done on the table. I checked out the window &amp; it worked, WHOAH on the occasional table next to the window there was a pair of glasses! </p><p> </p><p>I immediately figured the repairman had left them. Gold wire frame, larger-than-typical aviators with a light tint &amp; a low prescription. Heaven! I slipped them on &amp; was very disappointed to find a lot of astigmatism correction. I looked in the bathroom mirror with them but couldn't focus. All I could do was admire them... about half an hour later he showed up to collect them. Sheepishly. He was pretty nice looking... he'd have done well with a more current pair of frames! </p><p> </p><p>Another guy who tended to leave his glasses lying around was our company's computer tech Bry. Bry wasn't geeky (too filled out, though not overweight) but nothing special to look at. He had dated large silver wire frames with a slight tint. Soon as he'd sit down at a computer off they'd come. Once he left them for a few minutes at my station &amp; I was able to try them on. VERY low minus but as they were glass lenses &amp; they were quite heavy. One day he even admitted that often he'd get a call from a company saying he'd left his glasses there. Darn it - never happened when he was at our company! He got new glasses &amp; they were again unfashionably large &amp; unnecessarily heavy. </p><p> </p><p>His assistant, though, Dino.... oh, blond, thin, blue eyes (a quick side glance one day showed soft contacts - never wore glasses to our office, darn it). </p><p> </p><p>Dino gave out lots of gay vibes but nothing direct. My boss kept encouraging me to ask him out for lunch, but I'd had enough of "not out of the closet yet" types &amp; Dino seemed loopy, even if hot. Dino suddenly broke off an engagement. Dino suddenly started smoking Marlboro Light Menthols at the age of about 25 or 26. Maybe if he'd sported those glasses just once... </p><p> </p><p>In junior &amp; senior high the only plus about gym class was the possibility a guy would either leave his glasses near me as I changed to shower (never happened) or that he'd put them on the "shelf" in the gym. Afraid I'd break mine, I always left mine in the changing room. At that time I could just function without them. But I watched like a hawk for guys who'd forgotten to leave their glasses downstairs &amp; went up to the gym with them on. Soon as they realized, they'd put them over the exit door on a small ledge 6' up where the tiled wall protruded from the plaster wall. Maybe twice a year a guy'd forget &amp; go back downstairs without them - I'd be up to the shelf in a second to retrieve those glasses &amp; try them on as I made my way back down stairs to be a temporary hero as I'd casually say "hey, Banic, did you leave these upstairs?" It happened so rarely I can't even recall a decent experience, but I never gave up hope. </p><p> </p><p>There are more tales of the past to share - the forthcoming ones are a bit more complicated to write &amp; I've been caught up in the pre-Christmas busy-ness. Stay tuned &amp; keep your own stories, coming, dudes!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony </b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2002, 16:56</p><p>Back in the early seventies our grade were to be the ones to go swimming once every week. I did not particularly enjoy this but there was one advantage! </p><p> </p><p>My friend nick, who I had known since Kindergarten, also went swimming. He wore geeky black plastic glasses with plus lenses. I would gestimate that they were about + 3 so far as I can remember. </p><p> </p><p>We would all go into the swimming pool but I often came back to "use the john". Then I could open his bag and try them on. I would often find some reading material with small print and see how big I could make it appear by moving the lenses from my face. </p><p> </p><p>One day I flexed the temples. Oh ****. The left temple snaped in half. I started to shake with panick. How could I explain this? I went back into the pool and tried to carry on as normal. At the end of the session I made sure I was first out of the pool. I rushed to the two side by side lockers where Nick and my bags were kept. Luckily there were no actual locks installed on the "lockers". I grabed both Nicks bag and mine. I took them to my changing stall. When Nick came out of the pool I told him I had grabed his bag for him and had slipped on the wet floor and fell on top of his bag. I heard something snap and when I opened his bag his glasses had broken.  </p><p> </p><p>He did not question this and told me not to worry and that he had identical spare glasses at home.We went home on the bus. I asked him what he could see on the bus. He said he could see quite good but could not read signs etc. </p><p> </p><p>The next day he showed up on the bus and we never mentioned it again.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>The OGL</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2002, 11:25</p><p>Oscar: don't think anyone would take offense at a true historical story. Go to Smudge Report and read my essays on the Queens Of Myopia, they're true stories of my coming of age in the glasses business from my pre-teen years (and theirs) and no ones complained. </p><p>Wurm, how about a new thread to accomodate Oscar's story....which of course others and myself can add to?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2002, 10:38</p><p>Mistake in last post. Should read "Phil wanted to keep the window closed".</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;02 Dec 2002, 10:35</p><p>Way back in the early seventies when aviators had not long become the latest fashion in eyewear, a boy, (George) in my year had just gotten a new pair in silver. they were in the minus 4 range so far as I can remember. </p><p> </p><p>The summer vacation approaced and at the age of about twelve going on thirteen we were in a group of mixed age and sex students going to Spain for 10 nights. </p><p> </p><p>When we got to the hotel I was paired up to stay in a room with a boy also in my year named Phil.During the fisrt night or two Phil wanted to sleep with the window open whilst I wanted to keep it open. There were similar problems in another room. George was vey untidy and his rommate Bob did not like this fact. </p><p> </p><p>Phil and Bob suggested that we swop rooms. I got to sleep in the same room as George! We had a kind of joint nightstand. Every night George would leave his glasses on there together with everything else in a heap. During the night I could try them on on and often took them into the bathroom to look in the mirror. </p><p> </p><p>After a day or so I noticed that George had brought out his spare glasses (silver rectangularsingle nose bridge)which were left untidily open on the nightstand.This was very handy.I can remember that his script was contained in the case but this meant nothing to me at the time. After a day or so the maid cleaned the room and must have thought that the spare glasses were mine because she placed them on the subshelf that faced my bed. I did nothing to put them back in thier original place. </p><p> </p><p>One morning I had been trying on Georges regular glasses and they fell down the back of my bed. I did nothing to retrieve them and went out to get breakfast. later on George caught up with me and was annoyed that I had hiden them. I apologised and he was o.k. afterwards. </p><p> </p><p>Happy memories !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2002, 16:55</p><p>I recently went to an automobile show.There were a lot of minus guys there many with up to the date fashions. I saw one guy who had been taking photos of a car who was on his own.He had frameless low minus glasses which were very narrow. He had asian type skin but cocaision type features. I told him that I was sorry to bother him but could he tell me the details of his glasses because I wanted to get some similar to him. He told me he had them whilst of the country cheap but that they were available here. I asked to try them on and he agreed. They were so cool and light. They were about -1.25 the same as mine and I could see very well through them.I had a good look and felt like I would like to keep them on all day. I chatted and gave them back and thanked the guy. He said that I was welcome. </p><p> </p><p>Later I went to a car stand and spoke at length with the guy on the stand. He had frameless plastic reactive glasses with  a residual yellow hue. They were about -3 . I pointed out to the guy that they were the same shape as mine and asked to try them. They were too strong for me but everything looked small and yellow. I then gave them back and he said it was nice to chat to me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Oscar</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2002, 15:07</p><p>OGL I agree about a women's thread. The problem is that the discussion inevitably is going to be at school when - equally inevitably - those girls being discussed are well under the age of 18. There seems to be some discomfort with that (which is completely justified of course). Any ideas how to find a way of talking about this without offending fellow-posters? I remember one girl in my year whose glasses history I tracked very carefully from age 11 to 18 and then - as luck would have it - well beyond. I'll post the details with pleasure, but I don't want to cause offence.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;01 Dec 2002, 14:57</p><p>There was this very handsome Chinese boy in my school called Andy who wore round tortoiseshell specs, quite unusual, with  strongish lenses in them, about -4. I was nuts about him. One day in the school hall a group of us were sitting around and asked Andy if he was short-sighted or long-sighted. "Short-sighted - very", he said, and allowed us to try on his specs. I almost died with excitement at the way the familiar hall became so cramped and blurry. We were about 14. </p><p> </p><p>Andy kept those glasses for the rest of his time at the school, but also acquired a pair of Ray-Ban shaped aviators with pinkish lenses (this was the late 70s!) that really jutted out of the frame. Boy, they were thick. Strangely, he wore them only to read the blackboard. I wasn't in his class, but I remember looking through the window and seeing the delicious moment when he pulled off one pair and put on the other. </p><p> </p><p>The really weird thing is that Andy started playing soccer, and did so bare-eyed! I sneaked into the changing rooms once and tried on *both* his pairs of specs. The aviators seemed a hell of a lot stronger than the old ones; they must have been -6. They were in their case, but the tortoiseshell ones were loose in Andy's pocket and I did something naughty - I smearked fingerprints over them so that when he came back in he had to give them a good long clean, holding them up to his nose to check them. Mmmm. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;30 Nov 2002, 15:30</p><p>Tony, nice job. Good thinking being proactive by having the glasses case in your hand when you ask to borrow it; nice recovery in the night when you dropped the clothing - to no detriment of a night of borrowing. Nice story! </p><p> </p><p>WAY back in time now - to 4th grade. A school vision test advised that I needed glasses; the eye doctor confirmed it. I begged for wire rims but my parents wouldn't fork over the extra $10, insisting that since they were just for part time use it would be a waste of money. Probably -.5 each lens. Small non-descript brown plastic frames ... while the few other glasses wearers in class all had wire frames, so any incentive to wear them for anything but films &amp; blackboard reading was gone. </p><p> </p><p>2 years later I was retested &amp; new glasses were ordered. They'd be full time (it was told to me), probably -1 each. I got to order wire frames this time, but again I had no say in the style &amp; ended up with plain non-desript-shaped wired rims while other glasses wearers had variations on aviators. Back then there was a couple of week wait between ordering them &amp; getting them.  </p><p> </p><p>A friend Kerry had been wearing glasses longer than me &amp; he was a grade younger than me. He'd started with part time rectangular tortoise shell glasses he actually wore alot. Then to larger (not oversize) wire frames with frames shaped like a tv set. I liked those. Those he had when this adventure took place. </p><p> </p><p>We occastionally got to play at each others houses after school - since few videos games existed so it was tv or records. Alone with him at his house, I told him I was getting glasses full time in a couple of weeks, wire rims, though not aviators. I'd brought (but of course had not worn) my glasses to his house to show him my soon-to-be-replaced glasses. He wasn't impressed. I told him when I was wearing them they seemed "all frame" - when he wore glasses all the time did he no longer notice that? Was it less noticable with wire frames? </p><p> </p><p>He told me he didn't even notice glasses anymore &amp; let me try his on. In retrospect I can see that my eyes at -1 were much different than at -.5. No wonder my first pair didn't make much of a difference any more. His glasses (at probably -1 or -1.25) made a HUGE difference. I was so amazed &amp; had long forgotten the difference that those first glasses had made at first. </p><p> </p><p>I made such a fuss over looking at everything that he said I could wear them as long as I wanted to that afternoon. I never took them off. I offered him my old ones but as he didn't like them (&amp; they were so weak anyway) he declined. He didn't get his old ones out to wear - I don't know if he still had them or not. </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly I was looking forward to getting glasses full time - it was so cool to everything be so incredibly sharp. When the glasses finally arrived I was disappointed by the frames but liked what I could see. I'd have been content to be able to "swap" glasses with Kerry when we got together just for a fun change (thinking our eyes were at about the same prescription) but the opportunity didn't present itself. </p><p> </p><p>Kerry soon had a surprise - not only did he get new (stronger) glasses, aviators of course, but he got contacts, too, which he adapted to quite easily. I did not have the opportunity to try on his new glasses &amp; see how much worse his eyes were than mine. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tony</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2002, 18:00</p><p>Going back to the early nineties when huge glasses were very cool I went with a small bus full of boys to a football weekend camp, I didn't play football myself but was invited along. </p><p> </p><p>The driver of the bus had huge blue glasses. The left lens was about -2.5 to -3 and the right lens was about + 4 with  a huge ammount of astigmatism. John the driver had taken  an empty case with him to place the glasses in when he was in bed.  </p><p> </p><p>During the bus trip I sat next to him and with the case in my hand asked if I could use it as my glasses were rolling along the dashboard of the bus. He agreed and I did not give it back to him for the whole weekend. We arrived and it was dark. We all went out for a few beers. </p><p> </p><p>When we came back John and I got into  a dorm of four people with our beds next to each other. We shared a nightstand between us. I did in fact have one on my side but i conveniently removed it beforehand. I got undressed and put my glassds on the nightsgand. John got undressed and into bed and put his glasses into his pants pocket and hung them on a nail in between us on the wall. </p><p> </p><p>During the course of the night. I put a foot out of bed and grabed the pants with one hand. CRASH - The pants fell to the floor with  a bump. John woke up! I said I must have bumped into the pants by mistake. I figured he did not believe me but he said nothing. </p><p> </p><p>He removed his glasses out of his pocket and placed them on the nightstand! I said they would be safer there. </p><p> </p><p>John then went to sleep and I tried them on all night. When the early morning light appeared I could look accross the room and see strange shapes. I placed them back on the nightstand not long before John awoke.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;29 Nov 2002, 12:33</p><p>Thanks for your patience - it's easier to write weekends. When I get low on memories I'll go into my own boring lens history. </p><p> </p><p>Back up the time machine to the early 90s. I chaperoned a group of 15 or so students from the local university to an "urban immersion" experience for a week during their break. I wasn't that long out of college so I was more like a peer than a chaperone. A couple of glasses moments stand out. </p><p> </p><p>Mike had a great body - dark haired preppy guy with a tennis player's body. But quite silly &amp; down to earth. He'd not worn glasses to our preliminary meetings but he showed up at the van wearing glasses. Probably more comfortable to wear glasses if dozing off &amp; on for the 12 hour drive. Dark brown glasses popular around 90 ... but how would I describe them? Metal/vinyl thinner frames, either dark brown or black (when worn by men), slightly larger &amp; somewhat more squared off than horn rim shaped, though somewhat reminiscent. One single connector over the nose. Mine at the time were nearly identical but a cheaper model. The arms of his glasses even flanged out slightly at the hinge. </p><p> </p><p>The first night those of us not tired from the drive lounged around the pit area in this church basement-turned alleged conference center. I'd taken out my contacts but had declined to put on my glasses for some reason. It was kind of dim &amp; hard to see anyway, I think. Mike looked so hot anyway &amp; I wanted to try on his glasses. I was next to him anyway so after a while I said: "I took my contacts out - can I borrow your glasses to find my way to wherever the bathroom is?" He didn't mind at all. I took them from him &amp; as I slipped them on I could tell they were well made. They were a little weaker than my prescription. The bathroom was empty, happily, so I could look at myself in them &amp; see how they made things look to my heart's content. I returned them to him &amp; he newer guessed how I'd lusted over him with them. </p><p> </p><p>One night we took the train to the theater. One of the females on this trip looked (in retrospect) like a young Sanda Bullock; she wore large dark plastic frame glasses. Bill (who looked like a younger Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20 with shorter, thicker hair), unbeknownst to me up to that point, had glasses which he carried along to view the play with. To sit on the subway seat he took the case out of his pants &amp; held it. The Sandra Bullock lookalike struck up a conversation with Bill about glasses. Since it wasn't male-to-male glasses conversation I only paid marginal attention. She explained that she had perfect vision but had always wanted glasses &amp; wanted to look more serious, so she'd fibbed in the vision text &amp; it worked - she had very low minus glasses. It seems like she said she could wear them for quite awhile before her eyes or head began to ache. She &amp; Bill swapped glasses (neither flatted the other, of course, as neither had unisex glasses) &amp; Bill did put his on briefly after they'd swapped. He had gold rimless wire frames (the light gold not the very yellow gold), large mostly rectangular lenses - 2 connectors across as the nose bridge, the top one straight across the top. He looked very nice in them. </p><p> </p><p>Dan (who had kind of a wrestler's build &amp; look about him) was seated next to him &amp; said "My roommate's got the coolest glasses." He ended abruptly &amp; I got the sense the whole subject was about the be dropped. I quickly offered: "Now what do you look like in Bill's glasses" to Dan &amp; as Bill was putting his glasses back into the case he handed them to Dan who put them on &amp; off so quickly I didn't get a decent look. It didn't appear that I missed much anyway. That was that. During the play Bill wore his low minus glasses, but they came off &amp; went into the case in the pants pocket the moment intermission started &amp; back to the pants pocket at the show's end, too. (Gives us a new phrase: "Hey, is that a glasses case in your pants pocket or are you just happy to see me?") </p><p> </p><p>Bill's "bag" (vs. suitcase) was next mine as he had the upper bunk in our compound. When all the students were away I sneaked his glasses out of there to inspect them. Very light prescription. I could have worn them all day given the chance (I didn't take the chance &amp; replaced them minutes later). They did have a chip on the front edge, lower part of the lens. Probably an accident related to a time they were NOT being worn.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;24 Nov 2002, 15:29</p><p>"Rick, part 2" </p><p> </p><p>Rick got a job in another city &amp; moved away before he could see the light about me. (HA!) He made several moves but kept in touch. One day on the subway I saw a guy who looked like he could be Rick's twin. I knew it couldn't be Rick, geographically, &amp; had it been him he'd have recognized me. This guy had gold roundish/oval glasses with a straight connector over the nose instead of the usual curve. A hipper style. The real Rick would have benefited from that exact style. </p><p> </p><p>A couple of years later a business seminar took me to the city where Rick was taking classes - we set up so that at the end of the seminar I'd meet him after class, then he'd take me back to Dayton where he lived; I'd stay Saturday night &amp; return to my home Sunday. </p><p> </p><p>I met Vic at a restaurant &amp; he was wearing his glasses. (Hmmm... I wondered, did he give up on contacts?) He looked better than ever &amp; had on glasses very similar to the guy on the subway train! Over dinner I complimented him on his glasses &amp; he said he was saving his contacts for that night we we'd hit a bar or two. We got all caught up &amp; it was fun barring with him again these years later. He was driving so I celebrated plenty with the beer. </p><p> </p><p>He set me up in his bedroom &amp; he bunked in the living room. My glasses weren't as cool as his so in the morning I went out bareeyed - more like redeyed - to the living room where he was reading the paper. IN HIS ROBE. I thought about getting my glasses but didn't. I squinted at the comics; he read his horoscope &amp; said: "You are never going to believe my horoscope: Instead of going to church you will socialize with a former neighbor." </p><p> </p><p>I told him I didn't believe it &amp; he gave it to me to read. Such small print horoscopes... I had to hold it about 4" from my face I think. "Go get your glasses" he said. </p><p> </p><p>I TOLD A BIG FAT LIE: "I didn't think to bring them on the trip. I ALWAYS wear my contacts." He took off his glasses &amp; handed them to me "here you go, Mr. Blind." </p><p> </p><p>EYE OPPORTUNITY GRANTED. I put them on: "MUCH better, Rick. I can see almost fine!" Since we'd been neighbors my eye sight had leveled off; his had worsened. One eye was a little weak &amp; the other a little strong but not too badly. I could read the horoscope just fine &amp; then insisted on reading the rest of them (while I mostly peeked over at Rick - and he couldn't see me peeking). </p><p> </p><p>I finished &amp; (reluctantly) gave his glasses back to him. He said to get dressed &amp; he'd take me out to breakfast. "Man, my eyes aren't ready for conacts yet" I objected. Rick looked at my eyes &amp; saw how red they are. He took off his glasses again &amp; handed them back to me; I put them back on. "Can you see well enough to eat in these? I'll wear my contacts. </p><p> </p><p>He got ready; I got ready. I liked how they looked on my as I devoured the bathroom mirror. I came back out in the living room: "Man, I really like these." He admitted they suited me well &amp; we were off. </p><p> </p><p>A very cool experience wearing his glasses for so long. Shame he didn't just say: "They suit you so well you just keep them; I need to get new ones anyway." Shame breakfast can only last so long. I wondered what he was thinking, this dude's using my glasses...  After breakfast I put in my contacts &amp; headed home. Set adrift on memory bliss. </p><p> </p><p>Few experiences could match that. Perhaps on a future story that ends in "missed opportunity" I'll add a fictional How Things Could Have Ended tag.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2002, 19:26</p><p>Operation coworker's glasses: </p><p> </p><p>Mike the temp was brought into our department. Cute, fresh out of college. Not used to doing so much computer work, reading &amp; other sight related stuff. So he started bringing his glasses to work &amp; wearing them most of the time. This was a few years ago, they were large silver rimless models with a very low prescription.  </p><p> </p><p>Each day he wore them Eyescene's own Julian (had he been there) would have been silently thanking Mike for gracing us with his glasses even though he could have gotten by without them. Since Julian wasn't there I was thinking it! </p><p> </p><p>Mike had the cubicle to my left so we could pass things back &amp; forth without using the hallways. We could also spy, er, look at each other &amp; make faces. If I poked my head over the cubicle wall his cologne would even waft up to me. I was SURE he was wearing gay cologne, too. He wasn't at the company long enough for me to seduce him. Smooth operator that I am, given a few decades I might have been able to win him over. After all, the female naive accounts payable clerk did once note at how we were becoming "fast friends." Just because we sat with each other at each lunch away from everyone else? </p><p> </p><p>From my cubicle I could also see if he wearing his glasses or if they were sitting up on his bookshelf. </p><p> </p><p>I generally got to our department first &amp; when I got to my cubicle one Monday morning there were Mike's glasses on his book shelf. First action: TRY THEM ON! &amp; GO LOOK AT YOURSELF! That I did. Dreamy glasses - just enough prescription for my eyes to feel that I was indeed wearing some guy's glasses. The frames were just a little big for me for my fancy. Clearly, Mike's head, being just out of college, was still stuffed full of knowledge &amp; thus wider than mine, but for those years no one would notice. </p><p> </p><p>Then it struck me: had I noticed them Friday afternoon I could have enjoyed them the whole weekend. SHOOT! SPECS OPPORTUNITY LOST. Oh well, there was always the possibility he'd leave them again. As a temp, he didn't have access to the building after 5:30 so if he came back for them he couldn't get it to get them. </p><p> </p><p>I counted the hours down 'til the end of the day. What do you know, he left work &amp; the glasses remained on the shelf again. WHOOSH &amp; they were in my pocket &amp; at least I had one evening of enjoying them before returning them to.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;23 Nov 2002, 19:09</p><p>Thanks guys for the encouraging words. It was reading your stories, Tony, that helped me find my writing voice. I'm eager to hear what other Borrowing stories others add to this thread. </p><p> </p><p>Another trip back in time: My HOT-HOT-HOT next door neighbor (who thank goodness was gay but unfortunately not interested in me) saved me from a night of processing inventory tickets I'd brought home by inviting me over to bake Christmas cookies. Like any decent gay guy right out of college I already had an extensive collection of cookie cutters. </p><p> </p><p>I'd chosen that night to enzyme my contacts &amp; rather than wear my gold aviators which were by that time literally falling apart I went bare eyed. "Jesus, you've got a lot of Santa's" said my neighbor, Rick, as he sorted through the cookie cutters. (I suppose that at that same moment some elf at the North Pole was looking over a big ol' pile of creches about to go into St. Nick's bag &amp; saying: "Santa, you've got a lot of Jesuses.") </p><p> </p><p>When Rick was younger he'd suffered a minor eye injury &amp; as a result, in his mid-20s, he couldn't wear his contacts TOO long at a time so I often got to see him in his glasses &amp; even when "contacted" his glasses weren't far. But I'd never gotten to try them. They were dark plastic, rounded &amp; with two connectors - one to sit on the nose &amp; one to run straight across the top. </p><p> </p><p>I started to get a little headache so I asked Rick if I could borrow his glasses. Oh, sure, no big thing (NOT TO HIM!). I went &amp; got them &amp; wore them the rest of the cookie baking time. Like me, his contact prescription was more up to date than his glasses &amp; he'd always be squinting a bit with our glasses on. His were weaker than mine but helped somewhat. If I couldn't be wearing his shirt at least I could be wearing his glasses. Both lenses were about the same strength (about -2 I'd guess) so with my eyes being kind of far off I had a good eye &amp; a poor eye. </p><p> </p><p>We used about half the dough cutting a bunch of Santas, bells &amp; some states (did I mention for a time I collected cookie cutters in the shapes of states? Once I'd given various cookies to my pal Anne who offered one to her husband Bob. He took one, gulped it down in one bite &amp; she said: "You just ate Connecticut!"). </p><p> </p><p>For some fun (&amp; in my mind a BIG HINT) I took a knife &amp; outlined the shape of a man's "member" in the dough. I lifted it off the board &amp; put it in the pad. Rick got a big kick out of it &amp; said: "You sure are familiar with the shape!" He made one, making sure it was a lot longer than mine. But it was also thinner so it burned. We used up the rest of the dough on Members... then joked about where the frosting would go. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2002, 20:25</p><p>Back in college I had a glasses borrowing/practical joke experience from dorm life. Our dining service cards had photos on them; as we entered the cafeteria we'd pick up our card, then return it to cashier upon getting our food. Our names and photos were on the cards so no one could slip through using someone else's card. If your card was damaged campus sent you a card to take to have a new photo taken &amp; thus a new card made. You had a photoless temp card you had to show some other ID to use each time. </p><p> </p><p>One day walking along I saw that familiar New Card form someone had dropped. It was a guy's &amp; I got a good idea. Down the hall from my room, my cousin's roommate mostly wore contacts but occasionally wore his glasses. Early '80s, so they had big dark plastic frames with a tint. Got me planning. Upon showing the New Card/photo request form to my crafty cousin we cooked up our plan. We figured if I went in quickly enouth &amp; had my photo taken it would appear on this guy's dining service card before he could resubmit another New Card request. </p><p> </p><p>All I had to do was memorize this mystery guy's name &amp; SSN. I thought it would be fun if I looked as dorky as possible, my cousin agreed. I wore an awful bowling shirt, rubbed ice tea mix into my skin to give myself a slight yellow glow, gooed my hair spikey &amp; casually said to my cousin: "how 'bout if borrow Stu's glasses to hide my eyes?" </p><p> </p><p>I'd always wanted to try them on. They were really big on my face but they'd be the icing on the cake for the picture. So for part of a day I had Stu's glasses all to myself! They weren't quite as strong as mine but I could function. They were so big they'd have drawn attention among my pals (&amp; I didn't want to wear tea on my face, etc. all day) so I went, had myself photographed &amp; enjoyed his glasses the rest of the day, returning them later. </p><p> </p><p>A year or two later in roll call in a class a name jarred my memory. Could it be? Yes, it was the guy who'd lost his card. After class I asked him if he'd ever lost his dining service card &amp; he said yeah &amp; there was a big fuss when someone else's picture suddenly appeared on his card - they refused to serve him! He just laughed - it had been easily corrected &amp; was just so weird ... and such a ridiculous face was on it! (Harrumph!) </p><p> </p><p>I didn't identify myself or explain on how many levels I'd enjoyed the experience.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>MinusDude</b>&nbsp;22 Nov 2002, 05:02</p><p>Back to high school. We had a pep rally during school - an excuse to get out of geometry. There were 2 other guys in the class who wore glasses, Mark &amp; Greg. Greg would get a new pair of glasses each year, progressively nicer &amp; a little stronger each time. After a succesion of various wire frame aviators he had a rectangular grey frame. He was nice to look at; not a jock type but I'd say the nicest smile in school. </p><p> </p><p>Mark was average looking &amp; when he'd gone from rectangular silver wire frames to larger black plastic front frames with silver metal arms (made his head look small) he'd also gotten contacts. Like me, hard contacts, which he didn't adapt to well. So both of us went bare-eyed alot, carrying around the glasses we weren't too fond of &amp; squinting alot. </p><p> </p><p>Mark sat between the window &amp; me; one day when it suddenly started to snow everyone started watching it. Mark had to put on his glasses before he could appreciate it; I asked to borrow his to see it; it was a nice snow. His glasses were nearly the same prescription as mine, just a tad shy in the right eye. </p><p> </p><p>So anyway that other day we filed down for the pep rally. In the gym we were ushered to the balcony, far away from the cheerleaders. Mark bemoaned that he'd left his glasses back in the classroom so Greg took his off &amp; lent them to Mark. HOT! Greg's glasses looked SO much better on Mark that Mark's. Mark wore them for a while; I didn't want to miss out so I bemoaned the fact that my glasses were back in the classroom &amp; I couldn't see the cheerleaders (HA!). Mark passed the glasses to me. Greg's glasses were a little weaker than mine but I really liked them. We continued to pass them back &amp; forth the duration of the cheerleader section. I was never so glad we had cheerleaders!</p><p></p><hr>
