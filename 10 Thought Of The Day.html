<p><b>hooked</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2013, 13:51</p><p>Long time ago since I have posted. </p><p> </p><p>Some days ago my wife and me talked about glasses. I can't remember why but surely this is a topic I prefer discussing. Probably it was because our younger daughter got stronger glasses ( +2.5 instead of +1.5). I made a small comment like that I don't think it is too dramatic a change. </p><p> </p><p>Then she said to me: </p><p>"I know you prefer glasses which make eyes bigger like mine." </p><p> </p><p>I was quite shocked. I never told her anything about my attraction to that but she was absolute true.  </p><p> </p><p>Can women really do thought-reading? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Crystal Veil</b>&nbsp;30 Dec 2012, 03:31</p><p>Soundmanpt, </p><p> </p><p>the nurse saw me selecting the glasses just before the photo shoot with Lucy. She was very curious and as my brother was fast asleep we went through the Zennis and picked out her favorite pair (which can be seen in the final pictures of Lucy). The frame was only available in brown but she did not mind. Weeks later she sent me her full prescription (about -3) and I ordered the glasses. They arrived just in time for Christmas. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;22 Dec 2012, 07:18</p><p>I recall telling a 'blonde' joke (personally I LOVE blonde GWGs:- blonde = fun, and glasses = brains so blonde GWG is the perfect package :))to a blonde woman who was a friend. After I got to the end of this glaringly obvious joke, she looked at me in puzzlement, and - without any humour or irony or anything - said.................. 'I don't get it.........'.

He only has one ear!"* </p><p>  </p><p>*The detective put his head in his hands and exclaimed,* </p><p>  </p><p>*"Didn't you hear what I just told the other lady?* </p><p>*This is a profile of the man's face! Of course you can only see one </p><p>ear! * </p><p>*You're excused too!"* </p><p>  </p><p>*The second blonde sheepishly walked out of the office.* </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>*The detective turned his attention to the third and last blonde and </p><p>  </p><p>said,* </p><p>*"This is probably a waste of time, but...." * </p><p>*He flashed the photo in her face for a couple of seconds and withdrew </p><p>it, saying,* </p><p>*"All right, did you notice anything distinguishing or unusual about this </p><p>man?"* </p><p>  </p><p>*The blonde said,* *"I sure did. This man wears contact lenses.* </p><p>  </p><p>*" The detective frowned, took another look at the picture, and began </p><p>  </p><p>looking at some of the papers in the folder.* </p><p>  </p><p>*He looked up at the blonde with a puzzled expression and said,* </p><p>*"You're absolutely right! His bio says he wears contacts! How in the </p><p>world could you tell that by looking at his picture?"* </p><p>  </p><p>*The blonde rolled her eyes and said,* *"Well, Hellooooooooooooo!* </p><p>*With only one eye and one ear, ...he certainly can't wear glasses."* </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>hooked</b>&nbsp;11 Jul 2012, 04:49</p><p>My thought of the day: </p><p> </p><p>I didn't make much mistakes my life. </p><p> </p><p>One of my biggest ones was when my wife (girl-friend at those times) told me she wants to try contacts and I didn't say a word. I just said it after she ordered some. And she said: "Couldn't you have said it before? Now I will try them." </p><p>It's not teh case that she never had glasses on afterwards.  </p><p>Mostly she had them on while at home but not in public area. </p><p>I would have so much liked to marry a bride with glasses. </p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile (more than 20 years later) she's completely back into glasses with some exceptions like swimming (which I can completely understand). </p><p> </p><p>Yes, I'm kind of crazy.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;18 Jun 2009, 10:50</p><p>I was pondering my "geek/nerd fetish" the other day and had a stunning realization-WE'RE ALL GEEKS! By "we" I mean us OOs. According to Wikipedia (which I'll grant isn't necessarily the best information source on all subjects, especially considering what they say about glasses fetish) one definition of a geek is: </p><p> </p><p>A person with a devotion to something in a way that places him or her outside the mainstream. This could be due to the intensity, depth, or subject of their interest. This definition is very broad but because many of these interests have mainstream endorsement and acceptance, the inclusion of some genres as "geeky" is heavily debated. </p><p> </p><p>I daresay our devotion to glasses places us outside the mainstream. But I don't really mind being outside the mainstream, now that I know I'm not the only fish in this particular "sidestream". 8-) </p><p> </p><p>I ALWAYS make passes at guys who wear glasses, Marie </p><p>P.S. Speaking of Wikipedia's glasses fetish "article", what do you all think about me maybe sending my text about it that's at Bobby's site into Wikipedia?  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;17 May 2009, 23:00</p><p>The use of webcams is an interesting way to spot people wearing their glasses. First occasion last week was someone I've known for a few years but never seen them with glasses till I caught him on the webcam. He kept them on for a bit, they were plus lenses, then took them off. Second occasion was a slightly nearsighted friend obviously now a fulltime wearer.

If you try really hard and lobby and promote your ideas, the next president might be a blue eyed, blond haired, 100% caucassian, biblical fundamentalist, creationist, pentecostal halleluya-er who will ban abortion, immigration of arabs, teaching Darwin's theory at schools and allow children to carry weapons since the age of 10.

The certificate that is being circulated by Obama's camp is not a birth certificate, but what is known as a COLB ( CERTIFICATE OF LIVE BIRTH ) which can be obtained by showing ANY birth certificate from any country. It does not contain a hospital, doctors signitature, or raised seal, and can not be used to prove citizenship.  </p><p>  If Obama was born in Kenya, he is not a citizen ,as the law states that if only one parent is a U.S. citizen , and that would be his mother, that she must have resided in the U.S. continously for five years after age nineteen , which she did not. </p><p>  There is a second issue, in that it appears that Obama also has Indonesian citizenship, and a president can not have dual citizenship.</p><p></p><hr>

They referred to an incidence of 20% of side effects, mainly glare at night. For this reason, both pilots and train drivers in Germany are not allowed to have lasik. Also, they showed a case of a young lady who has lasik, but was allergic, and should never have been allowed to take the treatment. After initial good results, she now has only 20% vision, and this is apparently irreversible. A professor warned that lasik is a major operation, and should not be undertaken lightly. </p><p>Of course, just the kind of news report an OO likes to see, hopefully the GWGs were watching too.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Bobby</b>&nbsp;07 Nov 2008, 03:53</p><p>Black or white (or yellow or pink or whatever color you may think of), Obama is a university graduate American. He thinks and feels like an American not like an African, (or a European, or a half-breed, or name-it-we-have-it). And politics has always been The Art Of The Possible. He can implement only those changes in the life (policy, economy, ...) of your country that your country and the people of your country can, want, and are able to undergo. Whether you like him or not, he is only a president. He does not rule the country by himself. There is the Congres, there are ministers, advisors, and millions of ordinary people. So anything that is going to happen will happen only if it is politically, economically and socially feasible. Those who exult of joy too much are wrong, only a part of what they hope for will happen. And those who lament are wrong as well, as only a small part of what they are afraid of will happen. The inertia of the development of society is very powerful. Stop dancing inthe streets and stop wearing black clothes. Those were only elections of 2008. The Earth keeps spinning. ...  </p><p>And girls with glasses are as hot as they were last year.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ehpc</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2008, 18:28</p><p>Jennifer's wrong though. She doesn't deal in facts. It is a fact (not my opnion) that Obama is as white as he is black. The'racism' belongs to people who think 'non-white'equals 'black'.That's plain ignorance, and a real 'WASP' bit of patronisation. No-one can accuse me of racism.

One eighth of black blood made you a black person, therefore a slave, unless your master freed you from bondage.  Pete, it's your opinion that Barack Obama is more white than black.  Before the Civil Rights accomplishments of America, he would have been subject to all discrimination any other black person faced.  It didn't matter that his mother was white.  And to show how much America has matured, on the year, his parents were married (1961) it was illegal for a black and a white to marry in 12 states of this union.  I would suggest doing a little research of American history before speaking.  Therefore, I am very proud of what happend on November 4th in America.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Dieter</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2008, 10:55</p><p>Pete, you really seem hell-bent on discussing politics on a vision forum.  Since you opened the floor, I have to say that your conservative and bigoted colors are showing brightly.  As recently as the 1970s, some of the southern states of the US still classified people as negro&#65533; if they possessed as little as 1/10th black heritage.  Its not as if those people were given the decision to identify with the race of their choice.  It was done for them by their government. </p><p> </p><p>As an American, one thing I have never been proud about is the fact that our beloved founding fathers faltered in their principles in order to create the union of all.  What I mean by that is that all men are created equal&#65533; was meant strictly for white European men.  Native Americans were disposed of and eventually forced to move by death marches&#65533; to Indian Territory in the west, blacks were allowed to be owned as property in order to benefit the economies of southern states, and women were not given the right to vote until the 20th century. </p><p> </p><p>Lynching of uppity&#65533; blacks was still common as late as the 1950s.  People were beaten and killed in the 1960s for doing as little as trying to assist black people in registering to vote.  Many of us remember watching the news stories on TV in horror.  Others have suffered those experiences first hand in their lifetimes.  Excuse our excitement for celebrating a day in America where everyone can at least dream of hope and change. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>SZ6</b>&nbsp;06 Nov 2008, 08:57</p><p>Race is purely a social construct. It is based on self-identity and how that identity is viewed by the population as a whole.

It will put the first-time customers at their ease. I agree wholeheartedly with your comments in the second paragraph.  </p><p> </p><p>I notice in the UK many of the girls who work in the high street opticians wear very stylish frames at work. Do you think they might choose the job applicant needing correction rather than a 20-20 girl ?  </p><p> </p><p>Alternatively, do any of the girls do GOC. I suspect it would be frowned on by the over-regulated optical profession here. Might be a fun prospect though, if the girl was already an GOCer at the time of her appointment ! Would she admit it, or wait till her employer found out, by which time, she probably was recognised as the best sales girl in the shop.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;17 Sep 2007, 01:38</p><p>I'm not sure that I believe that not wearing minus correction hastens myopia. In my view it's quite the contrary. When one takes one's specs off one feels helpless for a bit. But then one adjusts. I fear that wearing fulltime would make that adjustment harder. And eventually one would succumb. I'd hate to feel I could not survive without glasses. </p><p>Now that I'm -4 I certainly feel pretty blind when I take my glasses off. But if I haven't been wearing them for a while I can cope in most situations. I think that there is a difference between how I was when I was -3 and how I am now. I suspect that few people of -4 cope without their glaases but that it is much more common among those with -3 rx. </p><p>I already suspect that I could do with a small increase and that may well prove the straw that breaks the camel's back!

<p><b>jesse</b>&nbsp;15 Sep 2007, 05:23</p><p>Phil, just out of interest, do you find it different to go without glasses with -4 than with -3? If you just can remember.

Probably not very early with your ability to cope.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Guest</b>&nbsp;14 Sep 2007, 12:03</p><p>I don't know if this is true but I heard that going without correction makes myopia progress more. Maybe that's why Phil. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2007, 13:53</p><p>Phil - who knows if you'll be right! I've recorded here my small increases in the last few years but seem to have settled. At my last exam, the optician said that he didn't need to see me again for 2 years, although of course I'll have to have the annual contacts check-up. At the moment I'm not too worried.  Like most people I use a PC at work, and for a limited amount of time at home, so nothing excessive like they claim is making children more likely to develop myopia.  On the progressives, someone at work has being doing mono vision for some years and reports very good vision. Hopefully that'll be me too, otherwise I'll just be taking my specs off to read - funny, now I remember that years ago that's what an optician told me I'd be doing! Of course I didn't know much about all this optical stuff then so it made no sense at all.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2007, 01:04</p><p>There's nothing "puny" about you Clare! An intelligent City girl with a perfect rx and lenses and (by the sound of it) a pretty exquisite taste in frames just can't be that! </p><p>When I was your age I hovered around -3. Over the last 10 or so years I've crept up, an extra .25 here and there. I wouldn't be surprised to see you do the same. Do you spend much time at the computer? Just like reading books at Oxford sent me shooting up from a tiny minus rx when I left school to over -2 3 years later, so I suspect that ever-increasing reliance on computers has caused my rx to pick up again after a fairly stable period in my 20s and early 30s. </p><p>I suspect that with the passage of time we'll both end up as fulltime wearers of progressives. What are you thinking of doing when presbyopia sets in? I've tried lined bifocals and weaker "reading" specs, and going bare-eyed, but the only real course (for me, at least) is progressives if I'm honest.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;12 Sep 2007, 01:21</p><p>Hi Clare, Crazy Phil here! If I'm mad it's only your acceptance of contacts that saves you being just as bonkers. In fact I suspect that I emerge with glasses rather more than you do. The truth is that we both have this "thing" about being seen in specs. I think we are quite unusual, even in the OO world. Odd thing is that, if I saw you in specs, I'd think you looked marvellous in them. So why can't you wear them without a worry? I'm not sure whether you'd think my glasses ameliorated my many defects! But when we eventually have that coffee we'll find out. Hope you had a good summer too. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;11 Sep 2007, 13:21</p><p>Spectator - don't get me wrong, I didn't mean I never wear glasses when I'm without contacts, I just don't automatically replace one with another.

<p><b>Phil</b>&nbsp;07 Sep 2007, 04:41</p><p>Hi Clare. </p><p>Haven't heard from you for ages. I've been away-first New York and then the Med-and wearing virtually fulltime. But now that I'm back at work I've lapsed into my bad old ways: I'm going bare-eyed at the computer and generally in the Office. So it really is an "embarrassment" thing, which seems worst with colleagues. Family, friends, neighbours etc have seen me in specs (if not fulltime) but they've really hardly ever been worn at work. So if you think you are "shy" you are nothing like as bad as me! I don't even wear contacts and have more than a dioptre more minus than you! </p><p>Are you due a test?

<p><b>cut-in UK </b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2007, 13:53</p><p>E-S Visitor, you don't need a psychiatrist to analyse a simple fetish. I believe that  you should tell your wife that you simply think that glasses enhance an already attractive woman.You can compare this to a nice pair of ear-rings or a pair of shoes. What you MUSTN'T do is to suggest that it is the main or sole reason for attraction. That is the essence of a fetish, and as the fetishist is predominantly (but by no means exclusively) male, this has to remain your little secret. If your wife is not the sort to be turned on by a fetishistic attribute, you will get no benefit from admitting that you are. She will probably respond if you compliment her regularly in a general way, but make sure that the glasses are seen as a special feature; (the icing on the cake!) </p><p> </p><p>Subtlety is the keynote here as she is aware of your leaning. Build on it slowly as an important feature in her arsenal of attractive features. </p><p> </p><p>Let us know how you get on but remember that women are very intuitive and don't overdo it.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>hooked</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2007, 03:46</p><p>I never told my wife that I want to see her rather in glasses than without. </p><p> </p><p>Sometimes she askes me if she should wear glasses or put in contacts. </p><p> </p><p>Naturally, I answer she should wear glasses. </p><p>Sometimes I got a strange look then but not all the time. </p><p> </p><p>I don't know how my wife would react. </p><p> </p><p>Once I thought she had found out: </p><p> </p><p>We've been walking in the evening on the crowdiest street of the city and a young couple came across and I couldnÄt do nothing as staring on the nice looking girl with her glasses at least half a minute. </p><p>She asked me.

<p><b>Aubrac</b>&nbsp;04 Sep 2007, 00:29</p><p>ES-Visitor </p><p> </p><p>It's a difficult one because most women are just not turned on by popular male fetishes. It is difficult for a women to understand how a man can be attracted by shoes, feet, amputees, glasses, etc, which are all very real for a lot of us. </p><p> </p><p>I suppose only about 10%/15% of women have some sort of fetish as they usually tend to be attracted by the whole male 'look' rather than one body part or object. </p><p> </p><p>After a few too many glasses of vino I told my wife how fantastic she looked and I felt when she wore her glasses. I got a sort of uncomprehending response. It did tend to have the reverse effect and sometimes when she is at the computer wearing glasses, she will take them off when I come into the room. However, when I asked she did wear her glasses all evening when we went out to dinner last week. Although we've been married five years, my knees did shake a little under the table when she gazed intently at me with her slightly magnified (+1.75)lovely grey blue eyes with their tiny streaks of amber. </p><p> </p><p>My only advice for anyone is to tell their partner but always start the conversation by saying how sexy we find them as a person, how sexy they look doing certain things, how sexy they look wearing certain clothes/shoes and only then, how sexy they look wearing their glasses.  </p><p> </p><p>I hope you girls out there don't find this patronising as it certainly isn't meant to be and I would love to hear your comments.

After I did promise to quit looking for this matter on the web, she got me back at it again, it's now hell because of that. Actually, she doesn't wear glasses, in fact she does have a pair for a very mild prescrption but she uses them very rarely. She thinks that I'd be attracted to a woman only because she wears glasses or she's a high myope. She can't understand that this is not a precontditio9n for being attracted but just a plus, a strong stimulus... I'm sure many of you people are facing more or less same issues. I've been suggested to seek advice with a psychiatrist as it's a kind of addiction!! What do you my friends think??</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LD</b>&nbsp;11 Aug 2006, 06:10</p><p>I've thought about this too and would be interested to know how it came about that what we consider "normal" vision is agreed as being 20/20.  Personally I think it would be more accurate to have a range of normal vision, say -0.75 to +0.75 maybe.  My old glasses eave me with a rx of -.50 in both eyes but honestly it's a very fine difference and one with which I'd cope very happily with glasses if it was my "bare eyed" rx.  I've no problem with people wearing glasses for this kind of rx (the more the merrier) but I find it pretty annoying when these people claim to "blind" without their glasses.  I mean I am -6.50 and although I think my uncorrected vision is fairly bad, I would never say I was "blind".   People may say this light heartedly but even so is it not kind of offensive to the genuinely blind? </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;09 Aug 2006, 18:43</p><p>That sounds like a story idea I had once: imagine that there is a long-lost island or nation which for some reason has a different definition of what "normal" or "perfect" eyesight is. What we call 20/20 vision is to an extent arbitary. Yes, it's related to what might be considered useful, even vital.  </p><p> </p><p>I thought that maybe the inhabitants of this odd country might consider 20/100 to be normal vision. Then someone comes from the outside world and introduces them to our interpretation of "normal vision". </p><p> </p><p>Sorry, never have half the time I want to write stories. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;13 Sep 2005, 12:00</p><p>I think the full impact of this tragedy hasn't hit us yet.  The number of people affected is vague.  The number of dead isn't coming out clearly.  We keep hearing about "dead bodies" floating in the water.  Yet, the number of dead estimates has been pushed down.  I get the feeling our media is trying to sanitize this whole tradegy.  Could it be that because 9-11 was caused by an "enemy" the media was quicker to give results.  Katrina is a natural disaster and therefore no one to directly blame.  Unless you want to blame the local, state, federal government for lack of response.  The Katrina huricane is far worse than what happened on 9-11.  A greater number of people and territory have been affected.  My thoughts and prayers are with the people of the gulf coast.</p><p></p><hr>

I'm hopeful the current administration will fall on it's own knife and end up on the sidelines the way Gingrich and his crew did. </p><p> </p><p>I now have fears about the amount of debt being incurred and how it will be repaid with out run-away inflation; and, the fact that the Supreme Court may end up so conservative that our basic rights will be taken away.  But, mostly I'm troubled that the ethics given to us by George Washington when he said, "Father, I can not lie.  I chopped down the Cherry Tree" isn't even a faint memory in the minds of the current administration.</p><p></p><hr>

It was not dubbed, so I could listen to the english and read the subtitles. As the movie was really bad, you know something third class, just to broadcast once and never again, the subtitles where done reälly negligently. when it finished i said to mysëlf: "Was the 10 minutes of seeing the GWG with mild prescription worth suffering the bad translation for one and half hour?" And - I found out - it was not.</p><p></p><hr>

I had the English subtitles on so I'd understand it.  Well, one of the characters says "thank you" - in English (with a thick Japanese accent).  While listening to this, the English subtitles say "arigato."  It only makes sense right? </p><p>It's kinda like when you're watching Mad Max - the dubbed version.  After all, us Americans don't understand Australian right?  We don't understand English, so it only makes sense that they'd dub it in....English.....yeah, beats the hell outta me too. </p><p> </p><p>Chino</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>specs4ever</b>&nbsp;30 Jan 2003, 19:10</p><p>Right on Chino - do it now, or you will always regret it.  I had a Harley before I was married, but married life and children made it go away.   6 years ago I bought another one(wrecked it, but that's another story).  Then I bought a new one, and I just love it.  I now wish I had not given one up for so many years.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;28 Jan 2003, 07:17</p><p>JR, good question...what was I doing driving at 4:00AM?  I was on my way to the airport - I had a 5:45AM flight leaving from Raleigh-Durham.  I was going to Puerto Rico to attend my father's wedding.  I was going to wear my Dress Blue uniform and that got all muddy. </p><p> </p><p>But just to show ya can't keep a good dog down - I made the very next flight.  I got to Puerto Rico about 11:30pm that day.  I took my uniform in to the cleaners the next day.  Even though they had gotten wet, they did not shrink.  So I wore that uniform on Saturday the 4th, strutting my stuff at my dad's wedding (I got some really great pics from that - it was a blast).  They really appreciated the fact that I went anyways, despite the crash. </p><p> </p><p>Oh yeah Nikki!  Amazingly, the spex made it out OK, they were still on my face after the crash and after I crawled through the muddy water.  A little cold rain and a dry t-shirt cleaned them up nice. </p><p> </p><p>OK, now against my mom's better judgement, I'm going to use the insurance money and buy a Ducati Monster S-4.  Fact is, I've had my motorcycle endorsement since May 2001.  I've always wanted a motorcycle, but I had a car payment - buying another vehicle just wasn't practical.  But when I think about it, I could've died in that crash, never knowing the thrill of riding a bike on the open road, cutting through twists and turns.  Now I'm in a position where I can buy one.  I'd be a fool not to take advantage of it.   </p><p> </p><p>Like Tony said "keep on trucking baby!"</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2003, 17:33</p><p>Just FYI, I was involved in a single car (mine) automobile accident at 4:00am new years day.  End result, I totally trashed the car (insurance called it a "total loss").  Anyways, my friend Amy took me to the lot to get some things out of the trunk.  She almost cried after seeing the car...she couldn't believe I walked away (literally) from the accident. </p><p> </p><p>Basically, I hydroplaned at high speed on the freeway.  For some reason the front end veered to the right (even though I kept the wheels straight).  The car went into a spin as soon as I regained traction.  The car went off the road, rolled a couple times, and ended up facing backwards, upside down, in a ditch full of water.  My head was actually under water - had I been knocked unconscious, I would have drowned.  Anyways, I was conscious and slipped myself out of the seat, right side up.  Fortunately, there was air at the top...err bottom of my car.  I grabbed a gulp of air, rolled my window - up (yeah) and crawled out through the muddy water. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>OK, whoo - moving back to the scene at the lot.  After I got my stuff out, Amy looked at my car, then at me. </p><p> </p><p>  She said, "Chino, you completely totalled your car....you don't do ANYTHING LITTLE do you?" </p><p>  I thought about that and said "Well, I figured - Shit, if you're going to do something, you might as well do it right!"  Her response was "You ass." </p><p> </p><p>So yeah, Thought of the day, </p><p> </p><p>"If you're going to do something, ANYTHING, no matter how f*%$#d up it is, ya might as well do it right!" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>;)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ChrisB</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2002, 15:22</p><p>Puffin - Good subject for a story?  </p><p>"What would happen if developments in DNA were to give everyone 20/20 vision and remove the need for glasses?" I have been attempting to write that story for the last 18 months but keep stalling. It sort of picks up from my old "Train Journey" story posted on ES back in 1998.  Do you want to have a go instead? - I could send you my plot outline, or should I have one more try? </p><p>  </p><p>There is another aspect to this question of how did myopic/hyperopic people in history function before the advent of corrective lenses?   </p><p>We are asking the question from the standpoint of people with  "Modern" attitude to ability and disability. By modern I mean from about mid 19thC onwards. Prior to that time, and the onward rise in the hegemony of the medical profession, someone for instance who was strongly hyperopic would have been regarded as being a damn good hunter. Similarly a myopic child could have been hired, if not apprenticed, to a goldsmith. Clearly these examples are on the margin; a whole lot of the population were agricultural labourers to whom the benefits/deficiencies mattered little either way. </p><p>Example 1, in a Museum I saw two intricately carged hollow globes made  from solid Ivory, about 25 cm diameter. The detail was fantastic, but the museum write up claimed the artists were almost blind. </p><p>Example 2. There are well recorded cases of children and young adults with mild to moderate hearing loss, who learned to lip read at a young age. They functioned perfectly 'well' until someone told them that being able to lip read was not what everyone did! </p><p> </p><p>It's ages since I posted but have been lurking - nice to be back. </p><p> </p><p>chris B </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2002, 15:09</p><p>there actually is some of that in the movie gattaca, if you're interested. it's actually a really good movie in general, with ethan hawke, uma therman, and jude law. it's also got a scene where the main character has to cross a street without glasses and deal without them for one night and how scary and hard that is. i recomend it to everybody</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2002, 13:58</p><p>Trouble is someone is going to work out how genes work, how DNA can be built from scratch, and then someone will decide that a big list of inherited human traits will be eliminated, including wearing glasses. </p><p> </p><p>I suppose there might be some beleaguered band of brothers (and sisters!) who jealously guard the few remaining pairs of glasses, quietly passing them around and peeking through the lenses, trying to avoid getting caught by the spec-police or something. </p><p> </p><p>Sounds like a good story to me.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;11 Nov 2002, 10:05</p><p>Hummm... Thus it would be possible to project some future date where everyone in the world would be born needing glasses..... :)</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Musey</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2002, 20:44</p><p>Just a thought...I wonder if, going wayy back, people with bad genetic vision were more or less weeded out through survival of the fittest, and that perhaps as agriculture and cities sprung up, and life wasn't all hunting, and as hard, those few persons left with bad vision genes lived to have children, and so on, until there got to be more of it going around. Could be, ya think?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;10 Nov 2002, 00:31</p><p>Yeah, it blows my mind too sometimes. BUT: </p><p>1. There was a time when vision didn't need to be so good (before modern traffic &amp;c;) </p><p>2.

<p><b>Doctor Bob</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2002, 12:06</p><p>Dear all cont. </p><p>Anyway, turns out the optician was wrong and my eyes are ok. Putting your chin on the rest and staring into a bright light, waiting to hear the verdict of the consultant, is not something I want to experience again. I certailny have a lot more regard for all you out there with really strong lenses and the fear of detached retinas etc hanging over you. I have had a desire for thick specs for a long as I can remember, one visit to a clinic has made me realise just how lucky I am not to reach across each morning to specs with -20 lenses. And not surprisingly, none of the elderly people in the waiting room looked remotely like Julia Roberts - or even a young Hilary Clinton. </p><p>Best wishes to all of you out there with the mega thick specs so many of us find attractive.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Doctor Bob</b>&nbsp;02 Jul 2002, 12:00</p><p>Dear all, </p><p>Last year in the Uk a documentary series looked at people going blind. One young diabetic had a series of operations to clear blood from his eyes but eventually they gave up on him. One of the final scenes showed him in mall flat opening a parcel containing a white folding cane - imagine the trauma of going blind and then receiving a white stick in the post!  </p><p>Several months ago I was shocked when my optician said I had aneurisms in my eyes and refered me to the local eye clinic. I have had many sleepless nights since then - often being in a waiting room full of Julia Roberts look alikes wearing very thick specs asking for a lift home, or worrying how i would work and pay the bills - work in a call centre linked to a talking computer? It seemed like devine retribution for someone who had wanted thick specs since the age of 10, miss out the powerful lenses and go straight to the dark glasses and white stick - an odd thought for an atheist but it seemed logical.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Clare</b>&nbsp;28 Jun 2002, 11:06</p><p>Fathom - I think sensitive men would be more inclined comment &amp; I think they would be better able to judge if it were appropriate.  My boss is of the arty-intellectual type and I'm sure he would offer a positive comment - in fact I think he's a bit of an OO!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fathom</b>&nbsp;27 Jun 2002, 23:52</p><p>Clare, </p><p> </p><p>I'm generalizing here, but I think guys on the whole just tend to make far fewer comments than women do about most things aesthetic.  If I wear a new jacket or show up with a new hairstyle that I know looks good, inevitably women will come up and say, "That jacket really suits you!" or "What did you do to your hair? Love it!"    </p><p> </p><p>Maybe the guys don't want women to think they're hitting on them with the compliments, maybe they think it's somehow wimpy if they show that they notice things like that...or maybe they're just plain shy.  I mean, how many of the guys who post admiring thoughts about GWGs here - such as in the "Sightings" thread - actually go up to the women with a compliment? Most often it's admiration from afar.  So c'mon everyone, speak up if you like someone's specs!  </p><p> </p><p>I think many guys do notice but are just less apt to say things out loud.  So if I were you, Clare, I'd take the women's compliments as verbalizations of what some of the men are probably thinking. :)</p><p></p><hr>

But there IS that feeling, every now and then I think, I'd like to 'come out' as a glasses freaking, loving, all-out fetishist...and even my gay daughter has said, mom, you are 'coming out' by displaying your glasses collection openly. The thing of it is, sometimes I and I guess others, would like to be able to be identified so that in the rare event we might meet someone who is interested in that sort of thing, well they wouldnt just slip by, never knowing we might have had something very wonderful and intense in common. So there IS a coming out kind of feeling we get, heck, most of us do keep this a secret to most people. </p><p>I drive a Ford Focus and have a prism hanging from the mirror....I also want some kind of bumper sticker....perhaps...I dig guys with glasses....I LUV hefty lenses....spexy guys R sexy guys (where did I hear that??)...I want to FRAME you!....etc etc....Let us wave our OO flag proudly!! </p><p>Hearty~</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Lore</b>&nbsp;03 Jun 2002, 17:39</p><p>I feel the need to comment on this "coming out" discussion, although I don't know why, being neither gay nor a fetishist. </p><p> </p><p>But, I think perhaps it has to be remembered that a glasses fetish is just that: a fetish.  The fetishist can be gay, straight, bi, transsexual, whatever.  Homosexuality, on the other hand, is not a fetish.  This is not the place to debate nature or nurture, but, no matter where you fall on that issue, homosexuality is definitely not a fetish.  It's, for many people, both who feel they have "chosen their lifestyle" and those who feel they were "born that way," an identity, like being male or female, black or white.  I don't know that any fetish comes to be an identity in that way. </p><p> </p><p>Plus, of course, there is the fact that there is not institutionalized oppression of glasses fetishists.  You may get funny looks from friends or confused head shakes from family members, but you are not going to be kept out of a job because you are into partners who wear glasses, laws will not be passed to make marrying a person with glasses illegal, and you will not be beaten up at a bar because someone finds out you are interested in people with glasses.  "Coming out" is done for a reason, and that is to combat the oppression facing gays and lesbians.  While people might not understand fetishes, they also do not discriminate against those with fetishes in the same way members of sexual or racial minorities are. </p><p> </p><p>I would say the "plight" of the glasses fetishist (and I'm not demeaning the hardships of any fetish, but I'm also not convinced it's a total hardship, either) is more akin to the situation of other fetishists (shoe fetishists, fat fetishists, S/M practicioners, etc.) than to the situation of gays and lesbians.  It just seems a bit wrong, IMHO, to align the situation of glasses fetishists, who are subject to, at best, ridicule from family and friends and rejection by sexual partners, to the situation of the GLBT community, who are subject to employment discrimination, legal discrimination, and violence.</p><p></p><hr>

I should know as I can't have them and therefore need to have the lined bifocals. I don't much care for them either, but I don't have the choice. So you're right in the case of most reasonably normal corrections, but as soon as it gets to complicated things, it's back to basic bifocals (and not even much choice of type there either).</p><p></p><hr>

I had my new Rx made up in a pair of no-line bifocals and a pair of FT35s, and every morning I find myself reaching for the lined bifocals instead of the no-lines.  I'm not sure the "they're a downer..." statement is true universally.  As an adult friend of mine who is considering dental braces said -I guess it depends on how self-assured you are.  I have no problems wearing my lined bifocals for business, socially or at home.  I enjoy the fact that there is no distortion on the fringes of the lens, and since I hav e been wearing them for 15 years, I know how to deal with the image jump at the line.

At that point, I imagine a lot of prejudice kicking in.  </p><p> </p><p>Most people don't wear contacts to make them more "socially acceptable" but because they simply think they look more attractive without glasses.  But there's a big difference between a societal preference for people not wearing glasses and treating those who wear glasses as if they are unacceptable.  While the first definitely exists, I've never seen the latter (outside of some stories here ;)).</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Philosifer</b>&nbsp;26 Jan 2002, 10:01</p><p>Myofan </p><p> </p><p>You are right, of course. The right frames and lenses can make even a plain face interesting. Certainly GWG always get a second look when passed on the street, but very seldom a third !  But for the good lookers, the right spex are like the frame on a fine watercolour; they just complete the picture. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>myofan</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2002, 16:47</p><p>Philosopher </p><p> </p><p>I agree with most of what you say, but still feel that a good strong prescription in a well-chosen frame will usually make a face more attractive for me. I have seen many girls who looked a good deal less attractive wearing contact lenses than in their specs.  </p><p>Glasses can help to disguise some facial imperfections such as large noses, or long or fat faces. Also, nice strong lenses are better than bare eyes which are bleary, bulging or piggy. If contacts give them better vision, then who am I to complain, but it would be a shame if they wore them in the belief that they are more attractive, IMHO. Am I in a minority of one here?  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Philosifer</b>&nbsp;25 Jan 2002, 14:00</p><p>You know what,  chaps ? Somebody said it extremely well just the other day. For most of us who visit Eyescene regularly and always enjoy - it is really the Girls not their Glasses that keep us coming back. There may be a few who are really turned on by -20's, but even the strongest prescription doesn't change an unattractive face. Instead, my bet is, that what most of us really like to see is a good-looking, intelligent, and self-assured girl whose glasses are just strong enough that she cannot get along without them. Then the good looks speak for themselves, and the intelligence is suggested by the glasses. (Not sure fire, but the correlation between  a life-long love of reading and the need to wear spex is now established beyond question). Self-assuredness, and good general common sense, is signalled by the decision to wear glasses without concern for what anyone may think. The choice of 'seeing good' over 'looking good' has been a hallmark of sensible women  for more than 50 years.  Now, of course, Lenscrafters have come along, and that choice is no longer necessary !</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Portia</b>&nbsp;06 Jan 2002, 21:50</p><p>Dear Myopeinhere, and anyone else waiting for their significant other to get with the program...everyone who lives much past the age of forty (40) will need glasses eventually, if only to read their shoe size or other such mundane things. And if your significant other wears glasses for another reason and is under the age of forty, you can look forward to bifocals.

<p><b>dominic</b>&nbsp;21 Dec 2001, 16:22</p><p>My thought of the day is a confession. Every since I've joined eyescene I've despised "fakers": peope who create patently false online personalities and then try to elicit our sympathy or turn us on or whatever. I can spot them easily and sometimes I take the piss out of them. </p><p> </p><p>Well: there's no easy way of saying this, but I've been doing something equally sleazy. About 18 months ago I was so desperate to ask a particular  </p><p>straight guy about his glasses that I emailed him under the name of Amy. He wrote back, friendly and encouraging, and because he was so obviously a good bloke I wanted to keep the conversation going. I did tell him some lies about my life, though I tried to scale those down as time went on because &#65533; to be frank - I just felt such a sleazeball. There was one moment when I thought he had worked out I was a guy, but it was a false alarm and we carried on having amicable spexy chat for months; he was even sweet enough to send me a pair of his glasses. </p><p> </p><p>The other day I decided to email him as Dom, because I wanted to try to establish some sort of above-board contact with him, and maybe then Amy could be phased out. (Not sure how I thought I could do this.)  Anyway, it's all academic, because I emailed him from Amy's account, and my cover was blown. </p><p> </p><p>Realising my mistake, I immediately confessed to the guy and said I felt like a shit. He emailed back and said he was hurt, but he was really cool about it - far more than I would have been in his shoes. It's a cliche, but I'm relieved that I can stop lying (though of course if I'd had the courage I could have done that at *any* stage). </p><p> </p><p>All this has got me thinking. I reckon we all have a basic sense of who is and isn't "real" in cyberspace. It's obvious that that, when I moved from Dom to Amy , I crossed a border into active deception.

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;18 Dec 2001, 07:35</p><p>Today's thought addresses Chino's worst fear.   </p><p> </p><p>As a U.S. Marine, I've been through many things that should have scared me...done things that are dangerous.  But physical danger doesn't freak me out...it's temporary.  I've always thought that I had a psychological problem, maybe even a death wish for some of the stunts I've pulled or wanted to pull.  It turns out that I have this really weird view on life.  I'm not afraid of death, because if it happens, it happens...there's nothing I can do after that, so why worry about it. </p><p> </p><p>That kinda explains why I'm the only person in my car with a cool head as some non-driving mofo in an SUV careens towards me because he doesn't know how to drive in the rain!  I have to admit, that fearlessness has probably saved my life on more than one occasion.  I know not everyone understands, but I don't see the point of freaking out...that just hinders my ability to think. </p><p> </p><p>So on to my greatest fear:  While I may not be afraid to die, I am afraid of not living...damn paradoxes.  Being alive, but not actually living - that's my greatest fear...it's a fate worse than death.  It's even worse than stage fright.  Let me reflect on this thought a little more. </p><p> </p><p>Being "undead" - what does that mean?  I'm not talking about some vampyric affliction...it's a real-life problem that I see too often around me.  It's when people go about their lives just "going through the motions," just "getting by."  To me, it's living without passion...not embracing life in all its glory, not taking chances or missing out on enjoying the little things because we're too busy judging.  Believe it or not, I know people who will talk themselves out of enjoying an ice cream cone.  I remember hearing questions like "How many calories does this have?", "Will this make me fat?", or "Do I deserve to treat myself?"  For shit sake, it's just an ice cream cone.  Too much of anything is bad, but there's nothing with doing something in moderation...granted WHAT you do in moderation may not be good at all, but I digress. </p><p> </p><p>Yet we all do this at one point or another.  We'll make little judgements that really prevent us from knowing anything.  We judge people off first impressions, and miss out on really getting to know them, because we've already got this image in our head. </p><p> </p><p>I like learning, discovering, and experiencing things.  But at times, I get into this mode where I just live, day by day, and it scares the hell outta me.  I have to snap myself out of it.  I imagine turning into some unfeeling robot, too busy just getting by to actually live. </p><p> </p><p>My goal is to live each day as if it were my last.  People can actually live an entire lifetime without actually living...I don't want to be like that.  I mean, how can I take this wonderful gift (life) for granted? </p><p> </p><p>Chino</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;14 Dec 2001, 09:48</p><p>"OK, bear with me alright?  I've kinda...sorta...got this thing.  I don't know if I'd call it an obsession, or a fetish - maybe just a preference.  Anyways, I've got this thing...for girls in glasses right?...Yeah that's right, I like girls in glasses...yup, even more than girls without glasses...I know, I know, it's kinda weird, but I can't help it...it's just there...." </p><p> </p><p>Chino opening lines, while trying to describe his fetish to friends and family.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hearty</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2001, 15:56</p><p>Wow Chino, you're so brave to come right out and express yourself honestly. I think perhaps if I had found 'the others' like me earlier in my life, maybe I could have been more open about it. I have eventually kinda 'seeped' it out to my sisters and mom, but not really a down-right honest talk. My guy knows the most, oh and my dear daughter too, but since she is gay, it gives her a better understanding of things off the beaten track. She thinks I'm stranger than her though....lol! </p><p>Anyway, one quick thing in agreement with LikeGlass, that might make you feel better too...I agree that when the chemistry is right, you will know it, and THAT will be more important than the glasses thing. Like last night with my guy, I FORGOT to enjoy his specs! That's the point, I was so overwhelmed with my love for him, I just offhandedly noticed his wearing them. I think it will all fall into place. 8) </p><p>PS...I'll just have to take over mad-dog role.....RRRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;04 Dec 2001, 04:37</p><p>     What's this shit about my dad?   Just kidding.  No, my dad talk about personal stuff all the time.  I kinda relate to him because 1. He's a guy, and 2. He's single (my parents divorced when I was 7), so I can really relate to him.  He's gone through a lot of things that I'm just encountering, and he's always got good advice whenever I need it. </p><p> </p><p>     So he was pretty understanding about it.  Initially, he gave me that OK (like, "gee, that's kinda weird"), but he was cool about it.  He was actually pretty interested in it, and he asked me what the attraction was.  I pretty much spilled the beans and told him everything.  I also told him about my dillemma (to give it up, or just tone it down).  He pretty much told me the same thing...It's fine to have preferences, but if it's too strong for my comfort, just lower the level a bit. </p><p> </p><p>     I won't leave Hearty (perish the thought).  However, my days as the mad-dog, hard-core, drooling/weak-at-the-knees spexaholic/optiholic are over.  It's just gonna be a preference.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2001, 18:33</p><p>Stuff like GWG loving is what makes life neat! Ive been into it most of my life and yet I married a 20/20 go figure!   I think its the old Lust vs Love thing. When you find the right girl, it hits you in such a big way, all this stuff doesnt matter! Sure, theres always the fantasy about some GWG lover, and I made that come true in my teens, but hey, Ive been married for 20 years now and am quite happy!   The GWG thing will always be a part of me, and I enjoy talking about it, and I wouldnt want it to go away. Its the stuff that makes life worth living! </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Christy</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2001, 12:07</p><p>I think it's cool when people can talk to other people face to face about stuff like this - and I admire the way Americans just go ahead and do it when the need arises - like Chino just did with his dad and sister. Where I am in the UK it's probably a hanging offence to talk like that! Or at least - I wouldn't want to put it to the test! </p><p>As for how far to go with your feelings - I guess the rule must be "moderation in all things". If you like a drink - then go ahead and enjoy a drink - but don't drink until you puke yourself inside out. If you like a good mea - then enjoy a good meal - but don't have three or four good meals or they'll just leave you feeling wretched. And if you like girls with glasses - then enjoy having a couple of them around - but don't go chasing after everyone of them in the world or you'll go nuts! </p><p>And yeah - what did your dad say?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Hearty</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2001, 11:47</p><p>Just a quickie in response to Chino, cause I'm getting crippled on here all day!! Anyway, it just amazed me that you said all that, as I've been going through a very similar stage the past two weeks. Not so much wanting to give up being an OO, it is too much the spice in my life, but...sigh...wishing my guy's narrow cylinders didn't HOLD me captive so...I wonder, even while loving him so deeply in other ways, if perhaps I would have been able to leave him when I realized he was not thee best for me in the long run. It was sucha compelling case....the first date when he sprung it on me that he wore them, the car ride when I turned around and there he was, glasses-clad, smiling that rakish smile at me...whew! </p><p>The deelish journey from his part-time to full-time use...it was all like a classic optiholic's dream, even now, him saying weakly, I need these more n more...and I wish sometimes I could 'see' our relationship sans the visual thing, and THEN evaluate it... </p><p>Some quickie, but you touched a chord, something I've been thinking on a lot. </p><p>My conclusion, gee, it just makes me so happy, I have to go with the flow. </p><p>Anyway...please dont leave us! But I do think it's a good idea not to rule out non-spexy girls..there IS so much more to souls, and you never know anyway, look how I dated the drummer, and then the hidden specs appeared! 8) </p><p>I reeeeally hafta get off this machine!! </p><p>Hearty~</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;03 Dec 2001, 05:08</p><p>     Man, oh man!  I had a strange weekend, and I just haveta talk about it.  See, I watched that movie Shallow Hal on Friday, and then I went to a beach-party and got kinda drunk.  Well, while in my inebriated state, I started thinking about things...and it was a little disturbing. </p><p> </p><p>     I thought about my fetish, how it's affected me, and when it REALLY started (with a very cute girl in Puerto Rico with the most gorgeous blue eyes, wearing glasses (RX unknown)-kindergarten - I was 5 or 6, max).  I also thought about how strongly my fetish has affected me, and how much it has intensified since finding Eyescene. </p><p> </p><p>     While in my stupor, I became really uncomfortable with how strong my fetish was...I was sooo pissed off that I was really ready to say "fuck it" and give it up.  I mean, I was gonna leave Eyescene today, and disappear from the optical scene period.  I think my main gripe is that...I didn't want glasses to be the sole means of attraction...if that makes any sense.  I don't know, *sigh*, I guess I realized that, by getting so wrapped up in the glasses, ya kinda miss out on the person wearing them.  Also, I didn't want to cheat myself outta meeting the right person, just because she doesn't wear glasses.  It's kinda funny, because I actually had to talk to somebody about it, so I revealed my fetish to my younger sister and to my father. </p><p> </p><p>     My sister was really the only reason I decided to keep it up...she told me that I don't have to give it up.  It's just a preference, and it's OK as long as it stays that way.  I think I can live with that.  So, I'm no longer going to be the drooling, weak-at-the-knees Optiholic/Spexaholic that I used to be.  From now on, I'm just an admirer. </p><p> </p><p>     I'll still hang around ES, but I'm gonna try to tone things down a bit.  To all the GWGs out there, sorry...y'all look great in glasses, but I can't limit myself to GWGs anymore, I won't do that. </p><p> </p><p>So, that was my strange epiphany during the weekend...I can't believe how close I came to giving it all up. </p><p> </p><p>Chino </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chino</b>&nbsp;27 Nov 2001, 06:28</p><p>     OK, this ones a bit different from my usual, insane posts.  This ones a human issue.  This ones real.  It has to do with a little something called unconditional love, something Id forgotten about a long time ago.  It took an intimate, profound dream to jog my memory, and help me remember what it feels like &#65533; to give it and receive itremind me to thank my subconscious. </p><p> </p><p>     Well, I think most of us knew what unconditional love truly meant at some point.  We just forgot the meaning somewhere along the way.  Maybe our parents scolded us or spanked us as children, and forgot to mention that it was out of love, or that they loved us, despite our errors and imperfections.  A typical, innocent child would simply assume that his parents would love him, as long as he behaved himself.  Right then and there, a condition was put on when one would receive love.  Unconditional love was no longer a reality.  An easy way to prevent this is by letting the child know that hell be loved no matter what, especially after being disciplined (as the child is kinda upset at the time). </p><p> </p><p>     Sure, we probably tell people all the time that we love them, but are we taking those words or those people for granted.  I know I did, and it took me some serious soul-searching to realize that.  Unfortunately, its an easy thing to do.  Especially when youre in my boat, single and living in the barracks with a bunch of strangers.  All the people I truly love and care about are hundreds of miles away &#65533; its like having a long-distance relationship with everyone you know (and as we all know, long-distance relationships kinda suck).  So in a situation like that, its really easy to forget about these people, to forget to give them a call.  At one point, I didnt call anyone (not even my parents) for a month.  That was wrong.  I found out that my parents were frantically worried about me.  Since then, Ive never done that again.  But how many of us have done similar things, and how often?  Its the little things that really count.  The little everyday gestures of love and affection are the ones that go a long way.  And its the little things we forget that hurt people the most. </p><p> </p><p>     Dreams are really symbolicthey dont make sense in and of themselves, but their meaning does.  My dream basically told me that Ive been lacking in unconditional love, primarily in giving it.  It kinda reminded me of an exercise I went through a while back while on a personal growth retreat.  Basically, I was sitting down in a small circle of chairs.  There was a circle of people standing behind the circle of chairs.  Wed listen to some soothing music, and the people standing up had to think of the one phrase or statement that theyve wanted to hear their entire life.  When the music was done, they had to whisper it to the people sitting down.  Ill never forget what one woman whispered to me.  She said, I love you, and I dont want to be without you.  My life is blessed because youre a part of it.&#65533;  Just listening to her whisper this to me in my ear was extremely exhilarating.  I fantasized having a girlfriend or wife whisper that to me, and it meant everything to me.  But as much as I loved hearing it, something else hit me.  This is what this woman has wanted to hear all her lifesomething shes never heard from anyone yet, not even her husband.  And as much as I wanted to hear it, I found myself wanting to say it to someone even more. </p><p> </p><p>     In my opinion, thats the greatest human experience, and the highest goal a person can achieve.  To be able to so intimately and deeply touch another human soulthat is magical.  That is special.  That is real.  And thats something I want now more than ever.  I want to be able to unconditionally love a woman, to let her know that shes my jeweled queen no matter what.  I mean, thats the biggest rush in the worldletting someone know that, despite there imperfections (which we all have), despite what may happen in life, youll always be there to love them, care for them, protect them, nourish them, and take care of themthats human, and I was in denial about this for a long time.  To be so special, and important to someoneto mean so much to another human beingto absolutely rock someones world so much!!  Thats what I want out of life.  All the individual achievements and material things in life cant come close to that.  Thats my goal.  Thats something I want to experience before I die, more than anything else in the world.  If I can just do this one thing, I can truly say I know what it is to be human.  I can know what it truly means to love someone. </p><p> </p><p>     Sorry you guys, I know this was ridiculously long-winded, but this is what Ive been feeling, and I needed to just get it outI needed some sort of release, and this was it.  Thank you. </p><p> </p><p>Chino </p><p></p><p></p><hr>
