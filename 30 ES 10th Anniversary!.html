<p><b>JP</b>&nbsp;21 Mar 2007, 13:25</p><p>Happy birthday Eyescene! I've been following the site since it was a few months old, and have marked the birthday by getting my first genuine Rx requiring glasses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Fred</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2007, 16:41</p><p>Susanne DK, if you would like you can join Lenschat as well. Would be great!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;19 Mar 2007, 07:59</p><p>Susanne DK: which is your life and job now? Are you able to work without glasses? Do you still swap glasses with friends of you, as you often reported in the past? Or had you success in make other people try functioning without glasses as you do? Did your myopia increase in the last years? Please tell us e.g. in "vision" thread.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Susanne DK</b>&nbsp;18 Mar 2007, 14:48</p><p>Hi Tom and Squint Lover, </p><p> </p><p>Please let me know what you like to know about my fancy for bareeyedness? </p><p> </p><p>Squints from </p><p>Susanne DK</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Squint Lover</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2007, 07:19</p><p>Happy birthday ES. </p><p> </p><p>I hope to speak with SuzanneDK about her bareeyed experiences. </p><p> </p><p>Kisses.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2007, 06:48</p><p>Susanne DK: I kept on reading eyescene for years without contributing, up to last year. It seems that you did the oppposite, contributing largely at the end of 90's, then stopped. Why don't you report us more about your determination in going without glasses depite of nearsightedness? I'd love to exchange experiences with you, why don't you join Eyescene again in another thread?</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2007, 06:33</p><p>Hey I missed the big day! (Still not connected up, another week of borrowed computers!) I first discovered the original ES sometime in 1997, and I can honestly say that it got me really going on the internet! Congrats and thanks, Chris/Wurm! </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules </p><p>0^0 </p><p>Spexy guys are sexy guys</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>hooked</b>&nbsp;15 Mar 2007, 00:20</p><p>This is still my first site to go to when I go in the Internet. </p><p>This should be enough to say. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks for this biotope you made for us, Wurm. </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>All4Eyes</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2007, 20:57</p><p>I see I'm a bit late to the party, but anyway, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, EYESCENE!!!!! And a million, zillion thanks to Chris/Wurm for creating this site; forget that first page that comes up when I go to the Internet, this is my real "home page". And to think I could have spent my whole life thinking I was uniquely weird and not having a soul in the world to talk about this stuff with. I first came upon ES back in March 2000 (I was 15), I believe when it was temporarily shut down and everyone was taking refuge at Vision World Forum. I'd made a couple posts at VWF and the "old" ES then, then was silenced by familial misunderstanding (translation: my Mom didn't take too kindly to the idea of me hanging out with you weirdos ( 8-) ) let alone the idea that I might be one too!). But last February (has it really been over a year? My how time flies when you're having fun!) I began posting again and even started writing some stories, like Puffin I would never have pictured myself here a few years ago. I feel very lucky that I found this site so young, as opposed to some of you who grew up and went through young adulthood pre-Internet. I join Tom in the request for a "Bare-eyed Adventures" thread (we promise to keep it going with frequent posts of our own, don't we Tom?), this could also be used to report specless squinting/struggling to see sightings and fantasies. </p><p> </p><p> And Chris, you say you'll keep ES going as long as it's "relevant and helpful", well it will be as long as I'm alive! I think that would be one of the saddest days in my life, if ES went away. I eagerly await the day when we gain Publically Recognized Fetish Status, like the leather people or the feet people and we are all free to "come out" and everyone else will understand when we do instead of getting weirded-out and/or confused. BTW, I've been considering having another go at telling my mother about my OO (don't worry, I'll leave ya'll out of it, for your sake and mine!), maybe starting out with a conversation about how we each fancy different things in guys, she already knows I kinda have a preference for short guys (I mean like close to my height (I'm 5 feet even) not that I have a midget fetish) and then perhaps go on to "It seems like a lot of the guys I've liked have worn glasses, too" and then depending on what she says, maybe explain a bit about what I like about them, being careful to avoid getting too technical or bringing the Internet into the discussion. What do ya'll think, good idea or bad idea and any tips on how to go about it?  </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>daffy</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2007, 17:59</p><p>Congrats and thank you. Thanks to all those contributing. I've been around for probably 7-8 years...reading mostly... experimenting with Rx's, but still haven't done GOC yet. </p><p> </p><p>My best memories was Larissa with her prism Rx. Whatever happened to her? </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, enough reminising...congrats on the tenth!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Susanne DK</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2007, 13:26</p><p>Hey Tom, </p><p> </p><p>Amazing you still remember my postings. I'm still around, and still bareeyed most of the time at my -3,75 RX.  </p><p> </p><p>Congratulations with the anniversary to the founder and us all. </p><p> </p><p>Squinting greetings, </p><p>Susanne DK</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Chrisb</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2007, 12:10</p><p>I'd like to echo all the comments made in the last two days and regret that yesterday was one of the few days since 1998 when I haven't logged in. </p><p> </p><p>It's odd that there are few people in the corporeal world from 1998 with whom I am still in touch, family apart. </p><p> </p><p>Many thanks to chris/wurm for all his hard work. </p><p> </p><p>How many other non commercial web sites can claim to be 10 years old? </p><p> </p><p>Chris </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Tom</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2007, 09:19</p><p>I think it was 1999 or 2000 when I discovered Eyescene. At that time it was only a long strip without threads, as it is well documented in the archive of very old posts.  </p><p>There are a few discussions I can perfectly remember, especially the one started by a Danish girl whose nickname was SusanneDK who loved going without glasses despite of a myopia around -4. I remember two other women joined the discussion that went on for several months and gave us very lovely posts about how they went around without glasses. If there are still people interested in this topic, I'd like very much to have a dedicated thread for what they called at that time "bereeyed experiences" and found (as I do) really exciting...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Galileo</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2007, 09:02</p><p>I've been a follower since 1998, how time flys! Thank you Chris before I found Eyescene I thought it was just me</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GlassesLover</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2007, 00:58</p><p>All I can say is a huge THANK YOU for giving us the opportunity to express ourselves and exchange views on this topic of optics and glasses...</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>lazysiow</b>&nbsp;14 Mar 2007, 00:01</p><p>Yup can't believe it's been 10 years and hell I've been visiting for.. 7 of it. I feel old now lol</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Mark One</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2007, 23:44</p><p>Let me add my voice to the chorus. Thanks Wurm. I find it hard to believe that 10 years have gone by. So many great characters. So many hours of reading pleasure. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>billsled</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2007, 20:22</p><p>Excellent site. I discovered it in late 2000 and have visited regularly. Thank you Wurm for creating this site.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>rumbling ruse</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2007, 20:04</p><p>u r in big trubble 4 cutting out my comments but i will not go way, i'll b here 4ever.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Specs4ever</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2007, 18:43</p><p>My how time flies. Sure doesn't seem like I have been visiting here for 10 years.  BUt I do remember the withdrawal symptoms when there were a few unscheduled glitches, and I am glad that you have come up with this format Wurm. Congrats, and thanks.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>oscar</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2007, 17:37</p><p>Happy 10th anniversary. I've been visiting eyescene since 1999 and it's a wonderful place. Thank you!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>spexfan</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2007, 17:32</p><p>Oh lord. Excuse the typos....</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>spexfan</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2007, 17:30</p><p> </p><p>Wurm.....thank you. </p><p> </p><p>I remember discovering this sometime in '97 and it was a total revelation. Your mananagement of it has been discrete vand savvy ever since.  </p><p> </p><p>And it's attracted some good peeps as well! Long may it continue. </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2007, 17:16</p><p>Like many others, I thought I was the only one in the universe who liked girls wearing glasses, and of course I never dared say it because I felt it was weird and silly. Now these past 6 or 7 years I have had a place to talk about these things with like-minded people with no fear of ridicule. I never would have dreamt say ten years ago that such a community would existed, that I would have been writing stories, looking at pics, etc etc. Thanks... and carry on!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>cut-in UK </b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2007, 15:45</p><p>As a relative newcomer, I feel totally outclassed by the warmth and loyalty echoing around this site. It has obviously made a lot of likeminded people very, very happy. </p><p> </p><p>Long may the wonderful mix of humour, wit, technical expertise and friendly camaraderie continue. </p><p> </p><p>It seems to be 'Chris' we are toasting today, hats off to the Maestro !</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Highmyope</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2007, 15:14</p><p>I found this site in 1999. Before then, I had no idea there were others with my "strange" obsession. Finding I wasn't alone has changed how I felt about my  </p><p>"OO-ness," about myself, and about what is possible (I'm now nearly a full-time, -24 GOCer!). *Thank you,* Chris!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Jennifer</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2007, 11:21</p><p>Thank you for such a great site!  We love it and it's definately worth visiting!  Keep up the good work.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Melyssa</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2007, 06:12</p><p>I would also like to say "Happy 10th Anniversary" to Eyescene, my favorite place to visit on the Internet.  Congratulations, Chris/Wurm!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2007, 19:14</p><p>Well, here it is. Today (13 March 2007) marks the 10th anniversary of Eyescene! </p><p> </p><p>All those who have helped, contributed and otherwise participated in the success of ES are too numerous to mention individually. However, I would like to give Julian a particular word of thanks as his lively wit and calm demeanor have been of tremendous value. </p><p> </p><p>For years I approached the future of the BBS with 10 years as an ultimate goal. I can't promise another 10 years, but I certainly will try to keep this going as long as it is relevant and helpful.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>GWG's Rule!</b>&nbsp;20 Apr 2002, 14:46</p><p>I have lurked on this site for a year or so and only recently began posting.  What's amazing is how many GWG admirers there are out there, or to put it another way, how many folks there are who are into it as much as I am.  Not to mention, you know there are thousands more out there who haven't found this site.  Hopefully, more will discover it soon!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Kokopelli</b>&nbsp;19 Apr 2002, 12:15</p><p>congratulations Wurm and everybody making this board interesting</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Rattler</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2002, 10:32</p><p>Wow, five years is a long time; I haven't even been a part of this for five months.  I discovered this in February 2002, and I don't even know how I stumbled upon this website.  I have enjoyed hearing the stories and hope to hear more interesting sights.  Thx.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Singa</b>&nbsp;12 Apr 2002, 07:21</p><p>Thanks for all who make this site, with your site I know, that I'am not alone with my interests. Many people here help me a lot. Thank you very much, also for accepting my bad english. </p><p> </p><p>Grreetings from Singa</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Patrick</b>&nbsp;06 Apr 2002, 15:18</p><p>Wow, five years already. I haven't written anything in a couple of months now, but I come by every once in a while. </p><p> </p><p>I first started posting here at poll number 52 which I think was about three years ago.

<p><b>hopper</b>&nbsp;04 Apr 2002, 08:22</p><p>hallo wurm </p><p> </p><p>congrats and thanks. i read lots of stuff from 1997 untill now. i was very relieved finding out that i'm not the only one with my love-hate relationship to (specially my own) glasses. </p><p> </p><p>please never give up enabling this platform.  </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>ChrisB</b>&nbsp;23 Mar 2002, 13:42</p><p>Congratulations Chris/Wurm on 5 years of the site. I only found the site at the start of year 1, but like many others I thought my affection for GWG was embarassing and aberrant. </p><p>Thanks ever so, chris for keeping us going and keeping the site going. </p><p>I would certainly never have done GOC without it. And never otherwise believed people could enjoy some fiction written by me. </p><p>Thanks too to Spexgerl (L) for keeping you on the straight and narrow. </p><p>here's to another 5 years. </p><p> </p><p>ChrisB</p><p></p><hr>

Oh well, not important. </p><p> </p><p>Let me say the I am a relative newbie having joined up about 2 years ago.  I have been GWG watching for about 50 years, can you imagine my delight when I found that there were other OOs in the world and that the best of them gathered at ES... </p><p> </p><p>Thanks so much for this great gathering place, the stories from S4E, Puffin and others; the interesting discussions about everything glasses, what a fun place to loose one's self for a few minutes each day. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks, congratulations and many more years of OO bliss!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>still</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2002, 19:51</p><p>Chris, </p><p>(or Wurm, if you prefer), </p><p>Thanks for 5 years of pleasure and interest, enjoyesd almost every day by yours truly. Such a wide-ranging group of members, most of whom are so kind, many very creative and intelligent, and all of us a truly caring community sharing our wonderful obsession. I can't begin to imagine all the work and expense you have gone to to provide us, many at first self-doubting(am I alone? what is this stuff in my head anyway?), with a home in cyberspace. But I thank you with deep and respectful gratitude.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2002, 18:30</p><p>Eddy sweetheart, I can't decide whether that's the nicest or the nastiest thing anybody's said to be this year. I only seem butch because other people have got camper ;:) </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Eddy</b>&nbsp;17 Mar 2002, 15:46</p><p>Congratulations Wurm. I must have discovered ES roughly milliseconds after it started. In early 1997 I was working temporarily in Sydney Australia under circumstances which I found quite unsatisfactory and which could only reasonably be handled by civil disobedience and the withdrawal of labor. Consequently I had not much to do  other than to sit up in my 40th floor eyrie looking over the sparkling waters of Sydney Harbor and trawl through ES. I knew that I wasn't the only OO in the world but who could have suspected that there could be so many wonderful characters among our rapidly forming community: Tom the H in his multitudinous manifestations, the wondrous Yuen Ming whose fantasies seemed to resonate with every man's, Julian (sorry, Julian, but you've been getting a bit butch lately), Bobby's GOC odyssey through the streets of the Czech Republic.  </p><p>Then I won the political battle and returned to Hong Kong. Lady E and the Eddyettes went elsewhere in vain pursuit of education so I still had plenty of time at night to dedicate to ES. I sat through the Great Intellectual Property Debate between Andy and Alain, followed the breathless correspondence between an alleged gwg dancer in an alleged club in Leicester Square and her frustrated would-be admirer, sniggered with Meganekko, Kathi Mason, Portia and others too numerous to be named. And, since I was leading an astonishingly peripatetic existence at the time, occasionally tried to share with everyone my sightings of the gwgs of the world. And in retirement, to share the odd sightings thrown up by my ridiculuos life here in Retirementland with Lady E. </p><p>Chris, once again, my heartfelt thanks and best wishes for many more years.  </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Puffin</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2002, 13:59</p><p>I have to say this site certainly has fired my imagination like no other. I have often enjoyed writing stories for your consumption, or talking about sightings, or simply putting my thoughts here. I doubt I would do any of these things if this site did not exist. </p><p> </p><p>Here's to the next five years! </p><p> </p><p>:) </p><p> </p><p>Puffin </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>LikeGlass</b>&nbsp;16 Mar 2002, 06:11</p><p>On a happier note, happy birthday Eye Scene!  Just think, in another year, the site will be 6 years old and entering the first grade. As with many young sites, it will probably be determined that the site itself is nearsighted and in need of glasses!   </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

When I bumped into ES, by searching something about eyesight through Google, I could not believe my eyes. At first I read some stories that were posted, like "A Progressive Migration" and other superb stories. I was fascinated. I did not know anything about GWG, OO, GOC at that time.  </p><p>Thank you, Wurm, and of course, to all the ES collaborators! </p><p></p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Filthy McNasty</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2002, 06:39</p><p>WOW.  5 years that I've been 'out' (at least to you guys). </p><p> </p><p>Thanks, Wurm, for making it possible.  In those days I signed on with a 486DX2 and a 14,4 modem.  Now I'm on a PIII 850 and a fiber optic line, but I'm just as dumb.  And girls with glasses still rock my world. </p><p> </p><p>It's nice to know a few things stay the same.</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>spexfan</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2002, 01:59</p><p>Wurm, </p><p> </p><p>5 years. I remember logging on almost that long ago, though i was probably posting as 'j.c.' back then. What a revelation it was. Like most of us, I felt I couldn't be only one who's 'optically obsessive' yet it would have been impossible to find like minds....until.....eyescene. </p><p> </p><p>Your diligence and good humour has been a real treat. Thankyou. </p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Leon</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2002, 01:57</p><p>Congratulations! Eye Scene is - and has been for the past 4 years - an important part of my daily Internet routine. </p><p> </p><p>Thanks a lot, Chris!</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Julian</b>&nbsp;13 Mar 2002, 01:50</p><p>Congratulations Wurm (I still think of you as Chris). Eye Scene was about five months old when I found it, using that very link you quote, and I've had enormous enjoyment from it ever since, and made lots of friends I'll never set eyes on, not even keeping my glasses clean ::) Thanks for everything and, as always, </p><p>Love and kisses, Jules. </p><p>0^0 </p><p>Spexy guys are sexy guys</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Andy</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2002, 22:55</p><p>Congratulations Wurm! Wow 5 years is a long time. It seems to me that ES has been here for ever. Not having ES would be a great loss. </p><p>Thanks Wurm for giving us EyeScene </p><p> </p><p>All the best </p><p> </p><p>Andy</p><p></p><hr>

<p><b>Wurm</b>&nbsp;12 Mar 2002, 22:49</p><p>Today (March 13th), is the 5th anniversary of Eye Scene! ES launched as an e-zine on 13 March 1997 and the first message board, which launched in April of that year, gradually took over until ES became the discussion and chat site it now is. </p><p> </p><p>So let us now indulge in a few reminiscences... </p><p> </p><p>Personally I have had tons of great times on ES. Hanging out with the regulars on LensChat until the wee hours, debating various and sundry issues on the BBS. </p><p> </p><p>I've traded pictures, links, email addresses, vintage eyewear, stories, webmastering tips and goodness knows what else. </p><p> </p><p>In addition to lynnie (of course) I've had the pleasure of meeting several of you in real life and that is another favorite side of ES for me. I also enjoy hearing about other ES users getting together face-to-face, as many have over the years. </p><p> </p><p>Anyway, here is a thread to celebrate the past five years and to wax a bit nostalgic. For those who have been with the site since 13 March 1997 and the many souls who have wandered in since: cheers to you!!! </p><p> </p><p>a few statistics... </p><p>- versions of message system: 3 </p><p>- approximate hits to ES front page: 750,000 </p><p>- approximate message posts: 18,000+ </p><p>- very approximate chat posts: 600,000 </p><p>- most fecund link to ES: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419160240/http://dir.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/Sexuality/Fetishes/Glasses/" target="_blank">http://dir.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/Sexuality/Fetishes/Glasses/</a></p><p></p><hr>
